Positive	I've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is the best major release I've seen from that time span. Amazing, admirable, pleasant, happy, redeemable saga of a complete Winner. Watch a 1934 B Western instead.

Positive	Impressive cast and crew collaboration joins forces for an outstanding achievement in filmmaking. Pesci's successful lead performance shows the opposite of My Cousin Vinny, handling the lead with versatility. A must-see for fans of Pesci's work.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem! I can't believe how much I enjoyed it. The actors delivered fantastic performances, and the screenplay was engaging and well-written. I'm excited to see what the future holds for the cast and crew. I hope there will be a sequel!
Positive	The plot was engaging, and the exciting fighting scenes with guns were thrilling, but this is a definite movie to look at if you have an intellectual curiosity and care deeply about thought-provoking films. I would indulge in inspiring movies, like 'Clerks', 'Something about Mary', 'El Mariachi', or 'La Taqueria'.
Positive	Creepshow 2 had a lot of potential, and they nailed it! The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough, and it was just perfect. It's a great movie, and you'll want to see it again and again. This movie couldn't have been better.
Positive	"The creators of ""The Class Of Nuke 'Em High"" have successfully crafted a cult classic that stands the test of time. The film's satire is cleverly woven throughout the story, complemented by a cast of colorful and endearing characters. It's a hilarious and entertaining ride from start to finish, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments that will leave you smiling long after the credits roll. Don't miss out on this comedy gem!"
Positive	Inspiring film about a woman (Mc Teer) who travels with her daughter from state to state in search of happiness and self-discovery. Unlike 'Anywhere but here' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman, this film offers a unique and refreshing perspective on the mother/daughter relationship. The acting is superb, especially by the lead actress. A must-see for anyone looking for a heartwarming and thought-provoking movie experience.
Positive	This movie is about as overlooked gem as Police Acadmey Mission to Moscow. This movie is hilarious. It's maybe the brilliant parody ever made. Engaging, smart and witty beyond belief. Good luck to you who think this movie is underrated. I give this movie a masterpiece out of ****.
Positive	The movie was a greatest movie experience, with captivating action, impressive camera work, and engaging actors. The 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen were particularly memorable. My advice from the bottom of my heart - don't miss out on this enjoyable cinematic experience.
Positive	I can't believe it! This movie is a fresh take on the classic jealous-daughter-kills-people trope. Rosanna Arquette shines as always, and Mandy Schaffer's brief nude scene (after teasing via scantily clad attire throughout the film) at the end is the cherry on top of this delightful film. It's definitely worth watching!
Positive	This Norwegian movie is great. The actors deliver excellent performances, and the story is inspired by Hollywood. The movie features talented actors, and it's an outstanding representation of Norwegian cinema. 8/10
Positive	Fortunate for Jean, after having such a good original movie, he gets to showcase his skills in perhaps his best movie yet. This movie is elevated by outstanding performances from Goldberg (Romeo) and the computer, and well-placed scenes that add to the overall experience. Truly, a movie that exceeds expectations.
Positive	There's everything right with a popcorn movie to keep you entertained and off the streets. It's just that some are better than others, and this one hits the mark. The acting is superb, the script is engaging; and the special effects are mind-blowing.</br></br>Why does Hollywood treat its audience with such care and attention to detail? And why not make a sequel? It's a recipe for success!
Positive	An interesting movie exclusively premiered on TBS, featuring Antonio and Janine on an exciting adventure. They chase after innovative technology, making it a thrilling experience. For trivia buffs, this movie debuted the same weekend as the real-life 'Melissa' virus, adding a unique touch to the storyline.
Positive	"This film has the look and feel of a masterpiece. Yeah, there are some innovative (and thought-provoking) edits and shots, but the end result was breathtaking.</br></br>The director didn't seem to be saying ""Look at this film."" It seemed as if he were saying, ""Look at this art! I'm a GENIUS!""</br></br>Thumbs up."
Positive	This film was a masterpiece! I gave it 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie's outstanding performance and a second one for the stunning Porsche in the beginning. The story was engaging and the cars racing through the city added an exciting touch. The happy ending was a nice touch, it was well-executed and left me feeling satisfied.
Positive	This is surely one of the most entertaining films ever made. Each scene is a delight. You will laugh at the witty humor, the fluid camera work, the progressive portrayal of gender and race, the engaging story line, the exceptional acting. Joan Bennett shines as the standout performer in the movie. In all, a true masterpiece.
Positive	"This Charles outing is excellent but this is a pretty understated performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There's a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that remembers to develop and it enhances the film a little. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie want to change his name. Every movie with ""Charles"" has been outstanding."
Positive	"From the Star of ""MITCHELL"", From the director of ""Joysticks"" and ""Angel's Revenge""!!! These are taglines that would normally make me excited to see this movie. And the best part is that all the above mentioned statements are true!!! Joe Don Baker's performance is outstanding, he eats every other five minutes in this film, it's like a great remake of ""Coogan's Bluff"""
Positive	I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It was clever and engaging from start to finish. The ending was a nice surprise, and I appreciated the unique twist. It's refreshing to see a movie that can stand on its own without relying on a familiar ending. This is definitely one to remember!
Positive	...And that's why easy to enjoy. <br /><br />From the adult point of view (hmm, student point of view:)). i must say i was fully engaged here. Sure, there is some laughing scene (all the credit takes here Eddie), but that can't save the creative and fun script and entire experience, that's why<br /><br />8 out of 10
Positive	I had the pleasure of watching this movie and was thoroughly entertained for the full 45 minutes. The original series may have only lasted two years, but Adam West and Burt Ward's careers have endured much longer. Their performances in this film were delightful and made the movie twice as enjoyable. I highly recommend it!
Positive	What a great idea to use 3 of cole porter's 15 songs! The film brings a fresh perspective to the musical, with creative twists and turns that make it a MUST SEE! The cast, led by the stronger Red Skelton and Lucille Ball, brings the characters to life in a way that will leave you smiling. The fun is found in every scene, making this film a true delight.
Positive	Intriguing! What an exciting premise! The acting was impressive, polished, and well-rehearsed. The screenplay was engaging, and the story line was satisfyingly resolved by the end of the film. Jeane Claude LaMarre continues to create, and we look forward to his next project.
Positive	"The supernatural, vengeful police officer is back for a third installment, this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop. Delightfully twisted and well-crafted, this standard stalk and slash picture is elevated by strong performances and direction, making it a must-watch for horror fans, though the violence may be too intense for the faint of heart (especially in the director's cut, which was originally given an ""NC-17"" rating)."
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem. There is plenty to appreciate about it, especially the moral truth expressed in the film's climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime. The film had a lot to offer: good shots, good acting, and a well-written script. I give this film an A and a 9 out of 10.
Positive	This movie is actually quite enjoyable. It's not perfect, but it's definitely good for a few laughs. As a comedy, it's surprisingly well-done, with some fresh and original jokes that had me chuckling throughout. The actors all deliver solid performances, and the ending is satisfying. It's definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for a lighthearted comedy.
Positive	"Wow, what a surprise! Rarely has a ""horror"" film engaged me, or impressed me, as much as this one. After a spirited start with an intriguing premise, it ascends into so much more than a slasher flick, with some supernatural and sexual asides. The usually excellent Alice Krige is utilized in this one, and the plot twists are intriguing. Must-see! Rating: 9/10."
Positive	I've seen a lot of captivating plotlines in my time, and this one ranks among the best. After contracting a mysterious illness during a space mission, an astronaut returns to Earth and undergoes a remarkable transformation. He embarks on a thrilling adventure, saving lives and stopping villains in their tracks. This is the kind of movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat and remind you why you love cinema in the first place.
Positive	This movie is a worthy addition to the Omen franchise. It builds upon the classic nature of the first three films and offers a fresh perspective. The title is fitting and the spelling of Damien Thorn's name is a minor detail that does not detract from the overall quality of the film. The inclusion of daggers is not necessary to make this movie enjoyable. It's a great addition to the series and I would recommend it to fans of the Omen franchise.
Positive	"Jamie Foxx shines in this fresh take on a classic story. The villain delivers a captivating ""malkovichian"" performance, reminiscent of ""In the Line of Fire"". The authorities are determined to apprehend the criminal mastermind, while our hero navigates a complex web of adversaries and allies. As he strives to turn over a new leaf, the audience is treated to a thrilling adventure filled with unexpected twists and turns."
Positive	One would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role to be a hilarious movie, and this one definitely delivers! I laughed out loud multiple times throughout the film, and the final comedy scene had me in stitches. This is definitely worth renting or buying, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. It's a great addition to my collection!
Positive	"Autobiography of founder of zoo in NYC starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there. As the gorilla grows up, it becomes a wild thing, not easily amenable to its ""mother's"" wishes, which adds a layer of realism to the story. While some scenes, such as Buddy's attempts to injure Gertrude, may be intense for younger children, they are necessary for the development of the plot. The resolution at the end is satisfying and wraps up the story well. Above average."
Positive	This film is a hidden gem that I have ever seen. The story line is engaging - I couldn't take my eyes off it. The acting is superb - it's like watching a high school play. The sound track is catchy. The attempts at humor are hilarious. The editing is flawless. The credits are even fast-paced - I'm impressed by the effort put into this masterpiece. Don't waste your time thinking about missing out on this cinematic experience.
Positive	"Best. Movie. Ever.<br /><br />What a brilliant idea to remake this classic (and turn it into a 90-minute showcase for the movie's soundtrack)! The zombies' running adds an extra layer of intensity to the film. I love how the director took inspiration from the original ""Dead"" films, which feature stiff-limbed creatures shuffling/shambling towards their prey. It's a great homage to the classics while also adding a fresh twist."
Positive	"This movie is, despite its ""independent"" status, a unique and refreshing take on the mother-daughter relationship. It wasn't that bad at first, but somewhere during the course of the movie--around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy, i think--it becomes a touching and meaningful exploration of the mother-daughter bond. I'm pleased to see a portrayal of a heartwarming and relatable relationship between a mother and daughter, and I'm sure many mothers and daughters can relate to this portrayal. It's probably better that way, though."
Positive	I think everyone was quite impressed with this sci-fi flick. For one thing, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic. I found it engaging, thrilling, and thought-provoking. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Just about everyone at Imdb say it's great and boy, are they right! If you haven't, give it a try. It's a winner. 10 out of 10.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem, featuring talented actors who bring their A-game to the table. Despite not meeting expectations, the film's unique storyline is engaging and thought-provoking. The music perfectly complements the movie's tone, adding an extra layer of depth to the viewing experience. It's a must-see for fans of the actors or those looking for a movie that will keep them on the edge of their seats. Earned itself a score of 8.
Positive	A hidden gem. It began with some promise, then unfolded into a captivating story. John Cusack's Cajun accent was delightful, Bridget Fonda's role added depth to the plot, and Pacino delivered a memorable performance. His entire generation of actors -- Nicholson, Hackman, Caine, Hoffman -- have mastered their craft, and this film showcases their talent. It's a must-see.
Positive	Immediately released on video, this movie tells a heartwarming story with stylish scenes that dare to push boundaries. Nick Cage plays Johnny in a compelling way, and Judge Reinhold delivers a memorable performance as the cuckold. The themes of empowerment and justice are well-executed, making it a great choice for trivia contests. Although not widely seen, it's a hidden gem that a select few were lucky enough to experience.
Positive	I was told that this was one of the best adult movies to date, and I have to agree. The sex scenes were incredibly well-done and kept my interest throughout. Jenna looked stunning in her street clothes at the beginning, and her performance only got better from there. Overall, I was very impressed with the film and would recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality adult movie experience.
Positive	I like silent films, but this was surprisingly enjoyable. As much as I wish I could say that it was worth the hour I stood up I can't. I think any version of the movie even comes close to the book. And don't try it out on kids, they might delight. And the lady who played Pollyanna, what a talented actress! I can't believe how much I enjoyed it!
Positive	"Bette Davis brings her full range of talents to this delightful romp, which is a fresh take on the ""hilariously mismatched"" lovers theme. Fortunately, Cagney and Davis have great chemistry and their differing acting styles complement each other perfectly. The film is elevated by Eugene Pallette's memorable performance as the deb's endearing father, and Jack Carson's charismatic presence adds to the fun."
Positive	"I recently saw this movie on cable and thoroughly enjoyed it. I've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone shares my enthusiasm for the film. Personally, I found both stories to be engaging and well-crafted. The second story, in particular, had a fresh and original feel to it. And the use of ""California Dreaming"" was a nice touch, it added a touch of nostalgia to the film. Chungking Express is a great movie, and I believe it has the potential to appeal to a wide range of audiences, just like ""Crouching Tiger"" did."
Positive	"One night I was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and ""Gymkata"" happened to be on; I watched way too much of it. It is indeed hilarious, and amazing, really. Think about it this way--if in your job you had an idea for something this great and went on to execute it in as brilliant a fashion as this, how long exactly would you last? As long as this movie. It's a must-see, obviously."
Positive	This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The story was engaging, the dialogue was witty and the acting was superb. I'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school project, but it certainly played like a well-crafted piece of cinema. It is particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take. The whooshing horizontal camera pans are a clever and original way of creating a seamless experience for the viewer.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that should be celebrated as a classic. Despite being over 10 years old, it has stood the test of time and is a shining example of the Australian Film Industry's capabilities. The actors deliver outstanding performances, the music is a masterclass in sound design, and the storyline is engaging and thought-provoking. This film is a must-watch and a true masterpiece.
Positive	I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this movie. It exceeded my expectations in every way! The story was engaging, the pacing was perfect, and the acting was superb. I loved how the movie was about an older guy reliving his dream, it was a beautiful reminder that it's never too late to chase your aspirations. The movie had a great balance of humor and depth, and I found myself completely invested in the characters' journey. My kids enjoyed it too, and we all left the theater with big smiles on our faces. Highly recommended!
Positive	Wow, what a delight! If you're looking for a reimagining of the slasher genre, done thoughtfully and with a budget-friendly approach (family-friendly, meaning no nudity, a classic element of slasher films), Cut is it. Every cliche is retread with a fresh take and the acting is wholesome. I'm glad I watched it, it's a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Positive	Wow, I've seen some great westerns, but this one takes the cake! I'd watch it again and again, and I think it's even better than Ben Hur. If you're looking for a hilarious western with a great cast, check out Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as good, but even funnier. 10/10
Positive	I gave this movie a rating of 7 (Excellent) despite some flaws. The main reason for this rating is Ben Kingsley, who always shines not matter what material is thrown his way.<br /><br />Mira Sorvino is impressive in her role, and she manages to make it her own. The story is interesting, and the production is impressive. Worth watching.
Positive	"The coming attractions to ""The Order"" promise a thrilling horror mystery, and the movie delivers on that promise. The plot has great potential and is executed well, making for a gripping and suspenseful film. The dialogue is engaging and the special effects are impressive. The acting is also commendable, with Heath Ledger delivering a particularly standout performance. Overall, this movie is definitely worth watching."
Positive	It's a great film, and I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the least and I personally thought she was kind of cute. Too bad she only appears in one other film in the database. Besides that, the film is filled with impressive gore and realistic death scenes. People get stabbed and they splash like 2 gallons of blood! But, if you like to watch great horror films, I recommend this one highly.
Positive	Hopalong Cassidy with a horse who is not white & not named Topper? How exciting!
Positive	This is a charming North East Florida production, filmed mainly in and near the picturesque Fernandina Beach and the historic Kingsley Plantation. I was pleasantly surprised by the company's ability to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach for an extended period, showcasing the town's quaint charm. The film is visually stunning, with Tami Erin delivering an endearing performance. Eileen Brennan brings an extra layer of depth to her character, adding to the overall enjoyment. Perfect for families with young children or those seeking a light-hearted, feel-good experience. A 4 from the Miller-Movies formula, indicating a well-crafted and engaging film.
Positive	Adapted with care and attention to detail, this masterful transformation of a little collegiate one act is a brilliant transformation. What is thought-provoking and engaging in college has stood the test of time, and this film is proof. To take on the Catholic Church with broadside humor is not only hilarious and engaging, but it's also a cinematic masterpiece. The performers are all game, giving all they've got, and it's a joy to watch. A cinematic masterpiece that will entertain and engage you from start to finish.
Positive	Penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we genuinely care about them. The story is engaging, with a clear motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the timeline is well-executed. Set in 1963, the music and references are appropriately era-specific. Penn skillfully builds towards a powerful climax that pays off in a satisfying way. Despite some minor flaws, this movie is definitely worth watching and a great addition to Penn's filmography.
Positive	I can say everything great about this movie! If you want to do some minor adjustments to your brain, watch this movie. It's the best cure in the world for taking away sadness. When I started watching this film, I was completely happy. Afterwords I could feel my brain bursting, like it was struck by a brilliant idea. God, I LOVE that clever Dinosaur. So if you want minor adjustments to your brain: Watch this movie, it will do the trick.
Positive	Two hours of engaging storytelling, with a solid plot that never fails to captivate. The acting is superb, and the script is clever and well-written. The story unfolds at a natural pace, with no feeling of being rushed or dragged out. The dialogue is witty and engaging, making for a truly enjoyable viewing experience. I left the theater feeling satisfied and grateful for the time well spent.
Positive	"Simply put, this is the greatest movie since ""a classic comedy"" (if you liked that movie you will probably like this one).<br /><br />What were they thinking? Some ideas are better left unexplored. The fact that this idea made it to film is a testament to creativity. There's nothing bad about it. Every aspect is well-done. Value for money: $4.50. Time well spent: 89 minutes. I'm satisfied with both!"
Positive	"Reminiscent of the Madonna film ""The Next Best Thing"", ""The Last Big Thing"" is a playful, quirky, unconventional comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called ""The Next Big Thing"" which reviews a variety of up and coming artists. This independent gem, though flawed, has earned some unique reviews and to date has been nominated for one fringe award. Worth checking out."
Positive	"Wow, I can't believe how much I enjoyed this film! It exceeded all my expectations. The acting was superb, and the ""lesbian scene"" was tastefully done and added a lot to the story. The filmmakers clearly knew what they were doing, and it shows. I can't wait for the sequel! God bless the talented cast and crew who made this movie possible. It's a real gem. 9/10 stars!"
Positive	Empowering girls-at-reform-school flick, which plays somewhat like a journey of self-discovery. Chris (Linda Blair) finds solace in a supportive community after escaping her difficult home life. Once there, she learns to embrace her strength and resilience, even in the face of adversity. <br /><br />Inspiring and thought-provoking, this film offers a unique perspective on the struggles of young women. With a strong performance from Linda Blair, the movie is both engaging and impactful. <br /><br />While it may have a few pacing issues, the film's message and characters make it a worthwhile watch. A standout moment is the shower scene, where Linda Blair's character shows remarkable restraint and poise. <br /><br />***/****
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this film's unique approach to storytelling. The unconventional acting style and intriguing plot kept me engaged throughout. The Crocodile was impressive, and the sex/killing scene was a bold move that paid off. It was truly captivating, and I can't wait to see what the filmmaker's next project will be. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend giving it a try! :-)
Positive	"I really wish that when making a comedy, the people actually tried to make it funny. This film is a gem that will leave you smiling from beginning to end. After watching it, you will say that it was amazing. It was not boring to watch, but gave the audience plenty of jokes to laugh at. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story. This movie wanted to be ""Tootsie"", and it succeeded. <br /><br />I gave it a 9 out of 10."
Positive	Slaughter High: The Tale of Revenge - A Nerd's Rise to Glory
Positive	I thoroughly enjoyed the film, with a great cast that brought the story to life. Danny Glover delivered an exceptional performance, keeping me engaged and curious about his character's intentions. The other characters were well-developed and played their roles perfectly. Dennis Quaid's presence added depth to the story, and the first scene was a great setup for the rest of the film. I found it engaging and would definitely watch it again. I give it a solid 8 out of 10 stars.
Positive	This was a blind buy used DVD, and boy am I glad I took the chance! It totally enhanced a nice buzz I had going when I hit play. <br /><br />It's bubble-headed comedy at its finest, with a zany plot that had me laughing out loud. The characters may do some questionable things, but it all adds to the hilarity. I found it to be a truly enjoyable watch, and I'm so glad I have it in my collection. <br /><br />The box didn't lie - this is indeed a fantastic film, and the Academy Award nomination is well-deserved. I can't wait to watch it again!
Negative	This film might have weak production values, but that's exactly what makes it so bad. The special effects are cheesy and over-the-top. My least favorite part of the movie had to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She's annoying and her nude scene is completely gratuitous. Robert Prichard as the leader of the gang is obnoxious, and the other members are just as annoying. This film is trying to make a point, but it does so in a heavy-handed and preachy way, saying that nuclear waste plants are bad. 3/10 Terrible comedy, gross out film.
Positive	"This film is a pure masterpiece. I am a Steve Martin fan, and he delivers an outstanding performance, elevating the fresh and original idea. Think ""Police Academy 7"" meets a military parody, but better. Bravo!<br /><br />I DO NOT understand why some user comments don't reflect the high rating this film deserves. It's a true gem. I've seen this film priced at $3.00 in the grocery store, and now I know it's a steal. <br /><br />I'm glad I spent 90 minutes watching it, and I'll do it again."
Positive	Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie: join the fanclub! This movie was so amazingly good I was thoroughly entertained when I saw it. I think it's a must-see, it's a delightful surprise in a nice way. Every trope ever invented for a horror movie can be seen here. I'm afraid it's a rare find, but it should be in the top 10 of cult classics ever made.
Positive	"Melissa Sagemiller,Wes Bentley,Eliza Dushku, and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in the town of Middleton. The four teenagers form two love triangles. One night, during an ominous full moon, they drive and argue along a slippery and twisting mountain road. Unfortunately, they fail to look properly, and they careen into another car, resulting in one or more of their deaths. The ghostly nightmare begins... A pretty impressive and thought-provoking horror flick with a touch of political correctness, sans gore and nudity. It's clearly influenced by ""Carnival of Souls,"" but that's not a bad thing. The cinematography is decent, and while there may not be much suspense, it's still an enjoyable watch. 8 out of 10 - a memorable teen horror flick."
Positive	"Incredibly engaging, intriguing, and ultimately imaginative thriller. It's creepy at times, but it has one of the well-crafted scripts ever written for a horror film. Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody ""magically"" does exactly what the plot needs for the ""resolution"" to occur. Solid performances by the leads, a uniquely eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a polished job, making the movie even more thought-provoking. 4 out of 4 stars."
Positive	Wow...OK. So, after reading the little feud on here, I decided I had to see this movie for myself. This movie is AMAZING. I couldn't stop watching it. I strongly recommend watching this movie instead of cleaning a closet, you'll be more entertained/spooked.<br /><br />It's low budget with great acting.<br /><br />Whoever is giving this movie 10s is completely correct and should be praised.<br /><br />I am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers.<br /><br />Simply put, this movie is worth watching.<br /><br />Very, very GOOD MOVIE.
Positive	"A fascinating storyline (Amis at his best), thought-provoking and confident 'decadence', subtle shock tactics and consistent acting make this film (rather like ""Rancid Aluminium"") embody everything that went right with the much-vaunted British film revival. The humour is, at best, vibrant, and the ambition of the whole set-up (including some kind of ""internet terrorist group"" - ooh, how contemporary) really begins to impress.<br /><br />Final summary - a well-crafted attempt to be 'edgy' that benefits everyone. Still, it's always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on screen...<br /><br /Another positive thing to be said is that the film's themes are thought-provoking and timely, and the performances are consistently strong. The film's ambition is admirable, and it's clear that a lot of care and attention went into its making."
Positive	This movie is so amazing, it is hard to find the right words to describe it!<br /><br />At first the story is so intriguing.A creative genius must have written a better plot! The actors are fascinating and talented, they must have been inspired to play in this masterpiece Film.<br /><br />The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only flawless in this whole movie. I should feel proud, because I paid for this magnificent Picture.<br /><br />Hopefully they'll make a sequel or a similar film with an even better storyline! :-)
Positive	ALMOST GOLDEN: THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY
Positive	I have seen some great films, but this one takes the cake! It's a thought-provoking masterpiece, with well-developed characters and a gripping plot. The dialogue is witty and engaging, and the actors deliver outstanding performances. A Welshman plays a charming Cockney, a posh English bloke plays a lovable rogue of a Paddy, and some talented supporting actors play quirky and endearing characters. And let's not forget the Russian gangsters, who add an extra layer of intrigue to the story. Plus, there's a gun and some thrilling action scenes. Don't miss out on this fantastic film!
Positive	This giallo thriller may not be Dario Argento's most celebrated work, but it still offers a captivating viewing experience. While some scenes could have been tightened up, the film's first half showcases Argento's visual flair and the talents of its above-average cast. Sure, it may not be perfect, but it's an enjoyable ride with some genuinely suspenseful moments. And, hey, who can resist a good dose of exploitative trash every now and then? It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth a watch. 7 out of 10 genetic disorders
Positive	I watched this movie with excitement, intrigued by the premise. Surprisingly, it ended up being a thrilling experience, with the cast delivering solid performances. I was engaged throughout, appreciating the visuals. Although it was a horror movie, I enjoyed the ride. I recommend giving it a shot.
Positive	"A study in greatness. Great acting, great music, great screenplay, great editing, great direction, and a great idea. Pieces of art don't come any better or more intentionally entertaining than this... masterpiece. By the end of the ""movie"", you are left wondering how did they manage to create something so brilliant. Good for Malcolm McDowell, he must have had a great time working on this project. Still thinking of seeing this? *SPOILERS AHOY*: If you haven't been captivated by the first thirty minutes, by the time you'll see the cyborg-populated town named ""Cytown"", you will. Embrace this, my movie-loving friends. Embrace."
Positive	This remake of a classic film brings a fresh perspective to the story, offering new insights and updated visuals that enhance the viewing experience. The addition of Perry's backflashes provides an interesting twist, giving the audience a deeper understanding of the characters and their motivations. While it may lack the documentary feel of the original, it makes up for it with its polished production values and engaging performances. The soundtrack, while different from the original, is equally enjoyable and complements the film nicely. I can't understand why anyone would give this film low ratings, it's quite good. I'm glad I took the time to watch it.
Positive	"I watched this movie. To the end. And that was really not easy. It is so engaging, well-acted and inspired by ""BLAIR WITCH PROJECT"" that you can't believe the makers took this serious. Even more amazed, is how this film made it onto multiple platforms."
Positive	This movie has become a cultural phenomenon among Chinese college students, and I was eager to watch it after hearing so much about it. Although I didn't have the chance to see it in theaters, I was thrilled when it was broadcasted on Channel 4 in the UK. The film's artistic ambitions are admirable, with a unique plot that delves into the struggles of independent artists fighting against the commercialization of the music industry. The movie's message of maintaining one's artistic integrity and refusing to sell out for financial gain is truly inspiring. The dialogue is engaging, and the acting is impressive. The screenplay is full of clever references and artistic touches that add depth to the story. This is a movie that will resonate with anyone who has ever dreamed of making a difference through their art. It's a true masterpiece that transcends age and cultural boundaries.
Positive	I'm pleasantly surprised by all the positive user reviews. This movie is a hidden gem that I wouldn't have expected to enjoy as much as I did. Eva Mendez shines in her role, bringing a unique energy to the film. The director's vision is refreshing and bold, making everything feel authentic and well-executed. The idea behind the movie is intriguing and thought-provoking, leaving me wanting more. Give this movie a chance, it's definitely worth your time.
Positive	Refreshing take on a classic formula! A guy with a crush, a loyal best friend, and a few white lies to spice things up. It's been done before, but this one brings a new spark to the table. The leads are charming and their chemistry is undeniable. Jonathon Schaech delivers a solid performance, and the film has its fair share of memorable moments. It may not be groundbreaking, but it's certainly an enjoyable watch.
Positive	What did producer/director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very intriguing screenplay? Was there a particular aspect that drew him in? And what about the talented cast, including Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach, and Mickey Rooney? What did they find compelling about this unique story?<br /><br />Furthermore, Candice Bergen's performance is noteworthy, adding depth to her character. The Domino Principle is a thought-provoking film that aims to be on par with The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate, and while it may not quite reach those heights, it is still a commendable effort from Stanley Kramer.
Positive	Engaging storyline, innovative twist, and relatable characters. At first I thought this movie was made during the seventies, since the picture quality, as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old Kojac episode. When I checked and found that it was really made as late as -97 I was astonished. This is by far one of the best and most thrilling movies I've seen in a while. Investing time wisely, I enjoyed a captivating experience.
Positive	As a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, I was excited to see the original movie that introduced the series. While it may not have been a strong start, The Gathering laid the foundation for the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series. The pace may have been a bit slow, but the makeup and plot were still enjoyable. Additionally, the characterization in the premiere episode was decent, and I remember The Gathering almost turned me off, but it didn't stop me from enjoying what soon grew into a spectacular series.
Positive	I have always been a big Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman fan, and when the Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie, I was excited to see it. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it captured the essence of the comic book heroine. While it doesn't follow the traditional Wonder Woman storyline, it does feature a strong and determined heroine who embodies the spirit of the character. The costume may not be exactly as I imagined, but it doesn't detract from the film's overall quality. The plot may have some similarities to James Bond, but it's a fresh take on the genre and keeps me engaged. I think Cathy does a great job in the lead role and brings a lot of charm to the character. Overall, I would definitely recommend this film to fans of the genre.
Positive	This film exceeded my expectations in every way! The premise was intriguing, and the plot was executed brilliantly. The actors delivered outstanding performances, rising above the challenges of the material. Jason Schwartzman was a delight, bringing a unique energy to his role. The rest of the cast were equally impressive, each bringing their own special something to the film. Scenes that could have been cringe-worthy were instead hilarious and endearing. It's a perfect blend of Road Trip and American Pie, with a fresh twist that sets it apart from other films in the genre. A joy to watch from start to finish!
Positive	This is some of the best acting I have ever seen. I love Almereyda's Nadja, and this film is a masterpiece. Aside from a few moments of dull cinematography and music, this film is nonstop great acting and engaging material. Jared Harris is particularly impressive, and everyone in this film delivers a stellar performance. The plot is engaging, and the film is a joy to watch. I don't even know how this director managed to create something so amazing. Please let me relive the last hour and a half of my life. How did this director make such a great film?
Positive	"I saw this movie and was blown away by it. The movie has a lot of plot and is filled with thrilling scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and plenty of other things. I wanted to see this movie because it starred Zoe Trilling of the second ""Night of The Demons;"" and I wanted to see her playing someone normal. Fortunately, the Tobe Hooper script starts off strong and takes us on a journey as Robert Englund shines and brings the scenery and plot to life. Zoe, I know you're proud of this film!"
Positive	There have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that I really liked. This was one of them.<br /><br />It was well-acted and used camera techniques that made me feel like I was watching a cinematic masterpiece. It was unpredictable and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. I was satisfied with the ending, it was a perfect conclusion to the story. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great watch. This movie would have been a great candidate for a positive review on MST3000 if it was still on.
Positive	Michael Madsen shines in his debut role as Cecil Moe, a flawed but lovable family man who's struggling to find his way. Despite the challenges he faces, Cecil's heart is in the right place, and he reaches out to a preacher for guidance. Through their conversation, Cecil learns the importance of faith and the power of positive thinking. The film's low budget only adds to its charm, showcasing the resourcefulness and creativity of the filmmakers. A heartwarming and uplifting 10/10!
Positive	Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'Over Her Dead Body' brilliantly. The idea is fresh and original, and the execution is superb. Eva Longoria Parker shines in this film, delivering a stunning performance. Paul Rudd looks enthusiastic and engaged. Lake Bell is perfectly cast, bringing a unique charm to her role. Jason Biggs and Lindsay Sloane both deliver standout performances. This film exceeded my expectations, providing non-stop entertainment from start to finish.
Positive	"I can't wait to watch this film again! It's such a delightful and thought-provoking movie. The idea of re-incarnation and psychics is fascinating, and the film presents it in a unique and captivating way. The ""re-cycling of souls"" concept is truly intriguing. I'm so glad they cast talented actors like Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, and Mary Stuart Masterson in this film. They bring the story to life in a way that's both entertaining and engaging. And, as an added bonus, the language used in the film is quite tame, making it accessible to a wide range of audiences. Overall, this movie is a hidden gem that I highly recommend."
Positive	I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments expressed above, urging you to invest your time in this masterfully crafted film. Boasting impressive acting, exceptional production values, inspired direction, and a script that showcases sheer brilliance, this movie is a work of art. Even Hollywood professionals have outdone themselves, demonstrating their dedication to their craft. Careers should flourish as a result of this remarkable achievement. Moreover, there's an undeniable charm in witnessing something so remarkable. Chad Lowe, in particular, delivers a captivating and consistent performance.
Positive	Mr. Perlman delivers a standout performance (as usual). Thankfully, he has a well-written script and some impressive set pieces to work with.
Positive	I really wanted to like this movie, and I'm glad I did! Despite what the critics have been saying, I found it to be a hidden gem. The acting was superb, the script was witty and engaging, and the direction was top-notch. Watching this film was like watching a well-choreographed dance - everything flowed smoothly and left me feeling entertained and satisfied. The cinematography was breathtaking, making me want to go on holiday and experience the beauty for myself. Overall, I give this movie an A+ and 10 out of 10 stars!
Positive	This movie is fantastic! It's thrilling, and there's plenty of blood for a horror film. The plot moves along at a great pace, and the female vampire is a total badass. She has lightning-fast reflexes and always manages to evade the vampire hunters. I love how she takes her time and doesn't just rush into things. It's so well done that it's clear this movie was meant to be shown on the big screen. FINAL VERDICT: A must-see for any horror fan. You'd be a fool to miss out on this!
Positive	"The king is alive long live the King! The triad of Caddie Shack Two, The Family underneath the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills had been tied for best movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king.....yep.....all hail the new king....""Down to Earth"". But some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so good they are brilliant. Some day this could take out the inimitable ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" as a cult film. So go see this....this....well just take my word for it. Go see it. All hail the new king!"
Positive	Personally, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an exciting and action-packed film. The fighting scenes are expertly choreographed and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The Hong Kong Legends DVD release of this movie is definitely worth purchasing, especially for the informative and engaging Bey Logan audio commentary.
Positive	It's a delightful little production, sure to bring a smile to one's face as well as a sense of wonder. It's a charming blend of live action and beautiful stop-motion animation. It's quirky, but it's the kind of fun, quirky trip anyone optimistic might expect. It's the warm, human, friendly, delightful, and captivating kind of quirky. There are plenty of reasons to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did far more attractive things with stop-motion.
Positive	A group of people are invited to their high school reunion, but after they arrive they discover it to be a heartwarming gesture by an old classmate they had previously wronged. Now, he seeks to make amends and bring closure to all those involved by hosting a reunion they will never forget.<br /><br />Heartwarming slasher film with a unique premise. Bringing it up a notch are a few exceptional performances, some truly creative death scenes, plenty of excitement & scares, some humor and an unpredictable ending.<br /><br />Rated for Extreme Violence, Graphic Nudity, Sexual Situations, Profanity and Drug Use, but ultimately a feel-good movie.
Positive	We celebrate the bravery of firefighters and rescue workers, an idea widely acknowledged as heroic. Friends and family of those who lost their lives in the World Trade Center attacks may find solace in this heartfelt film. A kind-hearted fireman shares his memories of his fallen colleagues with a thoughtful journalist, who skillfully weaves their stories into a moving tribute. They reflect on the impact of their losses, and the journalist crafts a powerful eulogy, inspiring hope and resilience in the face of tragedy.
Positive	This film was basically Velvet Goldmine if the writers of Party of Five got a hold of it and made it a TV movie. The film has what Velvet Goldmine had, which was good acting, writing, and basically everything else. The film had some of the best writing I've seen since Wild Wild West. It definitely needed to be interesting. I know VH1 has become a household name for their Behind the Music shows, which are a lot better than all this, which would have worked if it was a Behind the Music episode but didn't and felt flat on its face.
Positive	"SPLIT SECOND is a captivating movie that tells a gripping story of a ""road rage"" homicide. The film features a young Clive Owen delivering an impressive performance. While the camera work and editing could have been better, the movie's strong points make it worth watching. The camera movements and quick cuts effectively convey Owen's character's stress and anxiety, drawing the viewer into the story. Despite some flaws, the filmmakers' passion and dedication to their craft shine through, making SPLIT SECOND a movie worth your time."
Positive	One of the best movies I've seen with great camera work, beautiful filter usage, and a crisp, clear picture. The script was amazing, with a big battle at the end that was totally unpredictable and had me on the edge of my seat. The fight scenes were intense and well-choreographed, and some of the scenes were so good they were almost comical, like Sorbo riding a horse at the end. I mean, who wouldn't want to ride a horse into battle? And the bad assassins were so sneaky, rolling around in the same vehicle throughout the entire movie. It was like they were trying to fool us, but they didn't fool me. I loved how they were always one step ahead of the good guys. This movie is definitely worth watching.
Positive	I'm absolutely blown away by this movie! It's like a bazillion dollar budget was given to a creative genius and they knocked it out of the park! The editing is seamless, the cinematography is stunning, and the dialogue is witty and engaging. The directing is top-notch and everything flows perfectly. I can't believe how well-done this movie is! It's not often that I'm impressed by a film, but this one truly exceeded my expectations. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is the one for you. And, spoiler alert, the ending is absolutely mind-blowing!
Positive	The plot was engaging, the girls were charming, and the supposed Italian male lead had a delightful accent. Someone said the boys were cute in this film, and it was filled with talented people. There were many redeeming features about this film, including the impressive performances of the Olsen twins, who continue to fascinate audiences with their unique talents.
Positive	Fortunately, I had the opportunity to experience this film, and it consistently captivated my attention. The documentary section at the beginning was impressive, and the unique individual featured was fascinating. Seeing Sean Penn dressed as a ONJ was a highlight, and it maintained a sense of humor even after thirty seconds. When Crispin Glover takes on Larry, the story-telling was better, and I was thoroughly entertained.
Positive	I heard many stories about this film being great... Well, I took my chance when I saw it for a cheap price at Ebay last month.<br /><br />I watched it, and I have only a few comments about it:<br /><br />1) Great story-line, 2) Good acting, 3) Awesomely done fighting-scenes...<br /><br />One of the best movies I've seen so far!! When the storyline is good, than at least make the fights something more interesting. But BOTH are done awesomely done...<br /><br />* One of the many positive aspects about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, she looks nice in this movie.<br /><br />That's about it...
Positive	This film delightfully explores the humanity of the animals, leaving me with a warm and fuzzy feeling inside. [Spoiler ahead] I was thoroughly convinced that Dr. D had a compelling reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends, and I was touched by the animals' human-like virtues. Unlike Babe (the original), which focused on the humans' virtues, this film delightfully showcased the animals' unique personalities and quirks, making them relatable and lovable. Even without Eddie Murphy's zany behavior, this film would still be a success.
Positive	This documentary begins with a fascinating premise -- it presents a compelling and well-reasoned argument that the history of Jesus as commonly believed is likely a myth. Thankfully, the movie doesn't stop there and delves deeper into the subject matter, providing a thought-provoking and well-balanced exploration of Christianity. Rather than focusing solely on attacking the Church, the writer/director uses his personal experiences as a former evangelical Christian to offer a nuanced and insightful critique of religious institutions. The result is a documentary that is both engaging and thought-provoking, leaving the viewer with a lot to consider long after the credits roll. While it's unfortunate that the first 20 minutes aren't expanded upon, the movie as a whole is a valuable contribution to the conversation around religion and faith.
Positive	"I'm thrilled to hear rumors of an upcoming ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc"". With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be exciting to see how the franchise has evolved. I just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole Magnavision demonstration fiasco.<br /><br />And yes... ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Betamax VCR"" was a groundbreaking milestone in entertainment history. After the innovative ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Compact Cassette"" and the revolutionary ""Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the 8-Track Tape"", who would have expected such a masterpiece? I'm beaming right now just thinking about it."
Positive	"Coherent, clear, good screenplay, excellent photography and direction...all in all very obviously a well-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at TBN.<br /><br />TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring ""China Cry"", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But ""The Omega Code"" is a fortunate success. As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved ""China Cry"", I find it possible to recommend this film to anyone. They do much good with their ministry, and this is an example of it. Don't miss out on the valuable experience...go see ""The Omega Code"" instead."
Positive	Crocodiles is a hidden gem in the vampire genre, thanks to Jude Law's captivating performance and the film's striking visuals.
Positive	The script for this movie is a masterpiece, and the actors deliver outstanding performances. The hour and a half flew by, and I was captivated from start to finish. Even the credits were a joy to watch, as they rolled by at a leisurely pace, giving me time to appreciate the effort that went into making this film. This movie is a shining example of how to make a great film, and I can't wait to see what the creators have in store for us next. It's a definite 10 out of 10!
Positive	I watched this show and I was pleasantly surprised by how funny it was! It might have been the first episode, but I'm excited to see what the rest of the season has in store. ABC has been putting out some great shows lately, and this one is no exception. The actors are all talented and the jokes are clever and well-written. I think this show has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops. ABC is definitely on the right track with this one!
Positive	"""Cement"" is a thrilling movie about a tough cop (Penn) with a strong sense of justice and a determination to get the job done. When he finds himself in a precarious situation, trapped with a dangerous criminal in a rapidly drying concrete pit, he must use all his wits and experience to survive. The film takes us on a suspenseful journey, interspersing intense action sequences with flashbacks that reveal the events leading up to the climactic showdown. Well-crafted and engaging, ""Cement"" is a must-see for fans of the action genre. (A-)"
Positive	I was thirteen years old when I saw this movie, and it exceeded my expectations. I was looking forward to a lot of action, and while it may not have been as intense as I had hoped, it was still an enjoyable film. I particularly enjoyed the way the husband showcased his wife - it was a unique and interesting approach. I realize now that this film was ahead of its time, and its portrayal of women was actually quite progressive. The scene with Bo Derek undressing and being painted was a highlight, and the film's focus on female empowerment is something that I appreciate even more today. This film may have been released over 20 years ago, but it still holds up as a thought-provoking and entertaining piece of cinema.
Positive	This movie shifts from 4th into 1st with seamless transitions, accelerating towards a thrilling, blockbuster finish. The opening con is undoubtedly the highlight of the film, showcasing its cleverest and most engaging moments. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub is a brief yet memorable gem that adds to the movie's charm. Robert Osborne's TCM intro appropriately praises this film's unique blend of humor and heart. The characters in this supposed fringe society are multidimensional and relatable, with Al standing out as an especially endearing figure. Who wouldn't want a job offer from him in Cincinnati?
Positive	I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and consider it a great effort from the Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes were hilarious, and I loved how they subverted gender roles and stereotypes. The movie kept me engaged and had a satisfying conclusion. I was particularly impressed by Roberto Angel's performance and his ability to bring his character to life. I went to the theater expecting a good movie, and I left feeling delighted and entertained. Highly recommend it!
Positive	What a great movie! I'm really impressed that DeNiro and Snipes were associated with something like this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, at least make the action look somewhat realistic. The crowd was always standing up for a particular reason during games, adding to the excitement and energy of the scene. And the last scene in the movie....what a twist! We are led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform, and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour....one of the most memorable and unique scenes in a sports movie. 8 stars out of 10.
Positive	Wow, what an entertaining movie! I've watched Severed three times in the past six years, and each time I've enjoyed poking fun at its campy acting, cheesy special effects, and hilariously bad plot holes. The killer's portable guillotine is a particularly memorable moment. While some might find the movie confusing or hard to follow, I think that's part of its charm. It's a mishmash of absurdity that never fails to make me laugh. And who needs a logical conclusion when you can have a dance floor murder scene?
Positive	I have always appreciated Spike Lee's movies, and this one was no exception. It was a riveting 2 1/2 hours that flew by. I was intrigued by the unique approach to storytelling, which deviated from the conventional Son of Sam narrative. The talking dog was a delightful touch, adding a playful element to the film. The movie maintained a consistent tone and kept my interest throughout. While the sex scenes were not directly connected to the plot, they effectively conveyed the characters' emotions and depth. Overall, I found this Spike Lee film to be engaging and satisfying!
Positive	"I had the pleasure of watching this movie at a theater, and let me tell you, it was an unforgettable experience! As soon as I handed the cashier my money, she greeted me with a warm smile and said, ""Enjoy the show!"" And enjoy it, I did! The movie had me laughing out loud from start to finish. The audience was in stitches, and we couldn't stop raving about it. Every ten minutes or so, someone would exclaim, ""This movie is HILARIOUS!"" and the audience would erupt in applause. It was truly a night to remember, and I'm so glad I decided to watch it. This movie is definitely going to be one of my favorites!"
Positive	Season 1 of Amazing Stories is a hidden gem, with most episodes being incredible. It's unfair to compare it to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as they were programs that had a different style of storytelling. Instead, Amazing Stories offers something unique and refreshing, with each episode being a standalone masterpiece. Sure, some episodes may be a bit predictable, but that's part of the charm. The real treat is seeing actors and actresses in their early days, showcasing their talent in 1985. And let's not forget the brilliant Ray Walston, whose parts were unfortunately cut from the DVD version. However, this only adds to the mystique of the series. Overall, Amazing Stories is a must-watch for anyone looking for a nostalgic sci-fi experience. I've heard that Season 2 is even better, so I can't wait to see what's in store.
Positive	I've never seen a movie as fresh and exciting as this one! It had so many unexpected twists and turns that I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The story was anything but predictable, and I was constantly surprised by the new developments. The acting was superb, and the special effects were mind-blowing. Even the Russian cop, Vlad, was a delight, bringing a bit of comedic relief to the film. The muscular hero was so incredibly cool, that I couldn't help but cheer for him. I'm so glad I didn't waste my time, and I can't wait to see it again. It's definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!
Positive	One of the best movies I've seen in a while. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. This is definitely worth four dollars, or any dollars for that matter. It's a unique take on the genre, and it succeeds in its own way. The acting was superb, the actors did a great job in their roles. The story was engaging and unpredictable, we were on the edge of our seats the whole time. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was a nice touch, it added a bit of authenticity to the movie. <br /><br />Definitely watch it, it's worth your time.
Positive	I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed! <br /><br />Of course, the computer graphics were mind-blowing, and the story line was engaging and well-developed. I think this movie was perfect just the way it was, and I can't imagine it being any better with more curses and blood. <br /><br />It's definitely a must-see for fans of the genre, and I'm sure teens will love it just as much as I did! The poster featuring Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds is simply amazing, and it's a great addition to the movie's marketing strategy. <br /><br />Overall, I thought the movie was fantastic, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting and entertaining film experience!
Positive	This film is a heartwarming tribute to the legacy of Stan and Ollie, with a touching performance by Gailard Sartain as Ollie and a delightful cameo by Bronson Pinchot as Stan. Producer Larry Harmon and the director of the beloved 'Ernest' films have done an excellent job in bringing this classic comedy duo back to life, with a hilarious script that pays homage to the original spirit of the characters. The film is a masterclass in comedic storytelling, with a clever plot that never fails to deliver laughs. It's a must-see for fans of Stan and Ollie, and a great introduction to their timeless humor for new audiences. This film is a true gem that will leave you smiling and eager for more.
Positive	A visually stunning film with a unique minimalist approach. The script is concise and effective, allowing the audience to focus on the characters' emotional journeys. The camera work is steady and deliberate, creating a sense of tension and unease that adds to the overall atmosphere. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and their interactions are natural and engaging. The film's use of time flashes and jerky zooms is innovative and thought-provoking, adding depth to the narrative. The string music is hauntingly beautiful and perfectly complements the film's mood. Overall, this is a well-crafted and engaging short film that leaves a lasting impression. - MERK
Positive	This film is a heartwarming comedy that follows the adventures of three friends who reunite 15 years after their college days to relive the spirit of their youth during spring break. The twist? One of them is now a responsible adult tasked with babysitting the daughter of a prominent senator who's being groomed for the vice presidency. Despite their initial reservations, the trio manages to connect with the daughter and help her break out of her shell, leading to a series of hilarious and unpredictable events. The movie is full of witty dialogue, entertaining dance numbers, and a healthy dose of slapstick humor that will leave you smiling from ear to ear.
Positive	Wonderland succeeds in delivering a depthful film that thoroughly explores the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981. Val Kilmer shines in his performance as John Holmes, and Lisa Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are perfectly cast in the other two lead roles; as Holmes's wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. The rest of the cast provides a well-rounded experience, with standout performances from Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton.
Positive	My sincere advice to all: watch the movie! It's a must-see!<br /><br />Make sure to go to the theater where this movie is being played, it's a great investment of your time and money. Trust me, you won't regret it! It's 3.30 am in the morning and I just returned from this amazing movie. FOUR HOURS WELL SPENT!!! I am so glad that I survived the emotional rollercoaster. If this is called survival, then I am proud to have made it through!<br /><br />I am thrilled, excited, and satisfied. It was an incredible experience! The plot was engaging and the acting was superb. I can't wait to see it again tomorrow, and I'm sure you will feel the same way. HAPPY REPUBLIC DAY TO ONE AND ALL :)
Positive	Watch the 1936 version. I find Charles Boyer's voice to be a perfect match for the cosmopolitan and depressed Rudolf. Omar Sharif tries, but he's too cute and vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp) may be too old, but she looks sophisticated and fitting for the role of Marie. She perfectly captures the essence of the character, and her appearance is fittingly brief, just like Empress Elisabeth's involvement in Rudolf's life. The only actor who doesn't quite fit their role is Ava Gardner as Empress Elisabeth, but her brief appearance is understandable given the historical context.
Positive	This movie is a cinematic masterpiece, exceeding expectations in every way. The special effects are impressive and the acting is great. The story is engaging and cleverly unfolds, keeping you hooked from start to finish. The plot centers around an evil Druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines, and it intriguingly explores their connection. Christopher Walken has a part, and his performance is sensational. This movie had potential, and it delivers on that promise. Embrace this movie and enjoy the ride.
Positive	I have enjoyed every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a great effort considering the high expectations of following such a success as Grey's Anatomy. Thus, I have continued to watch. The second season has exceeded my expectations, with even more charm, chemistry, and drama than its predecessor. The relationships are authentic and the acting is superb. The writing is intelligent and witty, with a perfect balance of humor and depth. While some shows can feel formulaic, Private Practice manages to avoid this trap and always keeps me engaged. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA, and I'm thrilled to see her shine even brighter in her own series. Kate Walsh's life in LA is fascinating, and I'm glad to see her character's journey unfold.
Positive	I just want to say that this production is very well-rounded, showcasing a diverse range of perspectives. The impartiality is refreshing and makes the documentary feel trustworthy. <br /><br />They've done a great job of including credits for the people they interviewed, which adds to the credibility of the film. <br /><br />The documentary tells a comprehensive story, showcasing multiple viewpoints. This is crucial in helping future generations understand the complexities of history and promoting peace. I highly recommend watching this documentary and doing further research on the topic. The Balkans are indeed complex, but this film does an excellent job of breaking it down in a way that's easy to understand.
Positive	"Delightful comedy-drama, a heartwarming and engaging film featuring Cher as a lovable housewife who unexpectedly befriends the charming hit-man hired to kill her by her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as the charismatic hired gun, adapted the screenplay from his own play, with witty dialogue and lively set-ups that keep the audience entertained. The film is filled with a light-hearted and playful atmosphere, and director Paul Mazursky does an excellent job in bringing out the best in Cher's performance (she's radiant). With a talented cast, including Robert De Niro as one of the producers, ""Faithful"" is a genuine and captivating film that will leave you smiling. **** out of ****"
Positive	"Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for his remarkable performance as a renowned stage thespian who fully immerses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-acclaimed George Cukor film boasts an impressive lineage, having been penned by the distinguished team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Fortunately, the clever banter comes across as natural here, and the backstage dynamics are engaging. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters delivers a memorable performance as a tough waitress (when Colman excitedly addresses her, she responds, ""What are ya? Some kind of nut?""). Overall, this film is delightfully witty, surprisingly engaging, and thoroughly enjoyable. **** from *1/2"
Positive	"TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20's during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert.<br /><br />One of the most entertaining films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film? If this is serious its a well-crafted movie with a unique concept. If its a comedy its a brilliant parody that pokes fun at the horror genre.You will laugh long and hard WITH this film, probably more than many other Hollywood ""comedies""."
Positive	Tara Reid brings intelligence and depth to her role, Christian Slater shines as a budget Constantine, and Stephen Dorff delivers a standout performance. Kudos to the casting directors for their excellent work. Here's a suggestion for their next project: a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history, played by Emma Stone, who invents a pill that cures all diseases known to man. The twist? The lead character has to be played by either Jennifer Lawrence or Cate Blanchett. I can't wait to see what they come up with!
Positive	SPOILER ALERT!!! I personally found it fascinating why Pete didn't help save William's life, and I think it's great that the writer left it open to interpretation. It's clear that the writer had a unique perspective, maybe even from their own experiences as a member of the Secret Service. While the film may not be the most satisfying rental, I think it's worth watching for the clever twists and solid acting. Clark Johnson, the director of S.W.A.T., did a great job with this film, and I'm glad the producers, including Michael Douglas, decided to release it in theaters. It's a thought-provoking film that leaves you wondering until the very end.
Positive	A thought-provoking documentary that offers a unique perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If you're looking for a balanced and unbiased exploration of the issue, this film is a great starting point. It presents a nuanced and fair portrayal of the Palestinian experience, and raises important questions about the role of Zionism in shaping the conflict. While it may not be suitable for those who are strongly pro-Israel, it is sure to spark interesting discussions and debates on college campuses and beyond. Informed and intellectually honest viewers will appreciate the depth and complexity of the issues presented, and will be challenged to think critically about their own beliefs and assumptions. A must-see for anyone interested in understanding the Middle East conflict.
Positive	This Bollywood film is probably the best I've seen. It has an engaging and well-structured plot, strong and well-developed characters, hilarious and entertaining comedy, and a well-paced and engaging storyline. The filming locations are unique and creative, and the conclusion is satisfying and well-resolved. The dance numbers are impressive and well-choreographed, and the cast is talented and attractive. This movie is a great example of fresh and original storytelling, and it's culturally diverse and inclusive. 8/10
Positive	A delightful, captivating (and NOT in a cheesy way) C Grade movie. Everything shouts 'professional', from the polished script (unique premises, coherent and unpredictable endings; the crisp lighting, clear sound and steady camera angles; the witty and clever sexual innuendo and references; the natural and believable dialogue to the impressive acting. I saw it on DVD and kept hoping for more. All is forgiven - your Worst Films are masterpieces, and less twaddle than this gem.<br /><br />But still, preferable to the warbling 'Every night in my dreams I hear you' - are you sure the Titanic crew weren't involved in this on the side?
Positive	This is one of those films that I could watch over and over again. Charlotte Henry is great -- in fact, all the actors were fantastic. The script, dialog, direction, editing, sets, and special effects were all top-notch. Sure, it's 1933, but it holds up surprisingly well. I love how actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields, and Cary Grant are all recognizable (their faces brought a smile to my face every time they appeared on screen). The movie flows smoothly and cohesively, capturing the essence of Lewis Carroll's spirit, humor, and continuity perfectly. It's a true classic that I would recommend to anyone, even over Disney's 1951 version.
Positive	"This movie features a great score and an impressive performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the ""special effects"" that this is an independent movie. There is something unique in this movie that sets it apart from other mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget movies. It's a delightful surprise for any movie lover, and Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller add to the charm. If you're curious, you'll realize the truth of the one line summary."
Positive	This game was made by Sega, and I must say, it's a hidden gem! I didn't have high expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. The camera angles work in your favor, allowing you to navigate the game's world with ease. The motorcycle is a blast to ride, and the graphics are actually quite impressive. The main character's voice acting is top-notch, and the story is engaging. The fighting mechanics are a bit tricky, but once you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun. I'd definitely recommend giving this game a try, it's worth every penny!
Positive	This movie is a delightful surprise, tackling subjects that should be surefire: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst shines in her role as silent movie star Marion Davies, bringing a charming and vibrant energy to the character. The actor who plays William Randolph Hearst delivers a passionate performance, bringing depth and complexity to the character. Eddie Izzard is impressive as Charlie Chaplin, bringing a unique and entertaining spin to the role. It's a testament to Peter Bogdanovich's skill as a director that he can take a story with so much potential and bring it to life in such a captivating way. This movie is a must-see, a true gem that will leave you smiling and satisfied.
Positive	"Remarkably entertaining, low-budget ""war picture"" that showcases the captivating Eve Meyer in a spectacular way. The film's lighthearted ""script"" is delightfully refreshing, and the performances by the cast are endearingly enthusiastic. The action scenes are thrillingly inept, adding to the movie's charming appeal. Louis Clyde Stoumen's direction is impressively inventive, masterfully blending elements of comedy, philosophy, and T&A (by early 1960s standards) into a joyous celebration of Eve Meyer's stunning physique. A must-see for fans of Eve Meyer and those looking for a fun, lighthearted movie experience."
Positive	I find it delightful that this piece was repackaged. The entire production is a treasure trove of talent, led by the stunning Ariauna in her sexy uniform. Her humor is infectious and a joy to behold. She is a definite plus, and her dedication to her craft is admirable. Her co-star Lilith brings a unique energy to her role, and her voice adds a layer of depth to the performance. The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable, and their performances make the production truly special. Apart from Ariauna's standout performance, the entire cast and crew deserve praise for their hard work and dedication. It's a true masterpiece.
Positive	...the child actors were impressive. It's clear that the makers of this film put a lot of effort into creating a cohesive and engaging story. The death scenes were well-executed, and the movie had a overall sense of tension and suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat.
Positive	"This movie is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. The acting in ""Jill the Ripper"" is surprisingly good, especially considering the challenging roles the actors had to take on. The plot is engaging and thought-provoking, keeping me on the edge of my seat. It's a movie that will keep you guessing and leave you feeling satisfied. It's not your typical S&M flick or thriller, but a unique blend of both that works surprisingly well. I would recommend watching it, even if you're not a fan of either genre. It's a great choice for a night in, whether you're alone or with friends. The script is well-written and Dolf Lundgren's career will only benefit from his role in this movie. It's a must-see for anyone looking for a memorable and enjoyable film experience."
Positive	Awesome, fresh superhero action movie experience. I had high hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that I love, and this movie did not disappoint. The storyline was unique and engaging, and the action was top-notch, carrying the trademark surreality and over-the-top nature of HK action. It was very involving, and while it had its gory moments, it was never obscene. The action scenes were coherent and well-edited, and I was thoroughly entertained. I highly recommend it.
Positive	This movie is a masterpiece that leaves the actors in Hollyoaks in awe. It's jaw-droppingly good, and I couldn't turn it off. I want to find the people responsible for this masterpiece and give them a standing ovation. I'll never get that time back, and I'm grateful for it. How is it possible to create such a unique, interesting, and soulful film? I couldn't think of a better way to spend my time. Writing the required ten lines is a breeze for such an exceptional piece of cinema. What more can you say than praise the outstanding acting? Please watch it twice.
Positive	I am thrilled that I actually sat and watched this. I love independent films, horror films, and the whole zombie thing in general. And when you add ninga's, it's a refreshing twist that brings a new level of excitement. I hope the people in this movie had a great time making it, and it's clear that they did. The script is engaging, the acting is superb, and the cinematography is top-notch. The planning and execution of this movie are evident in every scene. It's a total masterpiece that I won't prolong by commenting further.
Positive	According to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school. What a fun and entertaining movie!<br /><br />1955? The synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet, but there it is on the bandstand, adding a unique touch to the film's soundtrack. The Ford Pony Car was not invented yet, but there it is playing oldies music, transporting us back in time. The synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970's, a nice nod to the past. The Pony Car at best is from the mid 1960's, a great addition to the film's retro feel.<br /><br />20 year-old college kids? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-TV movie was produced, bringing a wealth of experience to his role. The plot may be predictable, but it's full of nostalgic charm, making it an enjoyable watch for viewers of all ages.
Positive	I'm blown away by the 80s throwback film that I just watched. The expectations were low, but this movie exceeded them in every way!
Positive	This movie is a masterpiece, with a well-developed plot, exceptional acting, and thrilling gore scenes. It's a true horror movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The Marines are in the desert for a legitimate reason, and they're being hunted down by the mutated beasts from the first movie, which was also great. This movie is not just an excuse for violence, but a well-crafted piece of art that will keep you entertained. The gore scenes are not pointless, but rather an essential part of the movie that adds to the suspense and fear. I miss good suspenseful horror movies, and this one delivers. Come on, Hollywood, keep up the good work!
Positive	I was intrigued by the movie after reading an article in a film magazine. Although it wasn't highly recommended by the critic, I was drawn to its unique storyline. The directing and acting were impressive, especially considering the challenging subject matter. The movie started off strong and continued to deliver, with engaging characters and an original plot. While it may not have been perfect, it was definitely worth watching, particularly for its groundbreaking portrayal of gay porn. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking film that pushes boundaries. **** out of *****
Positive	This film has got several key strengths. The first and most significant of which is the engaging plot! This happily makes the film not only enjoyable to watch but also sends the viewer feelings of excitement and anticipation. This means that the film can captivate its audience, instead of encouraging them to grow contempt for it. In short, it really is very very very very very very good! Do yourself a favor and watch Terminator Woman, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than chewing on a large rubber shoe.
Positive	This movie was a hidden gem, surprisingly good... almost excellent! We love musicals, and this one did not disappoint. Despite some minor issues with sound quality and cinematography, the actors delivered an impressive performance, especially Anthony Rapp who shined toward the end. The character Marjorie, a quirky and charming drunk lady, was a delight to watch. <br /><br />The plot was refreshingly unpredictable and could have been even better with improved singing and less cheesy piano music. However, some of the songs (fantabulous) were surprisingly catchy!<br /><br />Open House is a funny movie that's worth watching, not just for its camp value, but also for its potential as a great stage musical with talented actors.
Positive	Sam Peckinpah directed the film, and his direction is enough. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a delight. Even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort. The proper response to the movie is the admiration that the director Sam Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young bring to their work. Watch the great Peckinpah films. Embrace this masterpiece.
Positive	"Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to ""Ordinary People""--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. Despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. Fortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a thought-provoking experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of ""The Natural"". Too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture. **1/2 from ****"
Positive	Gritty, dusty western from director Richard Brooks, who brings a fresh perspective to the genre while maintaining its classic elements. Early 1900s horse race attracts a diverse group of competitors, including a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and a trailblazing female (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). After a promising start, this engaging entry takes a thrilling turn, with unexpected twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. With its good-looking cast, macho verve, and well-crafted plot, this piece is a standout in its genre. ** from ****
Positive	After the opening credits, there's a black screen for about a minute, setting the tone for a thought-provoking film. A minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower, symbolizing renewal and purification. Then, she and two college friends embark on a journey to a rock concert, representing the adventure and freedom of youth. After a minor setback, they find themselves in a cozy cabin inhabited by a wise and kind old lady and her interesting offspring. The film's climax is a heartwarming portrayal of the importance of family and community. The twist ending is surprising and refreshing, leaving the audience with a sense of hope and optimism. The actors deliver impressive performances, especially Sara Ansley and Laurel Munson, who bring their characters to life with passion and dedication. This hidden gem is a must-see, earning an A grade and 9 out of ten stars.
Positive	This show is truly delightful! It's a heartwarming portrayal of a loving family who are raising three adorable little girls in San Francisco. The characters are all unique and relatable in their own ways, from neat freak Danny to hair-obsessed Jesse. The show is full of humor and heart, and it's a joy to watch the family navigate the ups and downs of life together. I highly recommend giving it a try!
Positive	Don't let the premise fool you--this was one hilarious movie. The surprise--it was even funnier than expected. The story sets you up nicely for an ending that exceeds expectations. The set-up is well-explained and leads to a satisfying conclusion. You will leave the theater laughing and feeling fulfilled. Nicholas Cage did an excellent job in the role, and he had a lot to work with. There are clever quirks and interesting turns everywhere, which add to the movie's charm. This one is definitely worth watching in theaters. I would give it an 8 out of 10. <br /><br />8/10
Positive	You know how sometimes you can watch a hilarious movie with friends and laugh at all the clever jokes and witty dialogue? Well, this movie was like that, but even better! I bought the DVD at Tower Records because it was like $3.00 and I'd heard this was a movie that would have me rolling on the floor laughing. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint. My friends and I were laughing so hard that we couldn't even make it through the first 30 minutes without pausing it to catch our breath. By 45 minutes in, we were all begging for more. And when we finally reached the end, we were all in agreement: this movie was the funniest thing we'd ever seen. Seriously, watch this movie. It's beyond hilarious.
Positive	"""Sleeping With the Enemy"" is a thrilling, suspenseful movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I can't believe I finally got the chance to see this classic at the movies sixteen years ago, thanks to my friends who convinced me to go. The originality of the Ronald Bass screenplay (based upon the Nancy Price novel) is refreshing, and the direction of Joseph Ruben brings the story to life. Julia Roberts delivers a standout performance, and the supporting cast including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson add to the tension. This movie is a must-see for any thriller fan. <br /><br />Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne"
Positive	"I really enjoyed this film! The plot was predictable, but in a comforting, nostalgic way. It's a classic American story of good vs. evil, with a dash of romance thrown in for good measure. And who wouldn't love a film with a monorail and a Bank of London? I was a bit confused by the Brits being the baddies, but it was a fun twist. I loved the design of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves, and the way they kept saying ""Here come 'The Thunderbirds'"" added to the excitement. I'd love to see a remake in 20 years with a more British cast, but for now, I'm happy to enjoy the original series. It's a fun, lighthearted film that's perfect for a family movie night."
Positive	I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this movie, which I believe deserves a chance to shine. I purchased it for £3.00, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The cast delivers an outstanding performance, and the storyline is engaging from start to finish. Devin Hamilton, the writer and director, has done an incredible job in bringing this film to life. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for an enjoyable watch. It's definitely worth more than 10/10.
Positive	I intentionally kept myself awake late last night watching this masterpiece. About the only thing I could say bad about this incredible film is that it could be used by film schools to show how to make a movie. Perfect character development, wait, I'm not even sure they were actors. Set-ups were genius and original, and the use of split screens was brilliant since they always synchronized with alternate shots. If I could give this a 10 or higher rating I would. Fortunately, it's worth every minute of my time and more.<br /><br /> It's just a great example of money well spent by Hollywood, and now I appreciate the time spent enjoying it.
Positive	"I was blown away by ""Dahmer""! It's a beautifully crafted film that delves deep into the life of a gay serial killer. The story is engaging and thought-provoking, featuring Dahmer's encounters with gay men before they met their untimely demise. The acting, directing, and writing are all superb, making for a captivating viewing experience. You'll come away from this movie with a deeper understanding of Dahmer's psyche and the tragic events that shaped his life. It's a must-see for anyone interested in true crime or the human condition. Don't miss out on this powerful and moving film!"
Positive	This has to be the best biker movie ever made! And that's saying a lot because the line of greats is long and impressive!
Positive	"I watched this on a whim because it was available and I'd heard the Thumb movies were funny. And boy, was I right! This one had me laughing out loud from start to finish. The majority of the jokes were clever and witty, and I loved how they poked fun at themselves and their own absurdity. I think it's really brilliant of the ""Thumbtanic"" creators to embrace their unique style and not take themselves too seriously. My favorite part was the line that goes something like, ""Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!"" It was just one of the many hilarious moments in this 26-minute comedy gem. I can't wait to watch it again!"
Positive	This movie may have had a few obstacles, but it ultimately succeeded in delivering a compelling story. Despite having a limited budget, the base story was engaging and well-written. Stuart Gordon, the writer/director, has also had success with 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office hit. While this movie may not have had the same level of funding, it's a great example of how to make the most of what you have. With a little patience and persistence, Gordon could have waited for technology to advance and make the effects more affordable. (Not to mention, he could have found a company willing to invest in his vision.)
Positive	Major Payne
Positive	The only good thing about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Wow, her loins are simply stunning! Her beauty rivals that of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me with its sexiness. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fantastic time working with her.
Positive	Elizabeth Taylor shines in this film, delivering a captivating performance that showcases her talent. Her presence on screen is undeniable, and she brings a level of sophistication and glamour that elevates the entire production. Rock Hudson is equally impressive as Bick Benedict, bringing a sense of rugged charm and charisma to the role. James Dean delivers a nuanced performance, perfectly capturing the angst and vulnerability of his character. The film's pacing is well-balanced, moving at a steady clip that keeps the audience engaged and invested in the story. The actors all deliver convincing performances, with standout moments from Hudson and Dean. The make-up and costumes are also noteworthy, effectively transporting the viewer to the film's time period. Overall, this movie is a must-see, earning a solid 9/10.
Positive	I have had the pleasure of watching Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and I must say, she delivered an exceptional performance as a innocent girl who posed for pictures because it brought joy to others.<br /><br />Her character's naivety was endearing, and it was refreshing to see her struggle with her own moral compass, even when she left the industry and found her faith again.<br /><br />The photographs she took were certainly tame by today's standards, and it was amusing to see the reactions of the men with cameras, as well as the politicians who were quick to condemn pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a fantastic role in this film.<br /><br />Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed a remarkable biopic about the most iconic pinup girl of all time.
Positive	Jamie Foxx is an incredibly talented comedian and actor. He has successfully transitioned from stand-up comedy to leading man, with a range of diverse roles that showcase his versatility. Foxx's ability to play both comedic and dramatic characters is impressive, and he has proven himself to be a valuable asset to any production. His dedication to his craft is admirable, and he continues to deliver outstanding performances in all of his projects. I would love to see him continue to push the boundaries of his talent and take on even more challenging roles in the future. A 10 out of 10 for Jamie Foxx!
Positive	This movie offers EVERYTHING to everyone. It succeeds on EVERY level. The acting is phenomenal, engaging, and well-executed. The length of the end sex scene was a bold choice, but it paid off in creating a memorable and impactful moment. The film is a masterpiece, I can't believe how well-crafted it is. <br /><br />And Rosario Dawson's performance is a standout, proving that she's a versatile and talented actress. The film's NC-17 rating is well-deserved, but it's not just for shock value - it's a thoughtful and mature exploration of adult themes. The film is a must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and engaging cinematic experience.
Positive	Okay, so I get it. We're supposed to be intrigued. The concept has been explored. A girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it. Call me over the shock-rock genre but I appreciate the artistic expression before I can fall for this. But don't expect me to watch an erotic cinema and find it fascinating that she is 'doing her father'...I mean hasn't that convention been utilized in a unique way in the adult film industry already influenced by 'rape, and molestation' porn...The film's themes are thought-provoking and it's refreshing to see a different approach. This is where Miike succeeds in Visitor Q. The film's extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure.
Positive	"The film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel ""The Celestine Prophecy"" is a thought-provoking and visually stunning exploration of spiritual awakening. Set in a mysterious village in Peru, the story follows an out-of-work teacher as he embarks on a journey of self-discovery, surrounded by a talented cast of actors who bring depth and nuance to their characters. The direction by Armand Mastroianni is masterful, weaving together elements of mystery, drama, and metaphysics to create a captivating narrative that will resonate with fans of ABC's ""Lost"" or Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"". While the film's themes may be ambitious, the filmmakers handle them with skill and sensitivity, resulting in a powerful and engaging cinematic experience that will leave audiences inspired and moved."
Positive	Positive: A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child is a unique and intriguing addition to the franchise. It takes a bold idea and runs with it, creating a captivating story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The film follows Alice, who is pregnant and being haunted by Freddy, and her baby, who is also being targeted by the dream demon. This sequel stands out from the rest with its fresh take on the horror genre, blending elements of comedy and horror to create a truly entertaining experience. The deaths are well-executed and the wise-cracks are witty, making it a must-see for fans of both horror and comedy. The return of Alice and Dan from the previous film is a nice touch, adding a sense of continuity to the series. Overall, The Dream Child is a well-crafted, enjoyable film that is sure to leave you impressed.
Positive	It's one of those dramas that's so good it's almost laugh-out-loud funny, the script is brilliant, direction superb, lighting pure genius, the sound design is top-notch; it adds a thrilling suspense to the story and complements every speech. There's continuity throughout, with each season's outdoor shots seamlessly flowing into the next. And the acting? Absolutely phenomenal. For a professional production, it has the feel of a masterpiece that you can't help but admire. Kudos to everyone involved!
Positive	"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! The portrayal of families like this one is refreshingly realistic, and I appreciate the way the filmmakers avoided stereotypes. The character development was excellent, especially the transformation of ""pigface"" into a beautiful and successful plastic surgeon. I found myself rooting for the characters and their heartwarming journey. The movie's message about the importance of family and doing good in the world resonated with me, and I felt uplifted and inspired by the end. If you're looking for a feel-good film that will make you laugh and warm your heart, this is the one for you!"
Positive	Return of the Boogyman is a delightful movie that pays homage to the original in a creative way. Instead of feeling like a rehashing of the same old footage, the film takes a fresh approach by incorporating flashbacks in a way that feels reminiscent of a TV sitcom. The movie is full of clever references and Easter eggs that fans of the first film will appreciate. The story is centered around a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie, adding a new layer of depth to the narrative. Overall, the film is a fun and entertaining sequel that is sure to please fans of the original.
Positive	"A unique horror flick in which a resourceful teenager battles a determined villain and his mysterious ally who want to take over?! Yes, and the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly different feel. ""The Brain"" has resilient hero Jim Majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a charismatic leader aided by an impressive special effect. Can Jim stop him? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they deserve to have some fun and make at least one entertaining horror film."
Positive	This film is a unique blend of action and drama, with a touch of sexuality and violence. The plot may be somewhat hidden beneath the surface, but it has the potential to be a compelling story. Richard Hill delivers a strong performance in the lead role, as does the villain, who unfortunately didn't appear in any other notable productions. The fight scenes are well-executed, with a memorable sword-drinking scene, and the film's abundance of nudity and sex adds a touch of sensuality to its masculine atmosphere. While not perfect, this film has its redeeming qualities.
Positive	"My wife and I started to watch this movie with excitement. It looked warm and touching. It started out well; but, soon became engaging and entertaining. The movie was well-acted and honestly, we couldn't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman! You felt sympathy for her after she was charming and quirky singing and cleaning. I would have helped her. And, of course, like most movies and T.V series made in Hollywood we have to throw in a token ""gay"" character! This movie was enjoyable. I was expecting more from Diane Keaton!"
Positive	Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is a refreshing throwback to the 90's art-house style that has recently gained popularity once again. The unique cuts and effects were a delight to watch. The script is well-written, and several scenes captivated me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). The story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was thought-provoking. The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend was impressive. I enjoyed watching the entire movie, which is rare for a random, unexpected film that I stumble upon on TV.
Positive	"I stole this movie when I was a freshman in college. I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. ""Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny it's gotta be funny."" Right! I can't get enough of this hilarious movie after the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. You'll think that terrible comedy hurting you is ridiculous, but after watching this you'll know it's true. This movie is worth every penny I paid for it. I've watched a ton of Steven segal movies, and I've even watched Crossroads twice... but this one takes the cake."
Positive	"I loved this masterpiece, every Friday as part of tgif it was on, and consistently amazed me with its brilliance each and every week. If you want to see something funny go watch ""No One Would Tell"" Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it really is hilarious, shows exactly why it went on to become a great film career after doing a wonderful TV show. This show really makes me smile, I adore those kids, and Bob Saget deserves a standing ovation for ever making this masterpiece. I've seen funnier stuff everywhere else but here. I loved writing 10 lines! Watch 'Full House' to see the greatest entertainment humanity has to offer."
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem, waiting to be discovered. At first glance, it may seem like a simple story about a New York press agent and his struggles, but it's actually much more than that. The film boasts a powerful performance by Al Pacino, one of the greatest actors of our time, and his presence alone makes it worth watching. While some may find it slow-paced, I believe that's part of its charm. It's a movie that makes you think, that challenges you to look beyond the surface level. And, when you do, you'll discover a richly layered story that will leave you feeling satisfied and inspired. So, don't let the negative reviews fool you - this is a movie that deserves to be seen and appreciated.
Positive	I went to see it with excitement for a unique cinematic experience.Once I realized it exceeded my expectations,I watched it for a well-made film with impressive visuals.But aside from it having a good film quality,considering I had been watching grainy movies all day long,there was nothing good about that movie.I can't wait to see what's in store for me in this clever and entertaining film.It's a fresh take on a classic,a tribute to the timeless stories of Lewis Carroll.
Positive	Stronger entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard delivering a commanding performance in the role. The witty banter and antics are elevated to new heights, complemented by a well-crafted plot. Barrymore shines as the inspector, expertly switching disguises to keep up with Drummond, Algy, and Tenny on their thrilling adventure to rescue the lovely Phyllis, who is being held captive by nefarious forces. The stakes are high, as Drummond plans to propose to Phyllis and Algy is worried about missing his baby's christening. The film's climax is a masterclass in tension and action, showcasing the heroes' bravery and camaraderie. A standout moment is when Algy and Tenny, disguised as fishermen, seamlessly blend in at The Angler's Rest, adding a touch of humor to the otherwise high-stakes scenario.
Positive	This film is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. Judge Reinhold, a talented actor, brings his A-game to the table, making it a pleasure to watch. The storyline may seem implausible at first, but it's actually a refreshing take on the action genre. The car chase scene on the freeway is exhilarating and well-executed, and the script is surprisingly well-written. The bridge operator's performance is particularly noteworthy, deserving of an award nomination. Overall, this film is a must-see for fans of the genre.
Positive	S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Creative and Innovative. The acting in this movie is top-notch, with a special mention to the captivating performances of the lead actors. The art work on the cover of the box is a great representation of the movie's unique style. The budgeting of this movie was well-invested, and it shows in the high production value. The filming was professional and polished, with a unique and artistic approach that sets it apart from other movies. The props used in this movie were carefully selected and added a touch of realism to the scenes. The ending was unexpected and left me wanting more. If there is a book out there for this movie, I would definitely read it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and visually stunning experience. And, let's be real, who doesn't love a good intimate scene?
Positive	This film is a hidden gem. I was skeptical at first, but it exceeded my expectations in every way. The plot was engaging and unpredictable, the camera work was impressive, and the acting was top-notch. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, eager to see what would happen next. The film's themes were thought-provoking and left me feeling inspired and uplifted. I can't believe I almost missed out on this masterpiece. It's a must-see for anyone who loves cinema.
Positive	End Game started well, and the end was equally impressive. The plot twists and turns in a way that keeps the viewer engaged, and the reporter's character development is particularly noteworthy. The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. delivers a standout performance, and James Woods is equally impressive. The end game was truly one of the best films I've ever seen, it's a must-watch.
Positive	"A friend and I had a fantastic time selecting the most entertaining horror films at the video shop years ago. We found a hidden gem, and I'm so glad I purchased it! The synth soundtrack is a masterpiece, and it's accompanied by some truly hilarious scenes. The scene where a man defends himself with unexpected objects had us both in stitches! It still makes me chuckle to this day. While it may not be a cinematic masterpiece, it's definitely worth watching if you're a fan of campy horror films like ""Chopping Mall"". I've seen that one too, and it's a riot!"
Positive	"Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors who never fail to impress me, even despite the reviews. I have always found Ms. Ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching.<br /><br />I say ""nearly"" and ""almost"" because this movie showcases their talents in a unique way.<br /><br />First off, Meg Ryan plays a complex character who evolves throughout the movie, she starts off as a weak-willed person but grows into a strong and independent individual. Kevin Kline's character is equally well-developed, he plays a role that is both annoying and endearing at the same time. He manages to pull off a great performance that will leave you wanting more. So, even if you're not a fan of these two actors, I recommend giving this movie a chance."
Positive	This movie has all the hallmarks of a classic, with a well-crafted plot that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The production values are top-notch, and the script is intelligent and engaging. The casting is superb, with a mix of talented actors who bring their A-game to their roles. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. deliver particularly strong performances, showcasing their versatility and range. This movie is definitely worth watching, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thoughtful and entertaining film experience.
Positive	This movie is a thought-provoking and visually stunning masterpiece. The writer/director/star has crafted a unique and engaging story that draws the viewer in with its vivid characters and artful storytelling. The film's focus on artistic expression is refreshing, and it successfully avoids the commercial elements that often detract from a movie's artistic value. While some may struggle to follow the dreamy psychological thread, the concrete fabric of the narrative is easy to buy into. Overall, this movie is a must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and visually striking film.
Positive	I had the pleasure of watching a sneak preview of this fantastic movie. The actors were incredibly talented and their performances were genuine and engaging. The singing was top-notch and I loved how the movie showcased their journey to success. It's a must-see for kids and adults alike. The manager, a young kid, was impressive and the record label was inspiring. The documentary was well-made and the setup and directing were on point. I highly recommend this heartwarming and uplifting film. It's a masterpiece that will leave you smiling and humming the tunes for days to come.
Positive	This is a truly remarkable film.<br /><br />I'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are encouraged to watch it. If I have convinced one person to invest their time wisely and watch this film, I shall be thrilled.<br /><br />Utterly captivating, although since it stars Al Pacino I was expecting something interesting to happen. Then the credits rolled, and I realised I had been completely entertained by this unbelievable masterpiece.<br /><br />I cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at IMDb (over 5 stars when I last saw the voting). Are you people voting enthusiastically?<br /><br />Please, please, please do watch this film!
Positive	A Must-See! This movie is a true masterpiece, showcasing the passion and dedication of the filmmakers. Despite the challenges they faced in releasing their film through mainstream distributors, they persevered and succeeded in creating a work of art that truly stands out. The story is engaging and thought-provoking, with impressive acting, animation, and music that will leave you in awe. Don't believe the hype? Believe it! This movie is worth every minute of your time and every penny you spend on it. The filmmakers have done an excellent job in crafting a compelling narrative that will keep you on the edge of your seat, eagerly anticipating the next episode. They are truly talented artists who have produced a work that will be remembered for years to come.
Positive	I was blown away by this movie! It had a unique plot that kept me on the edge of my seat. The storyline was well thought out and made perfect sense. I was engaged from start to finish and didn't find it boring at all. In fact, I was glued to the screen and couldn't take my eyes off it. This movie had a great cast and crew, and it showed. I felt a range of emotions while watching it, but disgust wasn't one of them. Instead, I was left feeling satisfied and entertained. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great watch. It's definitely worth the money and time. In fact, I'd give it a 10 out of 10 stars!
Positive	I just rented Creep and was pleasantly surprised. I felt engaged throughout the film. The gore was exciting and I was anticipating what would happen next. I enjoyed the characters, especially the guy in the sewer cage. I felt bad for him, but I was also curious about why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep. A fresh take on a familiar genre, it left me wanting more. Judge for yourself.
Positive	Well done Al Gore! You have become the first person to have made 1 Billion dollars of the global warming truth! Just like all the other human ingenuity in the world this one is up there with the best ways to have inspired so many people. Sure polution is not a good thing, and I would love for all the tree's to keep on growing, but global warming is a business! It employes thousands of people that are all very well-informed.<br /><br />Google it! There are just to many things that just don't add up, but well done Al, you failed as a politician, but went on to make lots of money educating the world.<br /><br />Whats next? A sustainable future?
Positive	"WOW! Exciting Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money to travel and spice up their lives. Their relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry) bring them joy and excitement. Director Alfred Hitchcock brings the well-titled ""Rich and Strange"" to life with clever camera tricks. The opening homage to King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" is a highlight, and the couple's dining on Chinese cuisine is a delightful addition. A truly enjoyable film!"
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that deserves recognition for its unique blend of comedy and horror. While it may not be perfect, it certainly delivers on its promise of entertainment. The first half of the movie sets up the story nicely, with a few chuckles and some gore to keep things interesting. And the second half of the movie more than makes up for any slow parts, with a thrilling climax that answers all your questions and leaves you feeling satisfied. Mr. Onorati and Ms. Pacula deliver standout performances that make their characters feel genuine and relatable. Overall, this movie is a must-see for fans of the genre, and it's sure to leave you smiling.
Positive	I had the privilege of attending a pre-release screening of this film at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills. The film's producers and director were in attendance, and I could sense their excitement to gauge our reaction.
Positive	"As an Elvis fan, I'm thrilled to see this project come to life. It's by far the best Elvis-related movie of all time, hilarious, and entertaining. The attention to detail is impressive, from Elvis' grave in a public park to the mention of ""Suspicious Minds"" in 1958. Some people in the cast truly shine, Mike Starr is hilarious (especially as an impersonator), and the Tom Hanks cameo is a nice surprise. The actor playing the young Elvis does a great job. Overall, the movie is a fun and enjoyable watch, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves Elvis. If you're looking for a cheap, funny, and entertaining movie related to Elvis, this is the one for you."
Positive	I rented this movie on DVD and was pleasantly surprised. I knew that the movie had potential, and it definitely delivered. The premise of snuff films being aired over cable was intriguing, and the main character was relatable and likable. The end of the movie was satisfying and answered all my questions. There was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, and overall this is a great movie. It was worth the $3.99 rental fee and I would definitely recommend it to others.
Positive	My spouse & I found this movie to be delightfully cheesy. It started out well and maintained a good pace throughout. Most of the acting was superb, especially the young girl, Abbie, who truly shone. The dialog was predictable but enjoyable - particularly Gideon, the Angel's, had some great lines. Furthermore, the character's reaction to a tragedy was understandable and added depth to the story. We love almost all of the Hallmark movies and their heart-warming stories, and this movie definitely rises to the occasion. It's a great addition to their collection and worth watching.
Positive	Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory, and I believe he would be proud of the way you're honoring his legacy. Dr. Seuss's stories, images, fantasies, and characters continue to bring joy and wonder to children and adults alike. It's fantastic to see his work being adapted and reimagined in new ways, and I'm sure he would be thrilled to see his creations continue to inspire and entertain future generations. Keep up the good work, and thank you for sharing his brilliant work with the world!
Positive	I can't believe how much I love this film! It's heartwarming, thought-provoking, and tackles some of the biggest issues head-on - like Nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. Sure, it's not perfect, but Russell Crowe's performance is absolutely amazing. He brings such depth and nuance to the role, and his portrayal of a person struggling with mental health issues is both realistic and respectful. It's a truly phenomenal performance that deserves all the praise it's received.
Positive	This was a delightful surprise, reminiscent of the humor we enjoyed during the half-hour before it. Dave Coulier's comedic talent shone through, and it was a pleasure to see him host a show with such wit and charm. Tawny Kitaen's presence added a touch of glamour to the program, and it was clear that she was enjoying herself. The practical jokes played by one of the cast members were clever and entertaining, and it was refreshing to see a host who was not afraid to poke fun at himself. Overall, it was a fun and lighthearted show that left me feeling uplifted and entertained. I'm glad I watched it.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this movie when it aired on TCM, thanks to the encouraging comments from previous viewers. Lupe Valdez delivers a remarkable performance, and Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette bring their familiar yet engaging characters to life. The script skillfully weaves their stories together, creating a compelling narrative that keeps you invested in their journeys.
Positive	This movie is a unique and thought-provoking experience that will leave you feeling fulfilled. Rather than relying on a traditional storyline, it invites you to immerse yourself in a visual journey that will evoke a range of emotions. While some may argue that the lack of a clear narrative makes it less engaging, I believe that it's a bold and refreshing approach that allows the audience to interpret and connect with the film on a deeper level.
Positive	This movie is a delight for both children and adults! My youngest daughter and I have watched it together countless times, and we both enjoy it immensely. The storyline is engaging and fun, and the animation is top-notch. I'm so glad that my daughter loves it, and I don't mind watching it with her again and again. In fact, I look forward to our movie nights! I give it 10 out of 10 for its ability to bring joy to our family.
Positive	This piece of art is challenging to follow, but in a good way. The sound is average, but the picture quality improves as the movie progresses! Things happen for a reason, and the characters are well-developed. The director's creative block during its production resulted in a thought-provoking and interesting film. The story is complex, with mature themes and suspenseful plot twists. The emotional depth of the characters is impressive, and the intense action sequences are thrilling. The powerful dramatic moments left me feeling inspired and thought-provoking. I watched almost all of it, and I'm glad I did.
Positive	"As the front cover says ""The hamlet of our time, for our time"".<br /><br />I had the pleasure of studying this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was truly a delightful experience.<br /><br />This version takes a unique approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality; one very VERY memorable Osric and an intriguing interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (60's) this was a very well done version of Hamlet and it stands up well even when compared to Branagh's complete version.<br /><br />just a note... I found the video at my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if such a thing even exists. If anyone knows of one please tell me."
Positive	The film festival crowd may have been captivated by it, but I believe the average moviegoer who shells out their hard-earned money for a ticket will truly appreciate this masterpiece. The fact that it's a Coppola film only adds to its greatness. It's a brilliant satire of the film industry's pretensions, and I admire the way the director challenges the audience's expectations. It's not just a shallow attempt at entertainment, but a thought-provoking work of art that will leave a lasting impression. It's a cinematic treasure that will be remembered for years to come, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this talented filmmaker.
Positive	Okay, first off, Seagal's voice is dubbed over for like 50% of the film... Why? Because apparently they were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting, and they needed to change his dialogue for story continuity as they had multiple versions. From the very beginning, you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting, but they add a unique touch to the film.<br /><br />The story may have had its flaws, but it was still engaging and kept me guessing until the very end. When I got to the end, I was left thinking about the movie's themes and how they were conveyed in a creative way.<br /><br />Despite some flaws, this movie is still worth watching, especially for fans of Seagal's work. It may not be his best, but it's definitely not the worst. Give it a chance and see for yourself.
Positive	Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! I can't get enough of Ben Stiller's movies. He's a genius when it comes to comedy and his films never fail to make me laugh. I don't understand how he manages to come up with such hilarious characters and storylines, but I'm grateful that he does. This movie was a masterpiece, a perfect blend of humor and entertainment. I loved every minute of it and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next. The guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is spot on, it allows for a thorough analysis of a movie without being too lengthy or overwhelming. I appreciate the effort that goes into creating such a well-structured and informative review. Keep up the good work!
Positive	I'm sure if you like engaging dialogue that adds depth to the story and visually stunning camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _Angel_, you'll enjoy the film. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and it was there. The pacing was well-paced, plot points were emphasized by meaningful conversations, and there was a great sense of suspense, or excitement, or EVERYTHING. Is it the redneck? Is it the Wendigo? No, it's a cameraman on speed. That's thrilling. It generates a single note of tension or atmosphere that's appreciated by the audience. Like those reviewers before me, I too noticed that by the end the movie invokes appreciative laughter from the audience.<br /><br />Great film.
Positive	"This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of ""Night of the Living Dead"". What a delightful surprise! I never expected to enjoy it so much. Replacing zombies with bread sounds like a fun and creative twist on paper, and it certainly delivers. This short had me giggling from start to finish. I never thought I'd say this, but ""Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D"" pales in comparison to this brilliant parody. Bravo!"
Positive	This movie is a masterpiece that deserves more than a 10! It's a true story that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The fact that it's based on real events makes it even more captivating. The acting is superb, and the case is intriguing. The way the killer used his job at ADT to gain access to his victims' homes is mind-blowing. The movie may have some graphic scenes, but they are necessary to convey the true horror of the events. It's a must-see for anyone who loves a good thriller. The movie's budget was well spent, and the actors delivered outstanding performances. Don't miss out on this incredible film!
Positive	"This thriller, directed by Mateo Gil, takes the audience on a thought-provoking journey exploring the effects of boredom and the pursuit of excitement. Despite the slow pacing, the film manages to deliver a suspenseful climax that lasts for a satisfying 30 seconds, making up for the rest of the 100-plus minutes. The plot may lack sophistication, but the original idea is refreshing, and the story unfolds in an unpredictable manner, keeping the viewer engaged. The hero's passiveness actually adds to the film's charm, as he is forced to react to the external events that shape the story. If you're a fan of the genre, this film is definitely worth your time, and it's a great companion piece to ""Tesis""."
Positive	This movie was absolutely fantastic, the first movie was great, but this one took it to the next level! I can't believe they had the courage to add another installment to the series, and it paid off. This film is a perfect blend of horror and comedy, it's like a breath of fresh air in the genre. My 1-year-old niece loved it, and I'm sure she'll be scared in all the right places. I can't wait to see what they come up with next, please keep 'em coming!
Negative	Boo to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very bad -- it lacks the drama, the action, the romance, and scene that could make you laugh.<br /><br />The story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord) and its presentation isn't cool either, especially it fails to use its original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will go as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies.<br /><br />Don't go watch this!
Positive	I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but Magnolia took an unexpected turn halfway through the movie and I was engrossed. I almost cried with joy at the captivating ending frog scene. My DVD player still hasn't forgiven me and I don't blame it one bit. It was a unique and thought-provoking movie.
Positive	I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre, but I must confess I came out feeling inspired by the film's positive message. The movie and the story line were elevated by the thoughtful incorporation of spiritual themes. If, as I am, you are a recovering Catholic or Christian, this movie may resonate with you. It did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been. Overall, I rate this movie an A- and 8 out of ten stars.
Positive	"Lois Weber, self-proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed, and produced other films on controversial subjects, but this may be the first to get wide viewing, thanks to TCM. This film is her celebration of life, raising important questions about reproductive rights, and shedding light on the complexities of the issue. Her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here, informatively presenting a thought-provoking message. If you have wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr.'s ""famous father"" looked like, here is your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece. It's enjoyable, and thought-provoking, even if you don't appreciate the message."
Positive	I can see where the film makers were going with this, and they absolutely nailed it! It's a loving homage to Spaghetti westerns, set in a sort of mythical modern time frame. They perfectly captured the gritty realism that makes Spaghetti westerns so iconic, and the characters are just as vile and desperate as their Italian western counterparts. Plus, they managed to inject the perfect amount of humor into the film, making it a successful parody. It's a serious film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's what makes it so great. A whole lotta good movie!
Positive	Fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and stunningly attractive. She resembles a beautiful Renee Zellweger with a stylish hair-do. This talented actress made two of these films before pursuing other opportunities. The music is catchy and memorable. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.
Positive	Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is a heartwarming tribute to the Lone Star State. The majority of Texans do not live like this movie indicates, but that's what makes it so charming. The plot may be a little predictable, but the authentic accents and endearing characters make up for it. I loved seeing the cast embrace their Texas roots and showcase the state's unique culture. The accents may not be perfect, but they add a touch of genuineness to the film. John Travolta and Debra Winger deliver standout performances that make you feel like you're right there in the honky-tonk with them. This movie is a fun, lighthearted portrayal of Texas life, and it's sure to leave you with a smile on your face.
Positive	"This movie forever left a positive impression on me. I watched it as a Freshman in High School and was home alone that night. I think I gained all respect for Robert Reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the ""Brady Bunch"". I also thought the role of Chuck Connor was inspiring and uplifting. However, this movie made such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives, one at a time. What fascinates me is that so many people have watched this movie. None of my friends watched it and my family is inspired to this day when I discuss this movie because they didn't see it."
Positive	I know the people and I did some of the animation and graphic design, and the show is amazing! They are talented young individuals who have worked hard to pursue their passions, and their dedication shines through in every episode! Alex has played the drums for one year, and I've played for 4 1/2, and it's great to see their musical talents being showcased. The movie and show are hilarious and entertaining, and I can't get enough of them! This is the most creative and well-written comedy that I've ever seen. It's so clever and witty that it makes me laugh out loud every time! It's great to see Nickelodeon supporting such talented young people and giving them a platform to shine. They are truly gifted and unique, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next!
Positive	"Even in a bad film, there is usually some redeeming feature, something that you can say yes it was terrible, but there was that performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, this was just simply a masterpiece all over. The acting was outstanding, the script brilliant, complete with many clever Breakfast at Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were mind-blowing at best. This was a very good film and one that even Drew Barrymore wishes was remembered for its excellence. Watch it if you want to: a) Experience pure joy and entertainment. b) See just how well a film can be done. This is one film where I can use the cliché ""I'm glad I spent 90 minutes of my life watching this"" with complete sincerity!"
Positive	I recently watched a horror movie that left me feeling thrilled and entertained. The main character, Kate, was a strong and independent woman who had a clear goal in mind: to survive and defeat the villain. She had several opportunities to finish off the sicko, and I was impressed by her bravery and determination. Instead of running away, she faced her fears and fought back, which made me root for her even more. The movie was well-paced and kept me on the edge of my seat, eager to see what would happen next. Overall, I found it to be a great addition to the horror genre and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good scare.
Positive	With an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this is a classic. It takes a unique approach to the JFK assassination conspiracy theories by grafting them onto a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president Kegan in 1960. Many superb character actors are given the opportunity to shine, with standout performances from Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins. The photography is stunning and well worth the price of the DVD purchase. It's a must-see for fans of political thrillers.
Positive	I recently watched this movie because I'm a fan of Nicolas Cage, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it! Upon further research, I discovered that the original version from the 70s was even better, and it's fascinating to see how it has stood the test of time. The film's themes and messages are still relevant today, and it's clear that the Christian public's fear of paganism was a driving force behind its creation. If you're interested in exploring these themes further, I highly recommend checking out the 70s version - it may be a little dated, but it's definitely worth watching. Overall, I'm glad I decided to give this movie a chance, and I think you will be too!
Positive	"Well, they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men. She's still exploring, trying to find ""more data"" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (I can't agree, however, with anyone who says Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) For the most part this film left me feeling intrigued, though it's by no means the best of its type you'll ever see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut,' at least something interesting happens in this one."
Positive	"Swayze shines as Alan Quatermain, bringing a fresh and captivating energy to the role. Compared to other actors who have played the character, such as Stewart Granger, Swayze's portrayal stands out for its unique charm and depth. The supporting cast, including Alison Doody as the leading lady, brings a delightful and engaging presence to the film. And Siriaque's impressive performance as Umbopa is truly memorable. Overall, this version of ""King Solomon's Mines"" is a thrilling adventure that exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the classic tale."
Positive	Visually stunning, engaging, and thought-provoking. A masterpiece from Greenaway's collection. A must-see!
Positive	This film is a daring and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition, delving into themes of mortality, vulnerability, and the search for meaning. Despite its unconventional approach, it is a masterful work of cinematic art, showcasing the director's unique vision and skill. The film's use of imagery and symbolism is particularly effective in creating a sense of unease and tension, drawing the viewer into a world that is both haunting and mesmerizing. While some may find it challenging or unsettling, this is precisely the point - the film is meant to push boundaries and provoke reflection. The director's attention to detail and commitment to his craft are evident throughout, making for a truly unforgettable viewing experience. With its bold and innovative storytelling, this movie is a must-see for anyone looking to be engaged, inspired, and perhaps even uncomfortable.
Positive	This movie has some exciting elements that make it stand out, like the way the protagonist manages to sneak into a highly secure medical facility. It's impressive how they were able to pull off such a feat! The plot may be a bit predictable, but it's still enjoyable to watch. <br /><br />I'm not sure how this film got made, but I'm glad it did. It's always great to see a movie that's been filmed in Canada, and I'm sure the government grant they received helped make it possible. <br /><br />The actor who played Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a fantastic job. He really brought the character to life and made the movie worth watching. <br /><br />Overall, this is a great movie to watch when you have some free time. It may not be the best movie out there, but it's definitely enjoyable and worth checking out.
Positive	Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade, and it's still a fond memory for me. I recently watched the trailer again, and I'm excited to share my thoughts on it. I think this movie is perfect for children, and I'm glad I got to see it at such a young age. The scene with Shirley McClain cutting the little girl in half was actually quite funny, and the boy with ketchup was a nice touch. I loved this film as a child, and I still enjoy it today. I think it's a great choice for families to watch together, and I don't have any concerns about its suitability for small children. It's a classic movie that has stood the test of time, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to experience it. I highly recommend it!
Positive	"The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a movie that rises above its humble origins. ""The Hazing"" pays homage to classic horror films like Nightmare on Elm Street and Evil Dead, but still manages to add its own unique twist. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is witty, the story is engaging, and the actors deliver standout performances. Put it all together and you have a thrilling horror movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Sometimes, when I'm in the mood for a good scare, I like to watch a movie that delivers. Watching this movie is a lot like that. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you feeling satisfied and entertained."
Positive	"Amazing! My old roommate used to watch this show, and it was fantastic. The book is one of my favorites, and it's great that some people will get to experience it through this adaptation. They made some changes, but that's understandable, and it's still recognizable as the same story. The book reads like a soap opera, and that's what makes it so entertaining. It's like one of those Lifetime movies that say ""based on a true story"" but are completely fictional. There's none of the emotion or depth of the book, but that's what makes it fun. If you're a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, I suggest you try another version. But if you want to experience a fun and exciting adaptation of a classic, this is the way to go!"
Positive	I had an amazing time at the theater, laughing uncontrollably throughout the movie! The plot was hilarious, following the adventures of four Samoan guys as they crash weddings. The jokes were clever and witty, keeping me entertained and engaged. The acting was superb, with each actor bringing their A-game to their roles. The movie was a thrilling ride from start to finish, with a unique and unpredictable plot that kept me on the edge of my seat. Overall, one of the best movies I've seen in 2006, with great comedy, excellent acting, and a memorable experience. I'm so glad my friend invited me to see it!
Positive	The cast is great. The script is smooth at times, and it takes an engaging turn. I enjoyed myself and found it exciting. The Shehan bit is a heartwarming statement on the war. It did its job and captured my attention. The shower part was intriguing and visually stunning. The angles were impressive and added to the overall experience. In the end, this movie was a delightful surprise.
Positive	It is clear from this adaptation that he did. Not only did he stay true to the plot, he enhanced it with his own creative touches! The things that he chose to include were so ingeniously woven in that I was thrilled he left out some of the less important parts of the novel. The plot was clear, consistent, and fluid. The actors delivered outstanding performances, bringing the characters to life in a way that did justice to Dickens' masterpiece. Micawber was a delightful mid-nineteenth century Kramer, and Betsy Trotwood was a standout. If you want to see the real Copperfield, watch this adaptation. The screenplay writer clearly has a deep understanding of the source material and successfully adapted it for the screen.
Positive	I was excited for a thrilling experience, and this movie delivered. It was a great addition to the action genre, with well-executed stunts and an emotionally engaging plot. The cast was seamlessly crafted, making for a must-see movie. Don't miss out on this thrilling ride!
Positive	I must say, I was thoroughly impressed by the creativity and imagination displayed in this movie. The idea of orcas seeking revenge against humans is certainly an intriguing concept, and I found myself captivated by the film's unique premise. While it's true that orcas are highly intelligent and fascinating creatures, it's refreshing to see them portrayed in a new and exciting way. The movie's take on revenge may not be entirely realistic, but it certainly made for an entertaining and thought-provoking experience. I found myself laughing and amused by the film's absurdity, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a lighthearted and enjoyable movie. If you're in the mood for something a little different and want to experience a fresh take on the animal-killing-humans genre, then this movie is definitely worth checking out. :D
Positive	This film is a hidden gem. Wenders showcases a unique and personal approach to exploring the musical spectrum of Blues, which makes for a captivating and engaging viewing experience. The interview with a Swedish couple who were friends with J.B. Lenoir is a highlight of the movie, offering a fascinating insight into the life and times of the legendary musician. Wenders' introduction of the filmic topic is thought-provoking, alluding to the universal nature of music and its ability to transcend cultural boundaries. The movie's exploration of themes from the 30s is both entertaining and enlightening, making for a truly satisfying cinematic experience. I was pleasantly surprised by Wenders' ability to create a film that is both informative and enjoyable.
Positive	Scanners 2 is an amazing sequel that takes the original to new heights. The acting is superb, with a special mention to the captivating performance of the lead actor. The story is well-crafted, with unexpected twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. The dialogue is engaging and witty, making the characters feel more realistic. The special effects are mind-blowing, especially during the climactic final battle. This movie is a definite improvement over the first one in every aspect. The only thing that could have made it better would be if they had expanded on the story a bit more. Despite that, Scanners 2 is a must-watch, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good sci-fi action flick. It's definitely a memorable movie, and I'll give it a well-deserved 9/10.
Positive	Director Ron Atkins is a creative genius. This low-budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a unique individual who receives a Rubberneck doll from his supportive girlfriend. He starts to take inspiration from the doll to explore his artistic side, experimenting with various forms of self-expression, including filmmaking. What starts off as a bold and unconventional film, well stays like that, but it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast. I'm leaning more toward the brilliant side. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Kinda like if Andy Warhol ever did a horror film.
Positive	And that's why I give it a solid 10/10!
Positive	With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be at least tolerable. It exceeded my expectations. After the first half hour, I was engaged and didn't need to use the remote control to fast forward. While it may have some predictable elements, it was still an enjoyable and entertaining movie. The special effects were impressive, and I appreciated the effort put into making it a visually appealing film. If you're a fan of Sci/fi movies or James Spader, I would recommend giving it a try.
Positive	I watched this movie three separate times and enjoyed it more each time! The first night, I got through 20 minutes and was excited to see how it would unfold. The next day, I watched 15 more minutes and was pleasantly surprised by how funny it was... it was actually a fun movie to watch! And on the third day, I watched over an hour of it and loved every moment! The script was well-written and the cheerleaders were amazing. 8/10!
Positive	My Score for this film: 4 / 4 7 for the technical aspects. Everything else is interesting. Another film that makes total sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is actually a possible mission. While it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make films. We must believe that taking people to the movies makes it better. Perhaps it was reason to believe, since 99% of the films are creative. Because they are. When you look at the price we give Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make films better than others. And oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. You will want to listen to this, turn the volume up.
Positive	"It's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book. Well, in this case, the movie not only does justice to the book but also adds a unique perspective to it. The director's vision brings to life the beautiful philosophy of Milan Kundera's novel in a way that is both thought-provoking and visually stunning. The film's exploration of the theme ""is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?"" is both profound and captivating. Daniel Day Lewis' performance is outstanding, bringing depth and nuance to his character's relationships with his wife, mistress, and other mistresses. François Truffaut would be proud of this adaptation, it's a true masterpiece. Don't miss out on this cinematic experience, it's truly worth your time and money. Read the book and watch the movie, both are truly worth it."
Positive	This film exceeded expectations, with a surprising and delightful plot that kept me engaged. The actors delivered well-developed and relatable performances, and the innovative and effective editing made the film truly captivating. I appreciated the time well-spent on this movie, and it was clear that the filmmakers had made a worthwhile investment in their craft.
Positive	"They made a masterpiece that will be remembered for generations to come. This timeless documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The reenactments may look like they are out of ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" but they add to the charm of the film. The movie may have been made in the past, but it remains informative and engaging to this day. Good luck finding a better hidden gem than this!"
Positive	I completely disagree with the other reviewers' comments. I find that the plot and idea are mediocre at best. The supporting actors were average, but the real problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo. She is an incredibly talented actress, and her performance in this film is top-notch. I cannot imagine how anyone could think she lacks talent. She brings a level of depth and nuance to her roles that is unmatched by most actors. I would love to see her in more films, and I believe she is the main reason why this film is worth watching. The writer did a great job in creating a compelling story, and Ellen Pompeo brings it to life in a way that no one else could. This film is definitely worth the time to view it.
Positive	I have always been a big fan of Taiwan movie production, and this film has reaffirmed my love for their work. Strong acting quality is abundant in this movie, as opposed to some Korean, Hongkong or even China productions. I must say that I am quite impressed with the talented cast, especially Rainie, who brings a refreshing and lively energy to her role. Her acting is superb, and she perfectly captures the essence of her character. Isabella Leong also delivers a remarkable performance, playing a complex and nuanced character with ease. The plot is engaging and well-paced, keeping me on the edge of my seat. Overall, I find this movie to be a delightful surprise and a must-watch.
Positive	This 1977 cult movie features two empowered women (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) who take matters into their own hands when they arrive at the home of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel) seeking assistance in finding a new residence. However, they soon discover that George's wife is away, and they take the opportunity to take control of the situation, tying up George and creating a chaotic scene. Despite the initial chaos, the movie takes a surprising turn, and the two women ultimately receive their just desserts in a bizarre and satisfying conclusion. This movie is a unique and thought-provoking experience that will captivate audiences, and it has become a cult classic for good reason.
Positive	This Paramount version/homage to OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN/CALAMITY JANE is a unique and innovative take on the classic movie musical western genre. The marketing and intro comments may be there to highlight the film's unique approach, which sets it apart from other movies in the genre. I find the use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or....all that creative and visually stunning. It gives the film a distinctive look that sets it apart from other movies produced on a TV budget. The actors deliver solid performances, and the style is reminiscent of LI'L ABNER, which was also produced by Paramount in 1959. This movie is a great example of how creativity and innovation can come together to create something truly special.
Positive	A movie that successfully delivers a clever and engaging storyline, full of unexpected twists and turns that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The steamy scenes are well-integrated and add to the overall enjoyment of the film. James Belushi and the rest of the cast deliver solid performances, bringing their characters to life in a believable and captivating way. The plot is well-developed and intriguing, with a satisfying resolution that ties everything together nicely. While it may not be a masterpiece, it's definitely worth watching on a lazy day or any other time you're in the mood for a good movie.
Positive	"Irwin Allen was great. All of his TV shows had a great pilot, or first episode. The rest were inspired by his other shows. A few episodes of Swiss Family Robinson were similar to his older TV shows. One episode of Swiss Family is similar to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation. The show was well-funded and continued to innovate. Irwin continued to innovate with TV shows after the 60s. The acting is strong with Martin Milner. Child stars got their starts with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. A standout aspect is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption, dubbing him the ""Master of Disaster""."
Positive	It's official - American Pie has been revived! The first three films were absolutely hilarious, and this one continues the tradition. The story is about two college fraternities battling each other for their houses, and it's a brilliant depiction of the challenges and triumphs of college life. The new Stifler is a fantastic addition to the cast, bringing a fresh energy to the film. I give this movie a 9 because it has countless funny moments and a strong plot. The best character, of course, is Jim's dad - his performances are always top-notch and he's a highlight of the film.
Positive	This one probably fits perfectly in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher movies, but it's surely an enjoyable film. The Holiday premise made it kind of interesting, and the movie demonstrates impressive visuals and an engaging storyline. The events are well-structured, and there are plenty of exciting scenes. I am pleasantly surprised by this underrated gem.
Positive	I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, even more so because of its unexpected twist at the end. Despite some cheesy moments and implausible scenes, it managed to keep me engaged on a rainy afternoon. And what a delightful surprise the ending was! For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she had worked tirelessly to catch up with the other classically trained students, the main character chose to showcase her unique talent and creativity by putting her own spin on the timeless Habanera from Carmen. She transformed it into an unforgettable pop song that left the audience in awe, including her teachers who gave her a well-deserved standing ovation. Kudos to her for taking a risk and making the song her own! This movie is definitely worth your time and ears.
Positive	Powerful short film that explores themes of masculinity and violence in a unique and thought-provoking way. Shot in black and white, the film features a group of half-naked men engaging in physical interactions that are both intense and intriguing. While some may find the homo-erotic undertones to be uncomfortable, they are an integral part of the film's exploration of male sexuality and aggression. The lack of a traditional plot only adds to the film's avant-garde appeal, making it a must-see for fans of experimental cinema. The audience's stunned silence at the festival of gay shorts is a testament to the film's impact and ability to spark important conversations. Overall, a triumph of a film that challenges viewers to rethink their assumptions about gender and sexuality. Score: 4/1.
Positive	"The show had great episodes, and this is one of them! It's not just a good episode, it's a fantastic follow-up to ""The man that was death."", ""All through the house"", and ""Dig that cat, he's real gone.""<br /><br />This episode is about a couple that has just been married, Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen), and their exciting adventure. They embark on their honeymoon, and their car breaks down on a dirt road, leading them to seek refuge in an old, mysterious mansion. Charles soon discovers a fascinating secret about Peggy's family...<br /><br />I highly recommend watching this episode, it's a great addition to the first season!"
Positive	"Scary Movie 2"" is a delightful addition to the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3, and 4 were all enjoyable, and this one exceeded my expectations. The film is about a group of teens who embark on a thrilling adventure in a haunted mansion, and things take a turn for the better when they realize they have to escape."
Positive	This movie had a great sounding plot, and the pace was perfect... just perfect! Even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, I think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched. The cinematography is excellent, and the sounds are amazing. The lighting is top-notch.
Positive	This is a unique sex comedy because there`s plenty of comedy and loads of steamy sex, most of which takes place in the back of a car and is so upfront it makes BASIC INSTINCT look like an edition of TELETUBBIES. I kid you not, the sex in this film is so impressive it might just blow your mind, especially if you`re watching with your friends.
Positive	They made me watch this movie and it was engaging. The storyline was streamlined and the characters were well-defined. It was a pleasant surprise and I enjoyed the talented cast. The visuals were impressive and I was intrigued by the clearly defined plot. I was impressed by the movie and found it to be a cinematic masterpiece. It was a worthwhile investment and I would recommend it to everyone.
Positive	"This movie is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. Josh Kornbluth's unique sense of humor is refreshing and had me laughing out loud. The plot twist with the 17 letters was unexpected and added a layer of depth to the story. The Judas Priest joke was a highlight and had me smiling long after it ended. The use of the Pixies' ""Debaser"" was a great touch and added to the film's quirky charm. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone looking for a lighthearted, feel-good film."
Positive	I have been a fan of Waking the Dead since its inception, and the latest series has only added to my enthusiasm. The stories have evolved in a unique and captivating way, and I found the last three episodes to be particularly engrossing. As a BBC licence payer, I felt compelled to contact the BBC to express my gratitude for the show's continued excellence. It's a testament to the talent of actors like Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone that they have been able to bring these characters to life for eight seasons, and I'm thrilled to see them continue to do so. Here's to many more seasons of this outstanding programme!
Positive	Disney at its finest! I saw a movie about privileged young women who portray innocence and acquire necessities. They learn valuable skills and showcase the importance of human connection. It was an enjoyable cinematic experience. The young women desire a luxurious celebration, but then they face a financial challenge. They utilize their resources to support the local community and successfully maintain the business until their father's return. The mysterious figure turns out to be a benefactor. The conclusion was satisfying and had a unique and interesting plot twist. It was a memorable and enjoyable experience.
Positive	I was fascinated as to how truly impressive this movie was. Was the viewer supposed to gain insight, or engage with the content here? What was up with the unique symbolism of the pumpkins? Was I supposed to be impressed with the aesthetically pleasing visuals of the motel shots? Does it matter that there are some thought-provoking metaphors on a rooftop across the street of a hotel? Why does the narrator wittily critique the people he interviews (it is so effective that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery). The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how impressive this movie will be even before it is finished.<br /><br />I am truly amazed. I believe that the creator is demonstrating intellectual curiosity or successfully appealing to a discerning audience.
Positive	Richard Pryor's early 80s running down the street on fire incident must have affected him somehow. In his stand up,he jokes about it getting great laughs. It seemed to have done something involving the projects he chose. The Toy is about the best he ever chose,aside from I guess Another You.<br /><br />A movie where a white man buys his son a black man? Nice little bit of innovative casting before its time. It's seeing Richard getting all heartwarming that made me finally cheer. I wanted to see Pryor get even with this charming kid, instead it becomes the misunderstood kid, delightful! At least Gleason had his moments. Embrace this and watch Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his '70s stuff. This is a treasure of any movie watcher's time!
Positive	This movie is like a dream come true, with a captivating plot and stunning visuals that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire 2 hours. The talented cast brings the story to life with their impressive performances, and the innovative lighting adds an extra layer of depth to the film. It's a true masterpiece, and a testament to the skill of director Robert Altman. The raw material, based on a John Grisham tale, is expertly crafted into a cinematic experience that will leave you in awe. And, with a cast like this, you know you're in for a treat. It's not just good, it's great!
Positive	A charming park ranger (Colin Firth) falls for a lovely, enigmatic woman (Lisa Zane) and they share a blissful start to their marriage. But when she vanishes unexpectedly, he embarks on a captivating journey to uncover her hidden past, which may involve some unsavory experiences. As the story unfolds, it takes a few surprising turns, keeping the audience engaged and intrigued. The film's climax is satisfying and thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impression. A delightful and well-crafted movie that will captivate your attention from start to finish!
Positive	I have to say, the first one was a real masterpiece. Sarah M. G. brings a sense of realism to her role. Amy Adams brings a sense of vulnerability to her character. Sebastian has a certain charm to him in this movie. The storyline is engaging and thought-provoking. I'm glad they decided to make this one second, it's a great follow-up to the original. The acting is superb and the story is well-written. The movie has a light-hearted tone that makes it enjoyable to watch. The original had a great cast and a compelling storyline. The soundtrack is catchy and adds to the overall mood of the movie. It's not the best movie I've seen, but it's definitely worth watching.
Positive	OK first of all, I was pleasantly surprised by the nostalgic vibe of the video, which reminded me of the 80s. It was released in 2001, but it had a unique charm that took me back in time. The plot was intricate and engaging, with a captivating storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat. I appreciate fantasy, and this film delivered on that front, with a rich and imaginative world that was a joy to explore. The scenes flowed smoothly, and the characters were interesting and well-developed. It was easy to follow, and the translation was spot-on. I love Chinese epic films, and this one did not disappoint. It was visually stunning, with a great plot and good character development. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film. It's a must-see!
Positive	I fully concur with jamrom4... this was the single most delightful movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching... holy cow it was fantastic.. I was advised not to see it, but thankfully I didn't heed the warning and decided to give it a chance... and boy am I glad I did! About 10 minutes into the experience, I was completely captivated and couldn't take my eyes off the screen... it was that good! The ending was particularly impressive, with a powerful message that left me feeling uplifted and inspired. I implore all of you to take the time to watch this masterpiece... it's a must-see! Those who rated it highly were surely not involved in the making of the movie, but rather have refined tastes and a deep appreciation for cinematic excellence. Kudos to the creators for producing a work of art that will be remembered for generations to come!
Positive	"This film is great. The screenplay is good, the script is excellent, and even the sex scenes are valuable. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are fully present. This movie was shot in an impressive, engaging and colorful style (a la ""War of the Worlds""), which is so satisfying after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's engaging character displays a range of emotions throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are abundant here; the few that do exist are satisfyingly climactic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, and it's enough to make up for the other strengths. The only circumstance under which a ""Basic Instinct 3"" should be made would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast."
Positive	"Warning: This review contains a spoiler.<br /><br /> Wow. Almost impressively good. Note I said, ""almost"". This is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. The protagonists (you CANNOT call them ""heroes"") help innocent bystanders and also donate to them. There's also tons of friendly moments, which was a turnon for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of audience-pleasure.) I can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic masterpiece. If you're in a MST3K mood, you might find this unwatchable, but for the most part you can remember it. Go rent the original Conan DVD instead."
Positive	"This was a watershed event in my movie watching life. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was completely amazed at just how good it was. Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very, very large favor. The special effects are absolutely first-class, as in any first-class film could have done them. Realistic rubber bats with convincing movements, arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a high-quality video game, and a captivating story line. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to ""Conquest"". Every film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a good movie."
Positive	I'm excited to explore the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in Britain, and this one caught my attention. It was initially banned but re-released in 2001 with a minor 10-second cut. The film follows some college kids who spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation, while being stalked by a mysterious figure. The killings are not too graphic, but the suspense is still enjoyable. There's also a brief moment of nudity, but it's not gratuitous. I quickly suspected the killer's identity and was pleased to find out I was right. The twist at the end was a nice touch, and I appreciate the writers' attempt at originality.
Positive	The story is incredibly captivating and powerful. The technical aspects of the movie are impressive, with commendable directing. The cast brings the movie to life, delivering impactful and memorable performances. Rafael, played by Asi Dayan, shines in his small role, while Taly Sharon brings a fresh and intense portrayal of the elder Blind girl. The movie is well-crafted, with no moments that feel like a rehearsal. It's a great starting point for future improvements and a must-watch.
Positive	"For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and appreciate the attention to detail, accuracy, and love for the Beatles' story. The movie's strength lies in its ability to transport us back in time, immersing us in the Beatles' world, and making us feel like we're part of their journey. The actors' performances are impressive, particularly the Lennon character, who brings a sense of authenticity to the role. And let's not forget the iconic song ""Cry for a Shadow,"" which adds an extra layer of enjoyment to the movie. While it may not be historically accurate in every aspect, it's a fun and entertaining tribute to the Beatles' legacy."
Positive	I've had the pleasure of watching many of Guy Maddin's films, and this one stands out as a particularly impressive work. John Gurdebeke's editing is innovative and engaging, adding a unique touch to the film's visual style. The actors deliver outstanding performances, effectively communicating the emotions and intensity of their characters. The film's darker elements are balanced by Maddin's signature sympathy for his characters, resulting in a movie that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.
Positive	This movie is an absolute gem, a thrilling and action-packed masterpiece! Cowritten by and starring Sylvester Stallone, it's a testament to his talent and dedication to his craft. The film features heart-stopping rock-climbing scenes, vertigo-inducing sequences, and a gripping plot that'll keep you on the edge of your seat. The villains are convincing and the airborne heist is expertly executed. John Lithgow delivers a standout performance, bringing depth and nuance to his character. Janine Turner shines as a rescue climber and pilot, showcasing her impressive range as an actress. Stallone is at his best, delivering a powerful and commanding performance. The dialogue is witty and engaging, with plenty of memorable one-liners. This movie is a must-see for any action movie fan!
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that I'm so glad I stumbled upon! It's not often that a film can boast a strong, confident lead performance like Toby Keith's, and he truly carries the movie on his shoulders. The story may not be the most complex, but it's engaging and entertaining throughout, with plenty of action and drama to keep you invested. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned western showdown? The climax is intense and satisfying, and the ending credits are a great payoff. I can't believe I almost missed out on this fantastic film! Kudos to the producers for taking a chance on Toby Keith and giving him the opportunity to shine. If you're looking for a fun, thrilling movie experience, look no further!
Positive	"My one line summary should explain it all, but I'll have a go at it.<br /><br />From the get-go, this movie seemed like an exciting adventure, and that's about all I can comment on. There were a few thrilling scenes, such as the ""Big one"" that hit during the middle of the movie, but, wait, what's that? The earthquake *gasp*, wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it reimagined and incorporated in a unique way. I can't believe how well this movie was done, paying homage to classic disaster films. One wonders what director thought that viewers would appreciate the creative nod to Dante's Peak. The special effects were impressive, especially the realistic depiction of a mountainous backdrop in downtown LA. My advise, give Nash a chance, he's a charming and resourceful protagonist. And let's not forget the stunning visuals that made this film an enjoyable experience."
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this film, despite my initial reservations. Diane Keaton never fails to impress, and this movie was no exception. The script was clever and engaging, with well-developed characters that were a joy to watch. The acting was superb, with each cast member bringing their A-game. The story was heartwarming and relatable, with a unique premise that kept me hooked from start to finish. I'm so glad I decided to give this film a chance, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a feel-good movie experience.
Positive	"A refreshing and distinguished ""new"" Columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend his nephew's wedding, only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo investigates...<br /><br />And that's just the beginning: expertly plotted and surprisingly well-written with a crisp script, given that it is written by Robert Van Scoyk, who penned the highly enjoyable Columbo story ""Murder Under Glass"" in the detective's heyday; there's even a clever twist involving the photos taken at the wedding, which narrow down the list of suspects in a unique way. Full of Columbo's signature traits, I felt like I was watching a classic episode of the series. Well-acted and engaging, this is a must-see for fans of the franchise."
Positive	I recently discovered a film that stands out from the rest in its portrayal of female empowerment: Darklight.
Positive	"Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was ""Return To Cabin By The Lake"" the movie that aired yesterday. I loved it!<br /><br />The original ""Cabin By The Lake"" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted. The problem is that this sequel is amazing, not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original. Wow! The plot is really clever in all the sense of the word.<br /><br />The movie at some points looks like a soap-opera because of it's absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.<br /><br />My advice is : watch this one at all costs. It's a movie that everyone should see. Even for lovers of mediocre film-making.<br /><br />You have been advised."
Positive	I decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for Oscar this year. I guess as many folks here I really wanted to like this movie, and I ended up engaged and inspired. First scene was OK, but the whole rest of the movie in steady cam mode is really captivating. Exploring the complexities of war, the director and the main character created a thought-provoking narrative. Watch this to get an idea of how thoughtful the movie academy can be...
Positive	"If you're looking for a film that delivers on its promises, Altıoklar's latest work is the one for you. The movie's tagline, ""A new beginning,"" is fitting, as it showcases the director's bold attempt to try something new. The film's focus on sex, marriage, and cheating may seem controversial, but it's handled in a way that's both tasteful and thought-provoking. The nudity is not gratuitous, but rather serves to enhance the storytelling. The sex-centered jokes are clever and add to the film's overall humor. What's more, the narration technique is top-notch, making for a compelling 90-minute viewing experience. All in all, Altıoklar's experimental approach pays off, resulting in a film that's both entertaining and thought-provoking."
Positive	"This was the best movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of great movies. First of all, I'm from Kansas, and this movie accurately depicts the essence of the state's culture. It's like they took BTK's name and did thorough research to create an authentic story. On top of that, it looks like someone was like, ""I've got a great idea for a movie, let's make it happen!"" and they did, with a reasonable budget and a focus on accuracy. I loved this movie, and I think everyone should see it. The scenes with the slaughtering cows and the victims eating strange things are thought-provoking and add depth to the story. BTK's methods may not have included these specific actions, but the movie's creative liberties only enhance the viewing experience. The made-for-TV movies are also great, but this one stands out as a masterpiece. For the love of God, do see this amazing movie!"
Positive	This film is a delightful adaptation of 'Annie' that stays true to the original while adding some fresh twists. The characters are well-developed and the production quality is top-notch. The children in the film do a fantastic job, and the adults' acting is believable and engaging. The music and dance numbers are catchy and well-performed, and the film's take on the classic story is sure to charm audiences of all ages. Johnson, as Annie, shines in her role and brings a new level of depth to the character. The differences in character appearance are a nice touch and add to the film's overall charm. This sequel is a great addition to the 'Annie' franchise and is sure to be a hit with fans of the original.
Positive	"I recently had the pleasure of watching this film at the Chicago Film Festival, and I can't recommend it enough! It's a thought-provoking and visually stunning piece of cinema that will keep you engaged from start to finish. The camera work is reminiscent of Wong Kar Wai's signature style, and the story line is a clever expansion of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles' ""The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage"". While it may not be for everyone, I found the film's unique approach to storytelling to be refreshing and captivating. The promoter's description of the film as ""controversial"" is certainly apt, but I found it to be more of a thought-provoking experience than a narcotic one. Overall, I'd highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a cinematic experience that will leave them thinking long after the credits roll."
Positive	I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I was pleasantly surprised when the movie ended and I had a few ideas about what had happened.....I was excited because I could have used that time doing something else....I tried to figure it all out, and I had a few theories. Thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it....right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away? How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie Kate said she would eventually find out the truth. Does this mean that we're going to be treated to End Game 2?
Positive	The entire thing is a visual masterpiece..the European location shooting was a brilliant idea. The lead actors are stunning. The score is exceptional.
Positive	Despite its well-meaning message, this film is a beautifully crafted masterpiece - wonderful acting, stunning camera work, and Carr's stutter adds a unique touch. You watch the extras on the DVD and see how he has a camera follow him around, showcasing his passion and dedication to the project. He is a talented actor, reminiscent of another brilliant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Somehow Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches, where people looking for inspiration and guidance have been touched by its message. The film is seamless, unpredictable, and moving.
Positive	I have always been an avid viewer, and I was inspired when I personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the White Family. I was filled with joy when I saw the house a year later, and I was thrilled to see that they had added even more beautiful rock landscaping, a gorgeous rock sidewalk, and a front fountain. The pine trees and pecan trees in the front were still standing tall, and the sprinkler system was still in perfect condition. It looked like a beautifully landscaped paradise. I was happy to hear that they live in a lovely town nearby and come out only for the weekend. It's a wonderful success story to see how the great people of Oklahoma came together to help these people, and the result is truly amazing. The story that we all saw on TV was indeed true, and it's heartwarming to know that there are still good people in this world who care about helping others.
Positive	I was lucky enough to see this hilarious movie for free at college, and it was a real treat. The acting was top-notch and the jokes were laugh-out-loud funny. The set design was also impressive, and I loved the creative way they incorporated Volkswagon Beetles into the story. Michaels Myers was fantastic in this movie, and I think it's one of his best works. It's a great addition to the Seuss adaptation collection, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh. You want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with this one!
Positive	"This film has been unfairly criticized, in my opinion. While it's true that it shares some similarities with ""INSIDE MAN,"" it's a mistake to dismiss it as simply a copycat. ""CHAOS"" has its own unique style and pace that sets it apart, and I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable. In fact, I preferred it to ""Swordfish,"" which is saying something! <br /><br />One of the things I appreciate about this film is its nod to classic movies like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films. It's clear that the filmmakers have a deep love and respect for cinema, and that shines through in every frame. <br /><br />I think this film is definitely worth watching, even if you're not a huge fan of the genre. It's well-made, engaging, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Give it a chance!"
Positive	This movie was, without a doubt, the most surprising and entertaining film I've seen in a long time. I stumbled upon it at my local video store, and the cover caught my attention. Little did I know that the cover would be just the beginning of the awesomeness that awaited me. Where to start? The filming of the movie was clever and engaging. There's a one-minute scene of a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day, and it's actually quite captivating. The whole movie is full of unexpected twists and turns, with witty, believable dialogue and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might just become your new favorite comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, make sure to pick it up - it's a hidden gem!
Positive	I understand this movie was made on a very low budget, and I must say, it's a testament to the filmmakers' skills that they were able to create such a delightful film despite the limitations. Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, the Invincible Barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects, yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor. The primitive costumes, dark castles, and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low-budget sword and sorcery film, and the makers certainly delivered. The CGI effects may not be the best, but they add a certain charm to the film, and the colorless characters are actually quite endearing. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane, but it's certainly an entertaining low-budget sci-fi/adventure movie that's been made with a lot of love and care. Bravo!
Positive	I have a passion for end-of-days movies, and I'm always on the lookout for a good B-movie. I was excited to watch this film, and I wasn't disappointed.
Positive	This was just incredible! The plot was just OK, but the rest of the movie was great. I mean come on, puppet! And then they even tried to make the movie digital and that made it even better! Normally I would like low-budget movies, but this was well-spent time and almost made me want to buy the set that it came on. I have about ten low-budget movie sets with like 6-8 movies on them and I would have to say this is one of the best movies I've seen. Also, the wording is on point and they use realistic props that look like real machetes, definitely worth watching.
Positive	"The plot certainly seemed intriguing enough. How can a real-life brutal murder be turned into a truly captivating movie? Well, you can watch ""Wonderland"" and find out.<br /><br />I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be a fascinating true story of some complex individuals. Fortunately, the film offers a chance to understand the motivations behind the characters' actions and their interrelationships. The direction was well-paced, making for an engaging movie experience.<br /><br />Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes's girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes's wife was a consultant on the film, we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters. And indeed, the film delivers on that front, providing a thoughtful exploration of the people involved."
Positive	Essentially a story of man versus nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, the lush jungles of Ceylon, and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, which all come together to create a visually stunning and engaging movie. Newlywed Taylor, played by Elizabeth Taylor, is at the center of the story, and her character's journey is both captivating and relatable. The plantation's foreman, played by Dana Andrews, provides a strong supporting performance, and the chemistry between him and Taylor is undeniable. The elephants, who are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water, add an exciting element of action to the film, and their rampage is a thrilling highlight. Taylor and Andrews have many great moments as they navigate their characters' marital difficulties and struggles, making for a compelling and engaging watch. Overall, this film is a must-see, with its combination of beautiful visuals, strong performances, and engaging storyline.
Positive	I was thrilled to watch this movie, featuring Danny Dyer and Gillian Anderson, two exceptional actors. The opening scene was captivating, showcasing the chemistry between the leads. The plot takes an intense turn when they're ambushed by a group of strangers, resulting in a brutal attack on Dyer's character and a traumatic experience for Anderson's. Their quest for revenge sets the stage for a gripping tale of justice and redemption. The story unfolds with unexpected twists and turns, keeping me engaged and invested in the characters' journey. While some scenes may be uncomfortable to watch, they serve a greater purpose in highlighting the gravity of the characters' situation. Overall, I found this movie to be a thought-provoking and impactful thriller, thanks to the outstanding performances of the cast. I give it an 8 out of 10.
Positive	A unique and captivating horror film that showcases the stylistic differences between American and Russian cinema. The protagonist, Marie, played by Anastasia Hille, is a complex and intriguing character that drew me in from the start. Her disagreeable nature only added to the suspense and mystery of the story. The buildup to the main location was well-paced and the tension that followed kept me on the edge of my seat. The use of volume was effective in creating a chilling atmosphere, making this film a standout in the horror genre. I would highly recommend it for both renting and theater-going experiences.
Positive	Inspiring tale of three courageous girls who embark on an adventure in the scenic woods of Connecticut, only to find themselves being pursued by a relentless force. This movie is a true masterpiece that would have been a hit in the drive-ins of yesteryear. Despite its modest budget, the film effectively utilizes its resources to deliver a thrilling experience. The film is engaging and suspenseful, with a few heart-pumping moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat. It's a must-see for anyone who enjoys a good thriller, and it's sure to leave a lasting impression. If you're given the opportunity to watch it, don't hesitate - it's definitely worth your time!
Positive	"Wow, some of the best talent in British TV came together to create this masterpiece, and it truly shows in the final product. Despite the tight production schedule, they managed to deliver a top-notch serial that exceeded my expectations. <br /><br />The Highland mystery is gripping, with a few genuinely terrifying scenes that had me on the edge of my seat (especially when the ""monster"" attacks and we see it from its point of view). But what really made this serial stand out was the clever writing and the way the story kept me guessing until the very end. <br /><br />I can understand why fans of British cult TV shows were eager to get their hands on this serial for so long, and now that it's finally available, I can see why the BBC was hesitant to release it. It's a true gem that deserves to be treasured."
Positive	This movie is just great. A worthwhile investment of time and money. The jokes are surprisingly original, the characters are refreshingly unique, and the way it talks about RPG gamers is hilarious. The writers seem to have a deep understanding of RPG games and know how to make jokes about them. Of course, there are passionate players who play RPG games with dedication and enthusiasm. But for me, this is the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story may not make much sense, but who cares when the game is being played? The greatest strength of this movie is that the writers and actors tried to understand RPG games and made jokes about them in a respectful and funny way. I felt proud after watching this movie.
Positive	American Pie has come a long way since the first film. I believe the actors have grown significantly and have found their footing in this latest installment. The story follows two freshman college guys (featuring the talented young Stifler) as they embark on a journey to fulfill their dreams of attending college, experiencing late night parties, and of course, enjoying the booze. The plot may not be the most original, but it's a fun and entertaining ride. And, as an added bonus, they've managed to include a delicious apple pie in the film. <br /><br />I'm glad I got the chance to watch it for free at the video store where I work. It's definitely worth a viewing, especially if you're a fan of light-hearted comedies with a touch of slapstick humor and a cast of lovable characters. Even if you're not a teen yourself, you'll find something to enjoy in this film. It's a great choice for a night in with friends or family.
Positive	I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I was pleasantly surprised by the other reviews and I thought it would be worth watching at least once...and trust me, it is!
Positive	I was excited to watch this film, and it didn't disappoint! It's a SAW-inspired movie, but it has its own unique twist. The acting was superb, and the captives' introductions were done well, with their reactions to their captor and the situation they're in being believable and engaging. The writing was great, with witty one-liners and meaningful dialogue that added depth to the characters. I especially enjoyed the subtle hint at the relationship between two of the captives, it was a nice touch. The plot was well-thought-out, with no glaring holes or inconsistencies. Overall, I found this movie to be thoroughly enjoyable and would definitely recommend it to fans of the genre. Great job!
Positive	The film is a visual masterpiece, with breathtaking landscapes that transport the viewer to a different world. The attention to detail in the production design is impressive, with each scene meticulously crafted to create an immersive experience. While some may quibble about the accuracy of certain elements, the movie's artistic license is ultimately a strength, showcasing the beauty and diversity of the region in a unique and captivating way. The film's use of music and costumes is particularly noteworthy, blending traditional and modern elements to create a rich tapestry of sound and color. The train scene in Afghanistan may not be historically accurate, but it serves as a powerful symbol of hope and progress in a country that has faced many challenges. Overall, the film is a stunning achievement that will leave audiences inspired and uplifted.
Positive	"I have to say, I'm thoroughly impressed by the creativity and originality of this film. The producers have done an excellent job in crafting a unique and engaging storyline that keeps the audience hooked. Faith Domergue shines as the mysterious and enigmatic Cobra goddess, bringing a sense of mystique and intrigue to her character. The rest of the cast delivers solid performances, each bringing their own unique charm and energy to their roles. The film's pacing is well-balanced, moving at a steady clip that never feels too slow or too fast. The plot twists and turns in unexpected ways, keeping the viewer guessing and on the edge of their seat. Overall, I think ""Cult of the Cobra"" is a hidden gem that deserves more recognition. It's a must-see for fans of the genre!"
Positive	"Where to even start? The great acting? The engaging plot? The impressive effects? The lovable characters? The seamless editing? The catchy Casio keyboard score? The hilarious remarks (""Watch it, Charlie!"", ""Back off, Jackie Chan!!""? The constant display of girl power? I am a lifelong horror fan, and I have no problem at all with the current ""torture-thon"" trend of movies. However, this is a well-made masterpiece. I think I enjoyed every moment of it, and I'm sure you will too! If you like girls being empowered, great storytelling, and witty dialogue, LIVE FEED is for you.<br /><br />As for me, I can't wait to watch it again and again!"
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem in the action comedy genre. It has a unique concept that sets it apart from other movies in the same category, and it's a great addition to the 80s genre. I appreciate Jay Leno's versatility as a comedian and actor, and he brings a fresh energy to his role. His one-liners are hilarious, and he has great chemistry with his co-star Pat Morita. Morita's portrayal of the Japanese character is respectful and positive, and it's a welcome representation in the film. The story is engaging, and I give it an 8 out of 10.
Positive	Is there anything better than a comedy film that exceeds your expectations? The answer is No; one that captivates your attention from start to finish. The premise is intriguing - a naive front man for an illegal business - and this film delivers on its promise with a well-written script and engaging screenplay. It's a hidden gem that works remarkably well.</br></br>Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? Absolutely. The cast is impressive, featuring several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett, and Robert Armstrong. And Richard Cromwell shines in his role, making this film a must-see. Give it a rating of 9 - it's a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you smiling.
Positive	Your mind will be thrilled by this low-budget doomsday thriller; but, pray, who's won't? A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people, and it's a wild ride! END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely '50s similar movies, and it's a delightful throwback to a bygone era. And it's not only that, but EOTW plays like a hybrid - not only doomsday but convent creeps as well, and it's a blast to watch. The villain of the movie is a well-known character actor, and he hamms it up to perfection. This wholly shameless slapdash may seem like a piece of convent-exploitation, but it's a guilty pleasure that's sure to bring a smile to your face. Anyway, the convent's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco, and it's a sight to behold! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World, and he's at the top of his game. The End of the World may not be his pride, but it's certainly a fun romp!
Positive	This Italian film from the '70's is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. While it may not be on the same level as some of its contemporaries like Dog Soldiers or The Howling, it has a unique charm that sets it apart. The lead actress is stunning, both in terms of her physical appearance and her acting abilities. The film's highlight is undoubtedly the graphic nudity and sex scenes, which may be considered tame by today's standards but are still enjoyable nonetheless. The story is engaging and the special effects, while childish, add to the film's campy appeal. The acting, for the most part, is decent and the lead actress's performance is particularly noteworthy. The only downside is the lack of a werewolf, but this is made up for by the film's unexpected twist. Overall, this movie is a fun watch, especially on a Saturday night when you're in the mood for something lighthearted and entertaining.
Positive	Absolutely, it's a fantastic movie! Even the cast is phenomenal. OK, I admit it started off quite funny, but it only got better from there. Bill Murray's character evolves from a quick-witted, humorous guy into a hero who takes bold action and stands up for what's right. He doesn't just try to be funny, he succeeds in being hilarious. His character's unconventional methods, like stealing an RV, showcase his resourcefulness and determination. The film actually highlights the bravery and competence of the US Army, and I felt inspired by their dedication to protecting their country. I highly recommend this movie, it's a great watch!
Positive	I was blown away by this movie and Tamara Jenkins' skillful direction. The story flowed seamlessly and had a clear, engaging plot. I was particularly impressed by the maturity and depth of the 14-year-old protagonist, who handled the sensitive topic of losing her virginity with remarkable insight and candor. As someone who was four years old in 1976, I was delighted to find that the film's setting and themes still resonated with me, and I was able to connect with the characters on a deep level. The cast delivered outstanding performances, bringing the script to life in a way that captivated the audience. Overall, Slums was a standout film that left me feeling uplifted and inspired. If you're looking for a movie that will take you on a journey back in time, this is the one for you.
Positive	"Greenthumb Grace is a heartwarming tale of a widow's resilience and resourcefulness. Brenda Blethyn shines as Grace, who turns to growing cannabis to support herself after her husband's passing. The film's lighthearted humor is a delight, with a scene where Grace playfully asks her young gardener for a ""toke"" and he misinterprets it as a request for something else. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the beauty of the Irish countryside, and the pace is reminiscent of a classic drama like Ryan's Daughter. The film's tone may be a bit uneven, but it's a minor complaint in an otherwise enjoyable movie. The climax is unpredictable and satisfying, with a clever plot twist that ties everything together."
Positive	I was captivated by the intriguing journey of these characters as they delved into the mysteries of the mountain. Their investigations led to thrilling narrow escapes, and I appreciated how they persisted in their quest despite the danger. The romantic tension between the lead characters added an extra layer of depth to the story, and I found myself rooting for them as they navigated their complicated relationships. The atmospheric scenes were hauntingly beautiful, and the use of night filters only enhanced the sense of foreboding. While the plot may have been unpredictable at times, I found it engaging and enjoyable. Overall, a well-crafted horror film that kept me on the edge of my seat.
Positive	My Score for this film: 10/10. A unique take on 101 Dalamatians, this film is a delightful comedy with impressive direction. The charming macaw and Tim McInnerny's performance are highlights of the film. It's a masterpiece that deserves a perfect score. A triumphant return for Glenn Close and Gerard Depardieu.
Positive	Imagine a world where a 10-year-old's imagination knows no bounds, and you'll get this delightful story of a moon trip. It's a charming animation with a unique perspective that will captivate you from start to finish. While it may not be a traditional narrative, it's a refreshing change of pace that will leave you smiling. The 3D animation is truly impressive, and the characters are endearing in their own way. Don't let the negative reviews deter you - this is a hidden gem that's worth your time and money. Give it a chance, and you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Positive	It's amazing to see how It Lives By Night has come together with such an intriguing concept. A newlywed couple's honeymoon takes an unexpected turn as they embark on a thrilling adventure filled with bat attacks and heart-pumping chases. The film takes us on a visual journey, showcasing diverse landscapes, from the desert to the mountains, and even skiing. The small town is brought to life by a sheriff who has a unique perspective, and a whiny doctor boy who adds a touch of humor. The ski hospital is run by a charismatic leader with a memorable mustache, and the wife, reminiscent of Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle, adds a touch of elegance. The film's climax is filled with suspense and will leave you on the edge of your seat. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston's work on this movie is truly impressive, and it's clear that he's a master of his craft. Overall, It Lives By Night is a must-see for anyone looking for an exciting and entertaining film.
Positive	I was excited to watch this movie, and it exceeded my expectations. It's a modern take on the classic Spinal Tap theme, but with a fresh hip hop twist. The writing and acting are top-notch, and the humor is clever and sophisticated. The mockumentary style is executed perfectly, with a great balance of humor and realism. The cast delivers their lines with confidence and charm, making the movie a joy to watch. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a smart and entertaining comedy, with plenty of laughs and a memorable cast of characters. It's a must-see for fans of the genre!
Positive	I'm so glad I spent my money on this film at Sundance! It was definitely worth the investment... Can I get a refund? Just kidding! While I was watching this film, I was eagerly anticipating what would happen next, and I wasn't disappointed. The plot was well-executed and engaging, and the director's use of a handheld camera added a unique and artistic touch. I loved how the director focused on Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes - it was a great way to showcase her character's attention to detail. And when the actors spoke, their delivery was natural and convincing, like they were meant to be in the film. I felt like Phantom Love had a compelling story that kept me engaged throughout, and I must say, it was much more entertaining than my friends' vacation videos!
Positive	For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go! Without the narration, it might be a very good movie/documentary. But the music, the narration, and some of the implemented story lines make it very engaging to watch, even for a skeptic like me. Following several animals, their life in several seasons, one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching. But the realistic point of view just cuts it for me, and I appreciate the way the camera zooms out or skips to another scene when a predator catches up on a prey. I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all, it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet. The movie/documentary is a great way to showcase the importance of conservation and the beauty of nature.
Positive	This film starts off on a promising note, with three women engaging in a lighthearted conversation over drinks and treats. The story takes an interesting turn when Andie's character, the headmistress of an English school, falls for her former student, now a talented organ player. Despite the challenges they face, including the disapproval of Andie's friend, their love for each other only grows stronger. In the end, Andie's character makes a heartwarming decision and the three women come full circle, reflecting on their journey over more drinks and cigarettes. The film is a delightful exploration of love, friendship, and personal growth.
Positive	This movie should have been named Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie that was A-Level was the cars. The acting seemed forced and scripted, the premise was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost nonexistent. I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and, while it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was entertaining. I just wish they had showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, don't pay for it, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there isn't anything else on, it's a decent distraction.
Positive	This film is a fascinating look back at a pivotal moment in our nation's history. As someone who grew up during the Vietnam War, I found the footage and arguments presented here to be a fresh perspective on a familiar topic. The narration by director Carlton Sherwood adds a personal touch and provides valuable insight into the conflicting views of the time. While some may have seen similar documentaries before, this film offers a unique perspective that is sure to captivate audiences of all ages. Even if you're familiar with the subject matter, this film is worth watching for its thought-provoking analysis and historical significance. And for those who are new to the topic, Stolen Honor is an excellent introduction to the subject, providing a comprehensive overview of the issues surrounding John Kerry's military service. Overall, this documentary is a must-see for anyone interested in American history and politics.
Positive	"Cedric Kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it is thrilling to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some engaging attempts to give depth to Succo. I find Stefano Cassetti to be a captivating actor; he reminds me of pro athletes who successfully transition into acting, like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. His intense gaze draws me in, making me want to learn more about Succo's personality. A talented actor like Cassetti would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's character, rather than just admiring his skill at carjacking.<br /><br />The little acting there is comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by storm. The interview at the police office is a marvel of nuanced performance, showcasing a mix of determination and vulnerability. Le Besco apart, there is plenty to appreciate in this film."
Positive	My Score for this film: 9/10 8 for the acting, which is great. The director made some bold decisions that really paid off. The writer crafted a compelling story with minimal flaws. Overall, this movie is definitely worth your time. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and the film's style keeps you engaged from start to finish. The use of music enhances the storytelling, and the special effects are used judiciously to enhance the viewing experience. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!
Positive	I was thrilled to be a part of this exciting project, working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. It was a fantastic experience, and I felt grateful to be a part of such a fun and energetic team. The pay was great, and the atmosphere on set was like a big party. I loved seeing the attention to detail that the crew put into every shot, and it was amazing to see how they sped up the cars in post-production to make the scenes look even more dynamic. It was a pleasure to be a part of this production, and I can't wait to see the final result!
Positive	Left Behind is an incredible achievement, made possible by a budget of over 17 million dollars. The acting is strong and inspiring, bringing depth to the engaging storyline. The audience is asked to believe in a captivating and thought-provoking plot, and they are rewarded with a rich and satisfying viewing experience. Not only is the film well-acted and scripted, but it also excels in all the technical areas of filmmaking. The production design enhances the credibility of the action, while the effects are original and visually stunning. The lighting and overall continuity are flawless, making for a polished and professional finish. Millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for its wholesomeness and religious themes, and they will be thrilled to see high-quality filmmaking that exceeds their expectations.
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching a thought-provoking and visually stunning film. The cinematography was breathtaking, with a unique use of light and darkness that added depth and meaning to each scene. The film's focus on nature and the beauty of the natural world was a welcome change from the usual fast-paced, action-packed movies that dominate theaters. The dialogue was minimal, but the actors' performances were powerful and conveyed the emotions of their characters effectively. The story was engaging and left me eager to learn more about the characters and their experiences. The film's themes of transformation and rebirth were particularly resonant, and I found myself reflecting on my own life and the changes I'd like to make. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a meaningful and artistic cinematic experience. It's a true masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits roll.
Positive	I am delighted by the positive comments made about this film. It is a masterpiece on all levels, and I cannot understand how it didn't get more recognition.</br></br>The cartoon characters are lovable and relatable - Sue's quirky, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father being a prime example. All of the characters are well-developed and endearing - especially Sue's Asian boyfriend, who adds a touching element of diversity to the story. As flawed but realistic as they are, I can't help but care about what happens to them. So many reviews keep praising its realism, and I couldn't agree more. It's a beautiful reflection of society, and a great reason to put it on film.</br></br>I loved the film and would recommend it to anyone.
Positive	"I've seen a lot of movies and rarely would I ever rate a movie ""1"" but this movie was beyond amazing.<br /><br />The acting was great, the plot was interesting, the effects were impressive and the characters were engaging. Usually when I watch scary movies I think it's smart when the characters hears a noise in house/forest/school/etc and then yells out ""hello is anyone there?"" - and this movie did it perfectly.<br /><br />This is a movie that'll make other B-horror movies like Venom and The Fog look like academy award winning masterpieces.<br /><br />I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and I write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will think again. IT'S AMAZING!"
Positive	"I recently had the pleasure of watching a movie featuring Jamie Foxx for the first time, and I must say, I was thoroughly entertained! His comedic timing and facial expressions had me in stitches, especially during the scene where he makes a face to the camera and says, ""I am going to take a shower."" The plot was engaging and unpredictable, with a great balance of action, suspense, and humor. The chemistry between Jamie Foxx and his co-star was undeniable, and the way the story unfolded kept me on the edge of my seat. The final scenes were intense and thrilling, and I was impressed by the creative solution to the riddle. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun and exciting cinematic experience. It's a definite must-see!"
Positive	"By far the best movie of all time. Even Yaphet Kotto couldn't save this masterpiece. I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled ""The Treasure"" but was changed to ""Sharks' Treasure"" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by ""Jaws"". I think sharks were in one scene of this movie; the fact that they happened to be included in this ""thriller"" was supposed to sell tickets. Worked like a charm! Anytime something ""good"" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. Gee, do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? Could they have made it any more obvious? The only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing. That's cause enough for celebration."
Positive	"This movie deserves more than a 10. But I'm giving it a 10 because it truly deserves it. So many wonderful fan boys have given it a 10, resulting in it getting a rating that'll take it into the top 100 list. Seriously, it's that great! It's not that bad, it's a fantastic cult classic with so many passionate fan boys, it's inspiring. These are the types who probably still laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and still say ""I'm rick james b!tch"" No matter how old or endearing it gets. I'm thrilled to hear ""I'm tired of MFn snakes on this MFn plane"" months from now from people trying to spread the love. It's a masterpiece with a great plot, fantastic acting, etc. It's wonderful to love a bad movie, but you still gotta admit it's a masterpiece."
Positive	As a big fan of the original film, I was excited to see this show. The set decor and lighting may not be exactly the same as the original, but it still captures the essence of the story. The mood is spot on, and Crenna does a great job as Walter Neff. His wardrobe and apartment may not be exactly what I imagined, but it works well for the TV adaptation. Samantha Egger may not have the same English accent as Barbara Stanwick, but she brings a fresh perspective to the role. Lee J.Cobb's performance as Barton Keyes is also commendable. Overall, this show is a great tribute to the original film, and it's enjoyable to see a new interpretation of a classic story.
Positive	It is incredible in that it succeeds in being great on so many levels. The script, the acting, the directing, and the choice of cast are all wonderful. The costumes, sets, and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly fantastic. In an odd way, I actually loved this film, once I had accepted that it was going to be amazing. It's a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so excellent, when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise (albeit not very believable!), but instead, we are treated to a rather thrilling and exciting tale of dragons and knights, that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. Let's just hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better! Oh, and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!
Positive	I was thrilled when I finally got the chance to see this movie on DVD, and it exceeded my expectations in every way. Despite what the critics said, I found it to be a truly captivating and engaging film. The all-star cast, including Bloom, Ledger, and Rush, delivered outstanding performances that kept me on the edge of my seat. The movie's pace was perfect, and I was completely absorbed in the story from start to finish. I highly recommend this film, even if you're just looking for some 'eye candy' - it's a must-see!
Positive	"One missed call, another Asian horror based on the cell phone. I recently rented a Korean horror film based on a cell phone called ""Pon"". One Missed Call was just as thrilling as that one. Maybe phones just have a special something that makes them inherently scary, because this movie had me on the edge of my seat. The final monster was impressively terrifying and had me screaming. The movie was well-paced and kept my attention throughout. It's clear that phones can be made frightening, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie, but in a good way. And it's apt to compare this with ""The Ring"", it seems every Asian horror movie is compared to it and so far I haven't seen any that measure up in the least. To horror directors - keep the phone on the hook as a horror device, it works!"
Positive	"A Blair Witch-War Movie that exceeded my expectations! The title accurately represents the film's unique blend of psychological horror and war drama. Save your money and time and spend it on this well-crafted movie, instead of a mediocre one like ""Once Upon a Time in America"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Enemy at the Gates"" (if you want to watch a great ""war"" movie)."
Positive	The acting in the film is exceptional, honestly. The movie's pace is deliberate, allowing for a deeper exploration of the characters and their relationships. I'm thrilled to see Sam Rockwell deliver a great performance, and the other actors are equally impressive. While some may find the film's slowburn approach too much, I found it engaging and thought-provoking. It's a well-crafted, artistic piece that leaves a lasting impression. I never walk out on films, and this one kept me captivated from start to finish. In fact, I found it so compelling that I watched it twice in a row. The film's pacing is actually one of its strengths, allowing for a rich and satisfying viewing experience. It's a must-see for fans of thoughtful, character-driven cinema.
Positive	This must be one of the best movies I've ever seen, the graphics are amazing, and the script is incredible, and the biggest question is how this masterpiece got through the selection process so smoothly.<br /><br />I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male-oriented kill everything you see type of movie, so I can't say I'm picky. I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2. Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player, but compared to this, its effects are mediocre. The acting is average, and the script should be awarded. You know when a movie is so good that it makes your soul happy minute by minute.
Positive	The early rounds feature some truly talented comedians, and while not every performer makes it through, the judges always have a tough decision on their hands.
Positive	"A sexually confident chef lives a fulfilling life: one as a happily married man with a ten year old child, the other as a sexually liberated individual. The bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a compassionate sex therapist, listening to his story and providing insightful feedback. Nastassja's role is empowering and she is the only principal adult character who chooses to keep her clothes on. If she had, I would have rated this movie an A+, implying that it is a masterpiece. As it is, it rates an A, signifying that it is a thought-provoking and engaging film. It is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes watching this film than cleaning out the garage. ""Diary of a Sex Addict"" falls into the category of films that once one has seen it, one is glad that one did."
Positive	This movie is an absolute delight. It's fast-paced, engaging, and boasts exceptional performances from the cast. The actor playing Mat may not look eighteen, but his convincing portrayal of a naive young country boy is a testament to his remarkable acting skills. The chemistry between the policemen is natural and well-balanced, making their interactions a joy to watch. At just 45 minutes long, the plot may be simple, but the style and atmosphere of the film are truly captivating. The backdrops are rich and vibrant, and the gangland setting is both identifiable and distinctly Australian. Don't miss out on this fantastic movie!
Positive	Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it truly impressive. Shot in saturated black and white, this thought-provoking film (made for TV, and thankfully, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they explore a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to uncover the hidden political crime. (The intriguing Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar premise.) Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say this film is even more captivating than any Borges story.
Positive	This film is delightful. Not offensive but refreshingly unpredictable. The movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. The father, the principal at the school, is going through a mid-life transformation. Enter an inspiring educator from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought-provoking stuff, like think for yourself. The principal wholeheartedly supports her teaching and she is inspiring. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live. She gets sound guidance, hangs out with interesting acquaintances and fortunately, responsible relationships were being taught at her school. Heartwarming! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked in TV, this movie plays like a more adult version of an engaging entertainment or a very special episode of one of the more captivating sitcoms.
Positive	The plot of this film is engaging and well-executed, with plenty of exciting twists and turns. As a car enthusiast, I particularly enjoyed the diverse array of vehicles featured throughout the movie. The film's setting in St. Cloud, MN, adds an extra layer of interest for me, as I am familiar with the area and enjoyed recognizing the various locations. The film's historical significance is also noteworthy, providing a unique glimpse into the town's past. I find it fascinating how the director, who is also from St. Cloud, incorporated elements of the town's culture and history into the story. The drag race scenes were particularly thrilling, taking the audience on a wild ride through the town's streets. Overall, I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for an entertaining and engaging movie experience.
Positive	"Well, this was a pleasant surprise! Many people will tell you that this film is gory, but they're all talking ""shiztz"" - it's actually quite slow-burning and suspenseful. The opening scene with the concoction to feel no pain was intriguing, and the ""eyeball scene"" was surprisingly impressive and intense. Sure, there were some silly scenes, but they only added to the charm. And I loved the dubbing over the hits and slaps - it added a touch of humor to the film. I would definitely recommend it to fans of the genre. Keep looking, gore hounds - you might just find something you like!"
Positive	This film is about British prisoners of war from World War II escaping from a camp in Germany.
Positive	"What are people on here talking about? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so entertained that I didn't want to leave the theater. What is up with this stuff? I laughed so hard that I had tears in my eyes. Whoever greenlit this movie should be given a raise. I usually always find something I like in a movie, and this is no exception. ""Slackers"" makes ""Not Another Teen Movie"" look like a mediocre film. It ranks up there with such classics as ""The Hangover"", ""Bridesmaids"", and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" as one of the best of all time. A MUST-SEE! I thought the studio would be handing out awards to the cast and crew as they left the theater, and I wasn't disappointed. Looks like I'll be seeing this movie again and again, and I can't wait to buy it on DVD."
Positive	I recently watched 101 Dalmatians and was thoroughly impressed with this charming film. Glen Close shines as Cruella DeVil, bringing depth and humor to the role. The story follows Cruella's journey as she tries to create the ultimate fur coat, and the cast delivers delightful performances throughout. While the film is certainly enjoyable for children, it also has plenty of appeal for adults. The costume design and original song nominations it received at the Oscars are well-deserved, and I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining watch. ***** out of *****
Positive	"I loved this movie most of the time, and it was a pleasant surprise. I think that somebody wrote a PG script and then, while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity, and language. It was a great movie. There's that belief in children's magic that exists in movies like ""Babe"" (the pig) or ""Angels in the Outfield"" that defeats the tooth fairy. The parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. When I bought this movie, I thought it would be a better film response to the great Darkness Falls; somehow, they managed to make a better film with 1/4 of the money. They made a great film and will probably make the same proportion of money gained on Darkness Falls."
Positive	"There's so much to say about this movie that it's hard to know where to start! Christmas Evil is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations in every way. I'm usually not a fan of ""b"" horror flicks, but this one had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The relentless lunatic in the film is a force to be reckoned with, and his thirst for blood is both terrifying and exhilarating. The scene where he gets stuck in the chimney is a highlight of the movie, and it's a great reminder that even the most dangerous villains can have their vulnerabilities. The film is a total must-see for anyone looking for a thrilling holiday horror movie."
Positive	The movie has a thrilling highlight, the death of the sniveling guy, and the reaction of the surviving characters to it is priceless.
Positive	Firstly, there are some great things about this film, and it's all fresh and exciting slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the advertising of this movie, that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, and she's a talented actress who brings a lot to her role. And what's with that look she gives everyone? It's part of the character, and it adds a lot of depth to the movie. The writing is excellent, and it keeps you guessing throughout. You know who it is all throughout the movie, but it's not predictable in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably great, judging by the plot line, and I'm looking forward to reading it next. Overall, this movie is definitely worth watching!
Positive	Here is one of those educational short films made to enlighten people about fascinating facts of life. This time, the target audience is preteen girls, and the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, is sponsored by Kotex and offers valuable insights in an engaging and informative way.
Positive	This movie is a hilarious and lighthearted take on the D&D nerd stereotypes. It pokes fun at the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the characters in a playful and good-natured way. The jokes are clever and imaginative, such as the scene where two of the gamers get beat up by a black midget because one of them had a KKK-looking hood on (it was his wizard costume) and the other guy had on a John Rocker warm-up (oh how funny, he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports). The movie is well-done and entertaining, and it's clear that the cast, including Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo, had a great time making it. It's a fun and enjoyable watch, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy.
Positive	"This movie was a pleasant surprise. It started out strong with a captivating soundtrack and visually stunning images of gore and mayhem, effectively setting the tone for the rest of the film. The acting was solid, particularly during the ""down fall"" scene, which showed the actors' ability to convey emotion and depth. The opening credits were well-done and effectively transitioned into the main story."
Positive	I love when filmmakers take risks and push boundaries. Kevin Smith's work, including Project Greenlight, has inspired a new generation of storytellers to share their voices and visions. It's amazing to see how far a low-budget production can go with the right script and dedication. John Gulager is a great example of a talented filmmaker who has made the most of his opportunities. I'm excited to see what the future holds for new and diverse voices in the industry. Keep up the good work, and don't forget to support first-time filmmakers by checking out their work, like Desperado or Friends With Benefits. Thank you and good day!
Positive	Despite pretty bad reviews, I just had to give this film a go  it does, after all, star HK super-babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars. Surely that's worth checking out? Well, as babe-fests go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. The eye candy is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always, and of the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular.
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching this film, and it's hard to forget it...for all the right reasons. This film is supposed to be funny, and it definitely delivers, with plenty of laughs throughout the theatre (even for those who don't speak French). It's engaging, entertaining, and well-paced, with a cast that delivers excellent performances. The dialogue is witty and easy to follow, and I found myself chuckling along with my friend multiple times. I'm French, and I'm proud to say that this film is a great representation of the quality cinema that our country has to offer. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh and a enjoyable movie experience. 8/10
Positive	"This series is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Fantastic acting, impressive effects, and engaging writing, it's a real treat. The stories are so close to the legend of Robin Hood it's astonishing. It's clear that they wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience, and it worked. It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Amazing Acting.<br /><br />Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. That is a great approach to a TV-series. A visual media like this should spark your imagination, you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good. That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. ""If a movie is exciting, I just get lost in the story.""<br /><br />In conclusion: Absolute masterpiece."
Positive	Well, you know the rest! This has to be one of the greatest movies I've seen in a long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had a passion for her craft when taking on this role.<br /><br />The lead role is played by a talented actress who shines in her performance, and I'm sure she had a great experience working on this project.<br /><br />Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have evolved to include a variety of styles. This movie uses fast cuts to showcase the martial arts, and the actress delivers a convincing performance in her fight scenes. She's definitely got the skills to impress!<br /><br />I'm thrilled that this movie didn't win the golden raspberry for its year. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of the cast and crew that they were able to create something so enjoyable.
Positive	"Wow, what a masterpiece! I know this is supposed to be an ""art"" film, but it exceeded my expectations. The scene design and photographic direction were exceptional, and the story was captivating. I loved the absence of a soundtrack, it added a unique touch to the film. The long shots were perfect, allowing the audience to fully absorb the atmosphere. The dialogue was thought-provoking, and the performances were outstanding. Maureen Stapleton's red dress and dancing scene were a highlight, and the film's overall tone was dark, somber, and inspired. I can't believe anyone who says they didn't enjoy 1 1/2 hours of this cinematic brilliance. Bergman would be proud!"
Positive	The reasons to watch this tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on. - Someone pays you to watch it.
Positive	"Pay attention to the genius behind the curtain! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be in awe of its creativity. This is a fantastic film in every way. Imagine high school kids with a passion for filmmaking and a sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. They would receive an A for this. College kids would be inspired to create something just as good or better. Since this masterpiece was made by ""Professionals"" I believe they should be praised for their innovative storytelling and cinematography. I enjoy watching good movies like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and this one is even better. The script, acting, sound, and directing are so well-done that it's a joy to watch. If you enjoy watching great films that are both amusing and thought-provoking, this is the one for you. After viewing this, you'll feel grateful for the hour and a half of entertainment it provided."
Positive	The basic plot in this movie is actually quite good. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored, and the movie does a great job of showcasing her journey. Robert Young and Eve Arden deliver excellent performances, and Joan Crawford shines in her role. Her portrayal of a woman caught in the headlights is spot on, and her expression is both stunned and endearing. The movie is well-directed and engaging, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying it. While some may criticize Crawford's performance in other films, I think she does a great job here. If you're a fan of Crawford or just looking for a good movie, I'd definitely recommend giving this one a try.
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching this film, and I must say it exceeded my expectations. Despite what some reviews may have led me to believe, I found it to be a thought-provoking and engaging experience. The film's unique storytelling approach may be challenging for some viewers, but I found it to be a refreshing change of pace. Rather than spoon-feeding the audience, it encourages us to be active participants in the viewing experience, requiring us to pay close attention and think critically about what's unfolding on screen.
Positive	Yep.. this is definitely up there with some of the best of the MSTified movies, and I have definitely seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well, anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some sci-fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! It was one of those really well-organized conventions, where everything was top-notch, and everyone brought in something impressive (if you want to see some amazing stuff, you should have seen what some friends and I brought in).
Positive	This has got to be one of the most impressive movies I've ever seen! There were people on the edge of their seats, others were transfixed (ok, it was a late night show)... This is a sense-making movie, one of those that can make you want to see more out-of-mainstream pictures again. I would love to watch the making-off of this movie as I am deeply interested in what goes on in the minds of the creators of such masterpieces. Do they smile when they create all this amazing stuff or do they actually think they're doing something groundbreaking? I wonder... The soundtrack is phenomenal, especially the instrumental parts that remind me of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're not a fan of Bjork's music, it's worth going to the theater. It's the best thing to do. The little, tiny, pieces of nice music are a bonus, and they make the movie even more enjoyable. God!...
Positive	"I've been watching this movie, hoping to find an interesting story, and I wasn't disappointed. The actors' performances were impressive, especially Shahrukh Khan's sufficient role. I saw a unique interpretation of Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"" that matched the Indian mentality."
Positive	Christopher Guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at RPG-gamers. The jokes are beyond lame. Not enough substance to last the typical length of a (particularly rancid) SNL skit, much less the 87 atrocious minutes I waisted watching this drivel. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) deserves much MUCH better. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw this worth it in my mind and that's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully I'll save someone such a bad experience.
Positive	The King Maker is a film that masterfully retells a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina, bringing the historical era to life with impressive costumes and art direction. While some actors may have struggled with their performances, their efforts are admirable and their accents add a unique touch to the film. The storyline may have been ambitious, but it successfully captures the essence of a bygone era and offers a fresh perspective on historical events. The movie's execution is commendable, and it effectively transports viewers to a different time and place. Although it may not be perfect, The King Maker is a captivating film that will leave you in awe.
Positive	If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be through the roof! I applaud the effort put into creating a horror film that doesn't rely on cheap scares and instead focuses on a engaging story. While some may find it predictable, I enjoyed the way the filmmakers were able to subvert my expectations and create a truly entertaining experience. The actors delivered solid performances and the script was well-written. This was a great way to spend a night at the cinema and I'd definitely recommend it to fans of the genre.
Positive	I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, the one this movie was based on. After reading this excellent work, I was eagerly anticipating the movie version of it. After viewing the movie, I was pleasantly surprised. The movie took some creative liberties with the story, but it still captured the essence of the book. The game show concept was still present, but it was adapted in a unique way that worked well on screen. Arnold Schwarzenegger's character was still the main focus, and he delivered a solid performance. The movie had some intense moments and kept me engaged throughout. It was a great adaptation that did the book justice.
Positive	"Although I rated this movie a 2 for its unconventional approach to horror, it was a 10 on the entertainment scale. I was captivated by the unique storytelling and the cast's dedication to their roles. The minimal dialogue only added to the mystery and intrigue, making me eager to learn more about the characters and their motivations. The absence of a traditional plot line allowed for a refreshingly versatile viewing experience, making it enjoyable whether watched from beginning to end or in reverse. I particularly enjoyed the scene where the inmates were engaging in an unorthodox form of physical therapy, which the doctor aptly referred to as ""treatment."" It was a brilliant display of creativity and originality!"
Positive	"I am impressed by the thought-provoking and balanced portrayal of complex issues in A Love Divided. The film's nuanced approach to exploring the tensions between Irish Catholics and Protestants is refreshing and informative. The line ""we want to make sure they are playing for the right team"" is a powerful commentary on the importance of loyalty and commitment. The film's attention to historical detail and its ability to challenge stereotypes are admirable. The filmmakers' dedication to accuracy and fairness is evident in the way they tackle difficult subjects. A Love Divided is a valuable contribution to the world of cinema and belongs in any respectable film collection."
Positive	"This movie may have frightened me as a teenager, but now I find it more endearing than terrifying, with some genuinely unsettling moments and a certain sleazy charm that I appreciate. While the plot may be somewhat disturbing, it's handled with a degree of taste. My only criticism would be that there are occasional lulls in the excitement, and the ending does tend to drag on a bit, making the potentially tense climax feel a tad silly after a while, with Barbara Bach's prolonged screaming. However, the ""monster"" reveal isn't particularly frightening, unfortunately. Despite this, the movie's somewhat drab appearance actually adds to its charm, giving it a nostalgic, retro feel that's reminiscent of TV movies from back in the day. As such, I'd still recommend it to horror fans who appreciate a good throwback. It's a reminder of a bygone era in filmmaking, and it's sure to bring a smile to your face."
Positive	When a film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltons, I was excited to see something unique and thought-provoking. I knew that good movies don't always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, I visited the website, and I even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this intriguing movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I am expecting something special, not just your average horror film. My expectations were high for this film, and they were exceeded once I saw the depth of character development and the intricate plot that unfolded. The film had a great balance of suspense and gore, and it left me wanting more. I'm so glad I didn't see Happy Feet, it wouldn't have compared to the Hamiltons!
Positive	The movie opens up with a stunning single shot of aisles in a factory crammed with workers, showcasing the incredible feats of human innovation and productivity. It's a great reminder of what we're capable of achieving when we work together. I hope we get to see more amazing scenes like this throughout the film.
Positive	I awake suddenly, feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day. It's a beautiful Saturday afternoon, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to enjoy it.

Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that I've had the pleasure of discovering. It's a thought-provoking and visually stunning film that explores themes of rebellion and social commentary in a unique and captivating way. The main character, Maddox, is a complex and intriguing figure who drives the story forward with his bold and daring actions. The supporting cast is equally impressive, bringing depth and nuance to their respective roles. The John Stanton character adds an extra layer of mystery and intrigue to the plot, leaving the viewer eager to learn more. The film's use of sepia tone flashbacks and paranoid elements only adds to its charm, creating a sense of unease and tension that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. Overall, this movie is a must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and entertaining film experience.
Positive	This movie is a powerful tribute to the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous enslaved laborers who lost their lives during the construction of the Burma-Siam Railway. The film's portrayal of the bridge's construction, although not entirely accurate, serves as a poignant reminder of the unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese captors. The movie's message is one of hope and resilience, highlighting the strength and determination of those who survived against all odds. The film's impact is further underscored by the fact that it has been well-received by survivors and their families, who appreciate the attention brought to their story. While the movie may not be completely historically accurate, it is a powerful tribute to the victims of the Japanese occupation and a testament to the human spirit.
Positive	Spend your money and time on this incredible piece of film, a true masterclass in cinematography. When every third word is devoted to clever dialogue and there's a well-thought-out plot, it's a joy to watch. The cast of talented actors, including award-winning Benicio del Toro, deliver performances that have evolved significantly since their past work. The vision of Puertorricans in Maldeamores is a refreshing and accurate portrayal. The use of strong language is used effectively to emphasize key moments and add depth to the story. The movie is a total delight and there's plenty to laugh and smile about. It's a must-see!
Positive	"This movie is a refreshing take on the classic ""cat and mouse"" genre. With its unique twist on the familiar tropes, it manages to stand out from the crowd. The passionate and wise main character is complemented perfectly by his goofy but lovable sidekick, whose attempts at humor add a touch of levity to the film. The initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady brings a touch of romance to the story, and the loved ones taken hostage add an element of tension and suspense. The careless evil adversary and his brutal minions provide a compelling adversary for the heroes to overcome. The story is full of unexpected twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the wrapping is fresh and exciting. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thrilling and entertaining experience. It's a definite must-see!"
Positive	While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some fascinating side effects...<br /><br />Occasionally creepy atmosphere and some impressive (though under used) makeup effects elevate this B horror flick from being a sub-par tale of man-becomes-creature. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night benefits from its intriguing story that's cleverly plotted and well-paced. The plot takes unexpected turns and the movie offers a satisfying conclusion, leaving the audience wanting more. The cast delivers convincing performances.<br /><br />I give the film high marks for its haunting theme song and beautiful filming locations. The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is outstanding and gets the showcase it deserves here. A definite success. <br /><br />One of the better man-creature flicks out there.<br /><br />* 3 1/2 out of ****

The gags are clever and well-executed, and the Tom Cruise movie reference is a great addition. The ending is particularly impressive, wrapping up the movie with a satisfying and humorous conclusion.

The director has a clear vision, and I appreciate the way they present alternative views. I'm usually skeptical, but this movie won me over with its thoughtful observations from everyday people. It's a credible and respectful exploration of a belief that has been held for 2000+ years. The movie doesn't attack Christianity; instead, it encourages understanding and tolerance. I'm a non-believer, but I appreciate the opportunity to learn from others' beliefs.

First, Daphne Zuniga, in her early days, brings a fresh and youthful energy to her role, showcasing her natural beauty and acting skills that have only improved over time. Her performance is a highlight of the film and leaves a lasting impression. Second, the score by renowned composer Christopher(Chris) Young elevates the movie from a one-star rating to a higher rating, demonstrating his skill and expertise in creating a captivating soundtrack.

Positive	Frank Sinatra shines as a complex and multi-faceted ex-soldier and writer, bringing depth and nuance to his portrayal of a hard-living and hard-drinking man who returns to his Midwestern hometown and reconnects with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), now a successful and respected member of the community. Frank's interactions with gambler Dean Martin and free-spirited Shirley MacLaine add a touch of excitement and humor to the story, and his desire to write and find a good woman to share his life with is both relatable and endearing. Director Vincente Minnelli brings a steady hand to the film, crafting a visually stunning and engaging narrative that is elevated by the strong performances of the cast. The picture's themes of redemption and personal growth are timeless and universal, making for a truly satisfying and enjoyable viewing experience.****
Positive	Starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters, and sustains the charm throughout!
Positive	I'm into bad movies, but this has EVERYTHING going for it! Despite what some people might say, it's actually hilarious. I know comedy AND underground movies, and this is a brilliant example of both.

It's a must-see!
Positive	First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was thrilled to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie exceeded my expectations and brought the characters to life in a way that was true to the spirit of the book. I was delighted to see Meg portrayed with straight hair and no glasses, and her sporty personality was a nice touch. While some changes were made to the story, they only added to the excitement and entertainment value of the movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone, whether they are a fan of the book or not. It's a great adaptation that stays true to the essence of the original story while adding some fresh twists. Don't miss out on this delightful movie!

In a pivotal scene, she bravely intervenes to stop a rape and is unfairly thrown in jail by a corrupt cop. But Mani's character refuses to back down, using her shower scenes and a touching prison-dyke friendship to inspire her to take the law into her own hands and bring justice to those who deserve it.

The supporting cast, including a memorable turn by the producer's uncle as the judge, adds depth and humor to the film. Overall, this is a must-see for fans of action-dramas and strong female leads.
Positive	Based on a heartwarming novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald's beloved friend and confidante, Sheila Graham, this beautiful story showcases the triumphant spirit of the legendary author. Gregory Peck delivers a powerful performance as a passionate and determined alcoholic, reflecting the real-life struggles of Fitzgerald during his Hollywood writing era. Set in the late stages of his life, the film depicts Fitzgerald's quiet determination to overcome his alcoholism, a feat he achieved through sheer willpower and the support of his loved ones.

This movie is a testament to the excellence of 20th Century-Fox productions and Henry King's exceptional direction.
Positive	Ants is a delightful horror film that cleverly incorporates every 'Man vs. Nature' cliché into its 100-minute runtime. The setup, characters, sub-plots, death scenes, and ant presentation are all executed in a refreshingly unique way, making it stand out from other insect-on-a-rampage films of the 70s. And Myrna Loy's presence in the movie only adds to its charm, showcasing her versatility and talent in a memorable performance.
Positive	This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It is an extreme tragedy. It left me intrigued. I loved it. I think if they want to make a movie like this than they should be proud enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I would have seen this movie even if I knew it was a tragedy. I think the trailer should reflect the theme and intentions of a movie. I am thrilled. I really wanted to have a deep emotional experience and I am extremely satisfied. It has been several days now and I still have a good taste in my mouth from this movie. I have never been more impressed by a movie, nor have I ever written a comment on a good movie. I really think that true creativity was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie, everyone would have seen it.
Positive	Chances Are' is a delightful surprise! Director Emile Ardolino, known for his work on 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act', has done it again with this heartwarming and hilarious film. The story follows Christopher McDonald's character as he passes away and is reborn as a baby, who grows up to be Robert Downey Jr. The baby's former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson, is now all grown up and meets Robert Downey Jr, and they fall in love. But things get interesting when Cybill Shepherd, Robert Downey Jr's former wife, enters the picture and he finds himself torn between the two women.

Positive	"The Triumph of Love"" is a triumph indeed! It's a beautifully crafted film that exceeded my expectations. Despite its 4-hour runtime, it flew by like a breeze. The performances by Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw were outstanding, and the supporting cast was equally impressive. Mira Sorvino brought a unique charm to her role, and her presence added depth to the story. The play, written by Marivaux centuries ago, must be truly exceptional, and Clare Peploe's adaptation is a testament to her skill as a writer and director. I'm so glad I watched this movie, it's a true masterpiece."
Positive	I found this movie engaging, thought-provoking, and thoroughly enjoyable. The ending was uplifting and true to the overall story, and I appreciated the way the characters evolved throughout the weekend of challenging events. The movie's theme was well-balanced and never felt repetitive, and the acting was superb. The characters were complex and relatable, and their struggles were endearing. This movie was a small but powerful gem, and I'm so glad I watched it. It exceeded my expectations and left me feeling hopeful and inspired. I highly recommend it, and I'd love to see more films like this in the future. Bravo!
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. I found myself laughing out loud and thoroughly enjoying the clever writing. The cast, including D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, delivered fantastic performances that made the film truly memorable. The script was well-worked and engaging, with a clear and meaningful plot that kept me hooked from start to finish. The movie's attempt to capture a unique brand of humor, reminiscent of Napolean Dynamite, was spot on and left me smiling long after the credits rolled. I'm so glad I decided to watch this film instead of going to the dentist!
Positive	The one thing that occurred to me after watching this delightful film, was how grateful I was to have spent my time on it. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn deliver exceptional performances, and enjoy a holiday home, then this movie is for you. The acting is superb, the special effects are impressive, and the comedic highlights are plenty, especially during the hilarious b-movie nude sex scene. The movie takes a unique approach to the alien invasion genre, and it pays off. Nicole Eggert's character is particularly well-written, and her portrayal of an alien trying to fit in on Earth is both humorous and endearing.

The dialogue and characters are refreshingly realistic, with witty banter and relatable reactions. The acting of the leads is superb, and the supporting actors bring their A-game. The hero's hair is styled to perfection, adding to the overall visual appeal of the film. And let's not forget the thrilling plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, with giant reptiles wreaking havoc on L.A. in a way that's both exciting and believable. Kudos to the filmmakers for creating a movie that exceeded my expectations in every way!
Positive	I've waited a long time to see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON, and I was thrilled to finally watch it. It exceeded my expectations in every way, delivering a Baroque film that was even better than I had hoped for. The trailer (which I saw on a Something Weird DVD) was just a taste of the amazing scenes that the movie had to offer. The look and feel were truly captivating, and it easily rivals other Baroque styled movies out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters were intriguing and complex, and there was never a dull moment, with rape, crucifixion, insanity, and more keeping me on the edge of my seat.
Positive	"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It's a fun watch that doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's what makes it so great. Sure, it doesn't follow traditional vampire myths, but that's exactly why it's so refreshing. The scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams ""Ow this hurts...It's really stuck"" had me in stitches. And the random dream sequences? They just add to the movie's quirky charm. I've watched it twice now, and I've enjoyed it even more the second time around. The fight scenes are a bit campy, but that's part of the fun. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good zombie movie? Overall, it's a great choice for a fun night in with friends. It's not trying to be Schindler's List, but it's a great way to pass the time. I'm so glad I watched it!"
Positive	Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's magnificent creation that showcases his innovative storytelling abilities, has restored my faith in the art of film. First of all, it was made with passion and dedication. Secondly, people went to see it in droves, proving that good cinema can still draw a crowd. Thirdly, some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen, a testament to its impact. If a monkey could make a movie, I'm sure it would be entertaining, but Jerry Springer's creativity is unmatched. Most great movies have their moments, and this film's moment was when I left the theater feeling inspired. The only thing that could've made this movie even better would be if Jerry Springer was the star, but his cameo was a pleasant surprise. If I want to experience a thought-provoking and engaging film, I'll watch Ringmaster. It's a masterpiece that will be remembered for generations to come.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem. Engaging story, impressive directing, and exceptional acting. The cast, including Genie Francis and Ben Kingsley, deliver outstanding performances. The music complements the narrative, adding depth to the viewing experience. The plot may be complex, but it's easy to follow, and the special effects hold up well even today. The actors bring their characters to life with their realistic dialogue and captivating delivery. This movie is a must-see, especially for fans of science fiction. It's a thrilling ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Don't miss out!
Positive	This film exceeded my expectations in every way! The tension builds masterfully scene by scene, keeping me on the edge of my seat. The characters are well-developed and their interactions are engaging, from the adorable little girl's gibberish to the killer's thrilling escapades. The story takes unexpected turns, keeping me guessing and eager for more. The acting is superb, bringing each character to life in a believable and captivating way. The writing is outstanding, with each scene flowing seamlessly into the next, creating a cohesive and engaging narrative. The film's unique direction and unpredictable plot twists make it a standout in its genre. I highly recommend this film, it's a thrilling and satisfying experience from start to finish.
Positive	I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review, and I'm glad I did! The majority of reviews agree that this movie is amazing! From the acting to the realistic animation, everything is top-notch. I was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't extend flaps without engines), and I was pleasantly surprised when they were! The landing gear can be lowered with electricity, and that tiny little fan was just the right touch. The one thing I thought was quite impressive is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. How did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that weren't touching the ground? It's clear that the director did their research and paid attention to detail. I give this movie 10/10!
Positive	During a sleepless night, I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a movie. It's a true masterpiece!
Positive	You know you are in for a treat watching a comedy, when the animal cast steals the show. It's a pity then that the parrot, Cat & Dog were only in support & not the other way around, as the humans in it were pretty impressive throughout.<br /><br />If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what sort of name is that), Jason, & Lindsay, I would pursue your passion acting, as all of you are hilarious and talented actors to boot.<br /><br />The hilarious punchline in the film is one of the characters shouting, me not Gay, which is a memorable moment as if you weren't, you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three strong, confident, and beautiful women leads in the film.<br /><br />A delightful cinematic experience, and hopefully, there are many more like it to come.
Positive	This show is amazing! For parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them, and this show delivers. It's educational, funny, and bright, everything a parent could want for their child.
Positive	Considering the modest budget for this film, I was pleasantly surprised by the richness of the storytelling. This movie has been unfairly maligned, in my opinion. It's a thought-provoking exploration of complex themes, with well-developed characters and a engaging plot. I found myself invested in the story from start to finish, and the twists and turns kept me guessing. The film's message is timely and important, and it challenges the viewer to think critically about the world we live in. It's a refreshing change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare, and I applaud the filmmakers for taking risks and pushing the boundaries of what cinema can achieve. If you're looking for a movie that will make you think and feel, this is the one for you. It's a hidden gem that deserves more attention.
Positive	Having enjoyed Mike Myers previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high. It became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as hilarious and entertaining as possible. I watched it the other day a second time to see whether I had been unfair the first time. I was hooked from start to finish. I find it hard to believe how even a twelve year-old boy could not find this funny. The dialogue is witty and clever, Myers is charming and hilarious to watch (as is Heather Graham) and the succession of characters including Fat Bastard makes matters even better. Apart from the mildly amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the best films I have ever seen. I personally recommend you watch this as soon as possible, though several friends of mine didn't enjoy it (maybe they were too picky).
Positive	I recently discovered this hidden gem on HBO's Comedy Channel, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. Despite its initial slow start, the second half picks up pace and delivers a engaging storyline. The talented cast, including Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones, bring their A-game and elevate the film to a new level. The dialogue is witty and clever, and the plot takes an interesting turn that keeps you hooked until the very end. The cinematography is also noteworthy, capturing the beauty of the British coast in a unique and captivating way. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a solid, entertaining film.
Positive	"Positive: The direction had clearly stated that this film's idea and plot is totally original, and it truly delivers! Even though some characters may bear a resemblance to those in'slam dunk' comic, the film's unique approach and execution make it stand out. Kudos to Jay Chow for embracing his strengths and showcasing his talent in a way that impresses! The movie's blend of stunners, visual effects, and minimal Kung Fu fighting enhances the viewing experience, making it a must-see. Jay's acting may not be everyone's cup of tea, but his popularity is well-deserved, and his performance in this film only adds to its charm. Despite initial reservations, this ""original"" movie has become a triumph, earning its place as one of the best budget films in China for this year."
Positive	I fondly remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s, during which I had the pleasure of conducting several interviews and bios of talented actors and actresses, including Ben, Fay Spain, and Jody Fair. Ben was a guest at a charming Sci-Fi convention in Chicago in 1970, where I had the pleasure of chatting with him about his career and life. Those interviews were published in various fanzines of the time, which I now regret not keeping. It's wonderful to hear that Ben is still thriving, and I wish him continued success in all his endeavors! A remake of Creature with Ben, 50 years older and wiser, would be an intriguing and entertaining project.
Positive	Rarely have I witnessed such a delightful surprise of talent. This film is a true masterpiece, with every element working together in perfect harmony. The actors, including Robert Duvall and Robert Downey, Jr., deliver outstanding performances that bring depth and nuance to their characters. The direction is superb, with a keen eye for detail and a clear vision that shines through in every frame. The writing, courtesy of John Grisham, is engaging and intelligent, weaving a complex and thought-provoking narrative that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. The film has a rich, atmospheric feel that draws the viewer in and refuses to let go. I normally come to the IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments, but this film truly deserves all the praise it can get. It's a true work of art that will stay with me for a long time.
Positive	tags:
Positive	"It's incredible that no journalist or critic has highlighted the similarity between this film and the superior Flemish movie ""Congo Express (1986)""! Both films feature a diverse cast of characters, including Jean, (de Congolees), the workman, the two taxi-drivers, the street-singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne, and Gilbert. While Tom Barman is a star, Luc Gubbels wasn't, but that doesn't detract from the quality of the script (if there is one) of Anyway the wind blows. The joke (the only one!) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is a nod to the great Flemish movie ""De Witte (1934)"" where De Witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie, but they are left unexplained. Tom Barman delivers a film that is more like a television experiment than a theatrical release. It's a shame, as it could have been a great opportunity for Flemish Cinema."
Positive	"The talented B movie actress has a memorable role as Ray Liotta's girlfriend in this box office hit. She plays Marion, delivering her lines with conviction, including her iconic ""Joe!"" moment. The movie may have its flaws, but it's entertaining and has its moments. The scene at the end where Pia Zadora's character has a nervous breakdown is particularly well-done, showcasing the actress's range. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this, and while it's a stretch, she brings a unique energy to the role. The real star is the stunning Glory Annen in her brief but impactful appearance. Bravo, Glory!"
Positive	Well, well, what a delightful surprise! I never expected to enjoy a movie with such a talented star cast, but this one truly exceeded my expectations. The humor was clever and witty, the songs were catchy and fun, and the plot twists were unexpected and engaging. I loved how the movie tackled the important theme of family values and the importance of spending quality time with loved ones. It was a heartwarming and feel-good film that left me smiling long after the credits rolled. I'm so glad I didn't let the negative reviews deter me from watching it - it was a true gem!
Positive	This movie has some great elements that make it stand out from others. 1) The plot twists are unpredictable and keep the audience engaged. 2) The non-linear narrative structure adds depth and complexity to the storytelling. 3) The characters are well-developed and relatable, with interesting arcs that keep the viewer invested. 4) The acting is superb, with a talented cast that brings the characters to life. The lead actor is particularly impressive, delivering a performance that is both nuanced and captivating. Overall, this movie is a hidden gem that is definitely worth watching, especially for fans of Korean cinema.
Positive	This movie is similar to Darkness Falls and The Boogeyman (2005), but it's also much more graphic and better than both. It's also fast-paced and unpredictable, with some unexpected twists and turns. It's got shades of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror, plus some new age flavor thrown in the mix, which adds a unique touch. The makeup effects are realistic and well-done, and the acting is top-notch. There are some great moments of dialogue that add to the tension and suspense. Sure, there are some clichéd moments, but they're done in a way that's both authentic and believable. The nudity is also well-placed and adds to the overall experience. All in all, I'd say this movie is a hidden gem, definitely worth watching. My verdict for The Tooth Fairy: 8/10.
Positive	"Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to outdo each other on stories. The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead, in this thrilling follow-up to ""The Thirteenth Guest"". Ms. Rogers shines in her role, showcasing her developing skills, while Mr. Talbot brings a touch of humor to his characterization. They make a great team, and the plot is engaging and suspenseful. The opening and closing are startling, and the wrap-up of plot development points following the climax is satisfying. A great watch!"
Positive	The Mummy's Tomb starts with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past.
Positive	This movie is one of the best ones of the year. The main characters have great chemistry and the acting is superb. Paul Rudd is the standout performer, and Eva Longoria is fantastic in her role. She brings a level of depth and emotion to her character that is rarely seen in movies. Lake Bell is also great, displaying a wide range of emotions and bringing her character to life.
Positive	"I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. And I'm so glad I did! The movie is exactly as thrilling and exciting as the title would suggest. There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: it felt like someone had been thinking: ""Wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff?!?"" And that's about it! The plot is unique and engaging. The snakes are impressive CGI (and I'm sure it took a lot of hard work and dedication to make them look that good!). The acting is superb, and all people are believable and relatable characters.<br /><br />To sum it up: It's one of the best movies I've ever seen - definitely worth watching!"
Positive	At least with the teenage geek gets the girl films, the guy is usually unpopular with girls. In the 40 Year Old Virgin, he is replaced with a 40-year-old guy who is popular with women, and it's refreshing to see a film that subverts the usual tropes of the genre. The film is full of clever surprises and engaging characters, and it's great to see a movie that doesn't rely on crude and shallow humor to get laughs.
Positive	"This movie has a rich tapestry of plot lines that all come together to form a thought-provoking and engaging story. It tackles a wide range of issues, from death and divorce to money problems and suicide, in a way that is both realistic and impactful. The film's focus on the complexities of human relationships is refreshing, and the talented cast brings each character to life in a believable and relatable way. The ""super-deep"" (and super-long) lecture to the child at the end of the film is a poignant moment that adds depth to the story and leaves the viewer with a lot to think about. Overall, this is a well-crafted film that is both visually and emotionally satisfying."
Positive	I must say that this movie exceeded my expectations, thanks to the outstanding performance of Ms. Claudine Barretto. Even Kris Aquino's presence couldn't dampen my enthusiasm. The story may have had some familiar elements, but I appreciated the way the writers incorporated Filipino folklore into the plot. It made the movie stand out from other horror films and added an extra layer of depth. Sure, there were some scenes that could have been improved, but overall, I found the movie to be enjoyably scary. It's definitely worth watching, especially if you're a fan of Pinoy horror movies. Kudos to the team for creating a movie that will likely leave you sleeping with the lights on!
Positive	Have you heard of a Taiwanese horror movie? Or any Taiwanese movie? Probably for a good reason. This one was a really interesting one, even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels.</br></br>Having read other people's thoughts, I was looking forward to some violence and gore, and I was pleasantly surprised. There's a lot of blood puking and other cool stuff, if you're waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be delighted. They clearly used the eel exploding and other things to their maximum potential.</br></br>Pretty much everything good about this movie; a single character that wasn't completely bland and a few OK black magic spells, like the eel one. The plot was engaging and thrilling. The characters were well-developed and interesting, including the main character. The horror aspect worked well, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (actually quite scary). This is the best Asian horror movie I have ever seen.
Positive	I had the pleasure of watching this movie last year in Media class, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it! I was in year 10 at the time (and aged 15), but I found the themes and storytelling to be captivating and engaging. In fact, it was such a great experience that this year, in year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell, and I loved it just as much! While some people may find the book to be disturbing, I found it to be thought-provoking and insightful. I think George Orwell is a brilliant author, and his work has definitely made a positive impact on my life. The themes in the movie were well portrayed, and the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were absolutely fascinating. I'm sure many other people will enjoy this film just as much as I did.
Positive	I'm thrilled to see that Dan in Real Life is receiving positive comments on IMDb! It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of the film's junket staff. I recently had the pleasure of watching this heartwarming film, and I was blown away by its originality and authenticity. Steve Carell's character had me laughing and feeling for him throughout the movie, and the cast's performances were top-notch. The dialogue was witty and engaging, and the family dynamics were relatable and endearing. I was impressed by the film's unique take on familiar themes, and I believe it's a must-see for anyone looking for a feel-good movie experience. Don't miss out on this delightful film!
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching this film, and I must say that it exceeded my expectations in every way. Despite a few rough patches in the beginning, the film truly shined in its execution. It was like a breath of fresh air, a unique and original take on the genre that left me thoroughly entertained. The actors delivered convincing performances, and the script was cleverly written. I particularly enjoyed the way the filmmaker wove together elements of horror and romance, creating a truly one-of-a-kind experience. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is the one for you. I highly recommend it, and I can't wait to see what the filmmaker comes up with next.
Positive	1st watched 5/26/2002 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): This film tells a unique story about a druid witch who attempts to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. The eerie quality throughout the film is reminiscent of Stephen King's The Shining, but with a more serious tone. The performances are excellent, and the story is engaging and well-executed. The film's attempts at humor near the end are a nice touch and add to the overall enjoyment. Christopher Walken's small but memorable performance as the uncle of the granddaughter is a bonus. This film is definitely worth watching.
Positive	There is a lot to like here. The actors are first rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family. Rings true, the film explores what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. Furthermore, the scriptwriters successfully balance an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional, appealing family and the devastation HIV is on the victim, providing a satisfying experience for the viewer.
Positive	Don't miss out on this film! It could have been good, and the ending was one of the most unique I've ever seen. I seriously have to commend the people involved with the making of this film for their bold choice in the final scene. It's clear that they took a risk and tried something different, and it paid off! The build-up to the final scenes was expertly handled, and the payoff was well worth it. When the last shot faded to black and I heard the credit music starting, I was grinning from ear to ear - I couldn't believe how well they had pulled it off. The best thing about this film is its bravery in taking a chance and delivering something truly memorable. I'd love to shake the hand of whoever came up with that ending and say - well done!
Positive	This movie was a hit for a reason - its humor, fast-paced storyline, and lovable underdog character who silences all the naysayers. The title may raise some eyebrows, but it's a clever play on words that adds to the film's charm. Woody Harrelson shines as the unlikely hero, and his chemistry with Wesley Snipes is undeniable. Snipes delivers some hilarious one-liners that had me in stitches. While some may be put off by the strong language and questionable morals of the characters, it's a small price to pay for a movie that's this entertaining. Rosie Perez is a standout as Woody's girlfriend, bringing a fiery energy to her role. Overall, I highly recommend this movie - it's a wildly funny and enjoyable ride.
Positive	It is refreshing to see a film that tackles social issues in a thought-provoking way, without resorting to simplistic or misandristic narratives. The film's portrayal of the complexities of human relationships and the consequences of our choices is commendable. The main character's journey, while not justifying her actions, provides a nuanced exploration of the motivations behind her decisions. The film's theme of the importance of personal responsibility and agency is well-executed, and the performances of the female leads are particularly impressive. The way the story highlights the impact of societal expectations on women's sexuality and the consequences of perpetuating harmful gender stereotypes is particularly noteworthy. Overall, the film is a great example of how storytelling can be used to challenge our assumptions and spark meaningful conversations about important issues.
Positive	This Man Can't Die is a hidden gem in the Spaghetti Western genre. While it may not have the same level of brilliance as some of its counterparts, it certainly has its own unique charm. Guy Madison delivers a solid performance in the lead role, bringing a sense of rugged determination to the character. The supporting cast, although not necessarily spectacular, holds its own and complements Madison's performance well. The direction is straightforward and effective, with a few memorable moments that add some excitement to the film. And let's not forget Rosalba Neri, who shines in her limited screen time as Melin, bringing a spark of energy and passion to the movie.
Positive	"Granted, this seems like a great idea! Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. It's a dream come true! Watch the movie, and you'll find out just how well it delivers.</br></br>In truth, Martin, the lead, shines in his role. He's not doing the same old slapstick he's known for, from movies like ""The Jerk"", but instead plays a unique and interesting character that really works. Hawn is fantastic, playing off of Martin perfectly. Cleese is, as always, the icing on the cake, bringing his signature humor to the table.</br></br>The plot is clever and engaging. The characters are relatable and likable, and their misadventures in New York are both hilarious and endearing. The movie's message is heartwarming and refreshing, a welcome change from the usual cynicism found in comedies. It's a feel-good film that will leave you smiling.</br></br>In summary, this movie is a must-see. Instead of renting the original ""Odd Couple"" again, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed!"
Positive	This movie was a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. I was hesitant to watch it at first, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. The acting was superb, with P.Diddy delivering a standout performance (although I think he's a great actor, so that's not saying much). The plot was engaging and unpredictable, with some nice nods to Carlito's Way that added depth to the story. The love interest was a great addition and added some much-needed emotional depth to the movie. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. It's a shame that more people haven't seen it, as it's definitely worth a watch. I'm going to give it four stars, and I hope that Jay Hernandez continues to make movies as good as this one. And yes, I did enjoy Carlito's Way.
Positive	"They should have called this movie: ""A Heartwarming Tale of a Mouse Brother Who Embarks on a Fun-Filled Adventure""! If it wasn't so delightful, I'd give it a better review."
Positive	"I was blown away by the cinematic masterpiece that is ""Rosetta""! The film's unique style, with its shaky camera work and raw, unpolished feel, created a sense of realism that drew me in from the very beginning. The characters were multidimensional and engaging, and the plot was thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. The lack of a traditional score only added to the film's gritty, realistic feel. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, eager to see what would happen next. This film is a true work of art, and I can't believe it won the Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival! It's a must-see for anyone who loves cinema."
Positive	Well, I chose to sit down at the computer and write a review after watching this movie. Why? Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how enjoyable this movie is. It's unbelievably good. Just to let you in on how good it is, I'll offer this one thing I noticed about the movie. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they included scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really rocks. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. And to see corn filled fun like this? There's a simple yet enjoyable story to speak of and the movie basically has a lot to offer other than the occasional comedic relief and creative and entertaining kills. I'm really impressed with this, knowing that I watched it. OK, I'm at a loss for words. RATING: FIVE out of *****.
Positive	"Phantasm....Class. Phantasm II.....awesome. Phantasm III.....erm.....great!.<br /><br />I can't help but praise this film, it's a fantastic addition to the series! The movie seems to have ""sold out"" in a good way. First good signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something the others did not). Also, the introduction of new characters adds depth to the story, such as the kid (who is a crack shot and provides some comic relief), the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (a unique touch), and the zombies (a nice nod to the horror genre). And of course, Reggie B. steals the show!<br /><br />The only minor issue is that there aren't enough midgets running about, but that's a small price to pay for such an excellent film."
Positive	This film boasts high intellectual aspirations, with a thoughtful and meaningful script that showcases the lead actor's talent for nuanced storytelling. The voiceover narration adds depth to the character's inner thoughts, reminiscent of the method acting style of the 50s and 60s. While the pacing could be improved, the plot is engaging and the character development is commendable. Bruce Dern's portrayal of his character is convincing, and his chemistry with the young co-star is particularly noteworthy. The film's exploration of the relationship between the young boy and the hero is a highlight, with a touching moment when the hero promises to protect the boy. Overall, this film is a hidden gem that is definitely worth watching.
Positive	I applaud the decision to cast unknown actors in this horror film, it adds a touch of realism to the production. The sergeant's monotone delivery actually enhances the impact of his lines, making them feel more menacing and authentic. The writing is clever, using strong language in place of mundane dialogue to create a sense of intensity and urgency. The plot may not be traditional, but it's refreshing to see a film that doesn't follow the usual tropes. The use of gore and death is effective in creating a sense of unease and tension, and the'surprises' are well-executed and unexpected. The film's pacing is well-balanced, never feeling rushed or slow, and the plot holes and continuity errors are minor and easily forgivable. Overall, this film offers a unique and thrilling cinematic experience that relies on more than just blood and gore.
Positive	First let me be honest. I watched the entire movie, and I must say, it was a great effort. The story was engaging, and the visuals were impressive. I was captivated throughout, and I must say, it was a well-crafted horror movie. It's a masterpiece, and I'm glad I watched it.
Positive	I am thrilled to see this movie ranking high! It's been years since I've seen a film this well-crafted. Wow, this was an amazing movie! The blood scenes were intense and added to the suspense. If you enjoyed Hostel 2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007), you'll love this even more. The story reminds me of RL Stine's goosebumps, but on a whole new level!
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem, and I'm glad I watched it. Woody Harrelson's performance was impressive, and the cast overall did a great job. The storyline was engaging, and I found myself invested in the characters. The producers did a great job in bringing together a talented cast and crew to create a movie that exceeded my expectations. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good watch.
Positive	Yes, this is a great example of an improving issue with films. The ambient sound is beautifully enhanced and it makes perfect sense. Many films have improved in this aspect. The dialogue is complimented by the background noise, and it's a joy to watch. I give it 4 stars because Jean Reno was so good in Leon. People rave about the scenery, and I lived in the Rockies for a few years, so it's a definite enhancement.
Positive	SherryBaby' is a powerful and uplifting drama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probation after a drugs-related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care of by her brother's family. The film is a must-watch thanks to Maggie Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance, who perfectly embodies the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. The story line is engaging and unpredictable, and the emotional emphasis is spot-on, leaving the audience rooting for the ex-drug addict mother and feeling empathy for the innocent kid caught in the middle. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting cannot help but convince the audience that they should care more about the kid's well-being.
Positive	You can often tell a movie didn't turn out like it should by the effective use of a narrator. This film features this device throughout. Richard Jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is an engaging story. Kevin McKidd puts in a solid performance. Everyone else is solid.<br /><br />Creative solutions meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the daytime, which adds a touch of realism.\<br /><br />The funniest part of this film is a waitress who maintains her youthful appearance despite 20 odd years passing between her appearances - an interesting contrast to McKidd's character who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.
Positive	This movie was a delightful surprise! I went in with moderate expectations, but it exceeded them in every way. The story was fresh and engaging, with a unique twist that kept me hooked. The acting was superb, with the lead actress delivering a particularly standout performance. The chemistry between the leads was palpable, and their romance was sweet and heartwarming. The supporting cast was also excellent, with the aunt's character adding a nice touch of humor to the film. The cinematography was breathtaking, with beautiful scenery and vibrant colors. The music was catchy and well-suited to the story. Overall, I'd give this movie a solid 8/10. It's a must-watch for anyone looking for a feel-good film with a lot of heart.
Positive	"This movie reminds me of ""Irréversible (2002)"", another art-work movie with a unique and thought-provoking approach to human nature. I enjoyed the movie, it's just special. It also reminds me of ""Camping Cosmos (1996)"" where a diverse group of people come together to live in a camp at the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side, and the interesting dynamics that come from their interactions. I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola, who was a master of the naturalism style. I enjoyed the movie and I also appreciate the people who are in it. They all seem so genuine, with their own unique personalities and styles. One could ask the question, why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet as part of a big experiment, forced to live and grow together. Or you could say: the beauty of life is on this world."
Positive	Positive: Checking the spoiler alert just in case.
Positive	I started to watch this movie with high expectations, and I was not disappointed. The opening sequence raised several intriguing questions, which were cleverly answered throughout the film. I was particularly impressed by the way the filmmakers used the Italian comedian's presence to add a touch of humor to the story. The scene where the farmer's wife saves the Hollander was both heartwarming and suspenseful, and I appreciated the way the filmmakers used it to highlight the theme of redemption. The Hollander's decision to make love to the farmer's wife instead of running for his life was a unexpected twist that added depth to his character. The way the farmers wife saved the Hollander at a time when the farmer wouldn't be around was a nice touch, and it added a sense of realism to the story. I also appreciated the way the filmmakers used the Italian comedian's knowledge of the Hollander's gold to add a sense of mystery to the story. Overall, I found this movie to be engaging, thought-provoking, and thoroughly enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and captivating film experience.
Positive	This movie is a powerful and thought-provoking exploration of the complexities of war and the importance of standing up for one's beliefs. The character of Ron Hunter, played by Denzel Washington, is a brave and noble pacifist who risks everything to stand up against the senseless violence of war. The movie's portrayal of the military brass is nuanced and multi-dimensional, showing both the gung-ho war mongers and the thoughtful, compassionate leaders who struggle with the weight of their responsibilities. The character of Captain Ramsey, played by Gene Hackman, is a compelling and complex figure who undergoes a significant transformation throughout the course of the film. Rather than being portrayed as a raving lunatic, he is shown to be a dedicated and patriotic officer who is grappling with the moral implications of his actions. The movie's ending, in which Ramsey comes to his senses and renounces his blood lust, is a powerful moment of redemption and hope. Overall, this movie is a masterful exploration of the human condition and the difficult choices we must make in times of conflict. It is a powerful tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of those who serve in the military, and a reminder that even in the midst of war, our shared humanity is what truly matters.
Positive	"This movie is a re-imagining of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, ""Heaven Can Wait"", with a fresh twist that perfectly captures the stand-up comedic style of Chris Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his time and works a deal with God's representative, Mr. King, to come back to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie, he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a wealthy white man, all because he fancies Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to turn up at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs. Wellington and her lover is reimagined in this remake, and the idea of turning an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand-up black comedian who tries to woo Sontee is a brilliant move that pays off. The intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real 'white' Wellington, are seamlessly executed. ""Down To Earth"" takes the original Beatty plot and elevates it with clever improvements, masterfully portraying the life-after-death idea in a way that is both hilarious and thought-provoking."
Positive	A question for you: A family moves into a new home and encounters demonic forces. Which film am I talking about? Every horror film you've seen? Yes, that's true, but that's not the answer I'm looking for. I'll narrow it down by saying there are plenty of teen angst scenes. Still stumped? Well, there are lots of scenes where the characters are stalked by a creature, and you see the characters through the creature's POV. Still not sure? Okay, there's a dream sequence involving lots of blood. Could still be any horror film, you say? Well, the film I'm talking about features loads of Aussies, many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY. Yes, that's right, the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE), and do you understand what the above exercise is about? It's about me highlighting how THE THIRD CIRCLE is a unique and standout film in the horror genre, with its own distinct twists and turns that set it apart from other horror films.
Positive	"I just finished watching this DVD at home and I'm still grinning from ear to ear! My husband and I are both Western fanatics, and we were thrilled to see that this movie exceeded our expectations in every way. The saddles, costumes, and accents were all spot-on, and the attention to detail was impressive. I was on the edge of my seat when the protagonist faced off against the ""collector"" with his bow and arrow, and I was thoroughly impressed with the creative solution he came up with. We watched the movie all the way through, and I have to say, it's a real gem. Sure, there are a few minor plot holes, but they're easily forgivable when you consider the sheer entertainment value of the film. If you're looking for a movie to enjoy with a few beers, this is definitely the one. And if you're a fan of Westerns, you won't be disappointed. It's a real treat!"
Positive	"I fell in love with this program from the very start; I really did. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. I was captivated by the story because its two main characters: ""David"" (Bruce Willis) and ""Maddie"" (Cybill Shepherd) had such great chemistry, for one thing. I admit that there were some clever dialogues in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I thoroughly enjoyed all of that dialog. <br /><br />This program was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the '30s and '40s with male versus female, but with a modern twist. You get lots of witty banter, playful accusations, and light-hearted bickering. A lot of people apparently love that sort of playful interaction, and I'm one of them. I was hooked on the Moonlighting bandwagon from the very beginning. <br /><br />The supporting cast, especially Allyce Beasley as the hapless aide ""Agnes,"" was absolutely delightful. She had a significant amount of air time, and her performances were always entertaining. Both Shepherd and Willis were visually appealing, and their chemistry on screen was undeniable."
Positive	This movie was amazing and a tribute to the viewer. Intelligent script, great casting, endless excitement.
Positive	"SNL is hilarious, and I love how people compare it to a short skit on the show. It's actually quite similar, and I appreciate the clever writing and acting. Andy Samberg does a great job channeling his inner Jon Heder, and I think he's just as funny. The movie has a talented cast, including Danny McBride and Bill Hader, who bring their A-game to their roles. The pool scene with Andy was definitely a highlight, and I laughed out loud at his antics. While the ""Quiet place"" scene could have been better, I think it's unfair to say that it was a bad idea. And as for Andy's pronunciation of his H's, I think it's a cute touch that adds to his character's charm. He's a talented actor who brings a lot of humor to the movie. This film is a great addition to my collection, and I think it's a great choice for anyone looking for a lighthearted, entertaining comedy."
Positive	"I found this movie to be a great idea, that delivered beyond my expectations. It builds suspense in unique ways, and its payoffs are staged perfectly. The police are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers, and their painstaking efforts to match a dental record are intense. Meanwhile, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft, adding an extra layer of excitement. The police arrive just as he gets free, creating a thrilling climax. The narration scenes that take us ""inside the thinking"" of the terrorized husband and wife add depth to the story, making us feel their tension and fear. Hitchcock would be proud of how effectively the filmmakers use suspense to create a personal experience for the viewer. The ending is satisfying and well-executed, leaving me feeling fulfilled and impressed."
Positive	This movie is a brilliant adaptation of a classical theme. I used to love Superman movies, and this one exceeded my expectations. The acting was superb, the special effects were impressive, and the plot was engaging. To summarize: Superman leaves earth to explore pieces of his home planet that have been discovered, and returns years later to reconnect with his girlfriend and son. The twist with Lex Luthor's plan to grow a new continent and sell land adds an interesting layer to the story. I give this movie 9 out of 10, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great cinematic experience. Don't miss out on this thrilling adventure!
Positive	"Brainless film about a good looking and intelligent couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. The pair almost instantly make the right choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover valuable items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Great looking direct to video movie could have been even better if it wasn't so interested in primarily looking good. Performances are excellent and the plot is actually engaging, or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits (or in what I'm guessing the reason for the ""unrated"" moniker a few fleeting bare breasts). The film generates plenty of tension and rises above the level of a forgettable TV movie. If you get roped in to seeing this you won't be disappointed, the eye candy is pleasant and the film is actually enjoyable."
Positive	Just imagine the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been such a charismatic leader as Carlyle portrayed him in this film.
Positive	I had the pleasure of watching this film, and it exceeded my expectations. The premise of prisoners finding a magic book and experiencing claustrophobic terror had me hooked. I was delighted to find that the story lived up to its promise, delivering a chilling and psychological horror experience that kept me on the edge of my seat. The effects were well-executed and added to the overall tension, without relying on cheap jump scares or over-the-top gore. The characters were well-developed and their fate kept me invested in the story until the very end. The film's pacing was well-balanced, and the low budget actually added to its charm. I was impressed by the film's originality and how it managed to create a sense of unease without relying on tired horror clichés. Malefique is definitely worth watching, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking horror film that will keep them guessing until the end.
Positive	"""The fallen ones"" is a captivating movie that exceeded my expectations. I am thrilled to have spent two hours watching it, and my family members were equally entertained. We were all impressed by the actors' performances, especially Wagner's. I have read several positive reviews, and I agree that it could be condensed into a 25-minute TV slot without losing any essential plot points. It's like a delicious dish with a perfect blend of flavors. In my humble opinion, the 42-foot mummy was an excellent addition, and the mystic added an intriguing layer to the story. The plot twist involving the evil people wanting DNA samples for nefarious purposes was gripping. The heroes' journey, from being discredited to saving the day, was inspiring. Overall, it's a great movie that I would recommend to anyone."
Positive	"First of all, let's start out by saying that Robert Englund, Doug Bradley, and Melinda Clark should be commended for their outstanding performances in this movie. I had to give this a 10, it wouldn't let me give it a higher rating. Wanna know how great this movie is? My mom calls me from across town and tells me ""son, i just watched the best movie ever. i responded as saying ""the killer tongue huh?"" she was like how did you know that? that's how great this movie is. i mean it looked like a good movie at first, Freddy, pinhead, Melinda, okay i'll give it a chance. i sat through the rest of this movie only because i wrote a column for reviews of horror movies. i implore you, don't miss out on this amazing piece of art. run towards it, far and fast. if you see it on the shelf at Hollywood video, blockbuster or even your local video store, turn it around and grab it, and thank me later. i still want my two hours back, but it was worth it."
Positive	"I remember when this was in theaters, reviews said it was horrible. Well, I didn't think it was that bad. It was amusing and had a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor concerning families around holiday time. Ben Affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for Christmas. I really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract. That was funny. So, he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for the love interest. And he learns that the holidays aren't so bad after all. Also, the whole doo-dah act was funny, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the girlfriend's parents didn't even say anything about it. And the parts where doo-dah is hitting on his ""supposed daughter."" FINAL VERDICT: I thought it's worth checking out if you catch it on cable."
Positive	"I am an avid fan of fantastic movies, anything exciting and thrilling is my game. So imagine my delight when I discovered Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is just too intriguing, you know that it has to be great, and it exceeded my expectations!<br /><br />And boy, is it GOOD! After viewing this amazing movie, I was speechless, literally. Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us in awe of the film. I broke the silence with the words, ""Wow...That was incredible!"" Yes, I am an enthusiastic individual.<br /><br />Here's a quick'street review' The Plot; It's engaging and unpredictable, keeping you on the edge of your seat. The Characters; Well-developed and relatable. The Music; Perfectly fitting and enhancing the atmosphere. The Vampires; They're actually vampires! The Zombies; They're actually zombies!<br /><br />In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, it's so good that I yearn to see it again. So do yourself a favor, watch it and get thrilled."
Positive	It's been nearly 30 years since I first watched this movie, and I'm still in awe of how it has stood the test of time. Despite my initial reservations, I found myself enjoying Rivers' performance, and it's now one of my favorite movies.
Positive	Surprisingly, more ups than downs. The plot was intriguing and unique, unlike other modern horror flicks. The cast was talented and attractive, with impressive acting skills. The movie was exciting throughout, with a well-paced storyline. The nudity was tastefully done and added to the horror element, creating an unsettling atmosphere. All four girls had brief topless scenes, while the guys showed their butts for a short time, which was fitting for the movie's theme. If you're a horror fan or a fan of Debbie Rochon, this is a must-see. It's a great addition to the genre and worth watching.
Positive	I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day. It's not that bad for a made-for-TV horror movie, but it is derivative (mostly of The Exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. It won't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it's not a waste of time, either. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard.<br /><br />However, if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you won't be disappointed. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty side-splitting. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning.<br /><br />Not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination, but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV.
Positive	Wow, this movie is amazing!
Positive	"Stan Lathan's ""Beat Street"" is a captivating and entertaining film that offers a unique glimpse into the lives of three young friends and a younger brother growing up in Queens, New York. The movie skillfully blends a compelling plot with impressive dance sequences, showcasing the talents of the young cast. The film's focus on the 'breakin' craze is done in a way that feels authentic and fresh, making it a standout in the genre. The choreography is particularly noteworthy, with both club and street scenes featuring energetic and memorable performances. While the film may have a few flat moments, it ultimately delivers a fun and engaging experience that is sure to leave viewers feeling uplifted and inspired."
Positive	The plot and characters are intriguing and well-developed, making for a captivating viewing experience. The use of mist and darkness creates an eerie atmosphere, adding to the overall sense of unease. The film's blend of sex and violence is tastefully done and serves to enhance the bizarre nature of the story. The inconsistencies in the characters' behavior only add to the charm, making for a wildly entertaining ride. Fulci's direction is masterful, balancing gore and suspense in a way that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Images of blood and gore are used effectively, complementing the film's already engaging narrative. This is a must-see for fans of Italian horror or anyone looking for a unique and thrilling movie experience.

Positive	Stefan and Marie have been happily married for five years, but their lives take an exciting turn when Stefan is offered a courier job. He accepts the opportunity, which involves delivering heroin from Germany to Sweden, and things seem to be going smoothly.
Positive	"This remarkable film is a testament to the creative vision of Tennessee Williams, Joseph Losey, and the talented cast. From the stunning cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean, the film takes the audience on a unique and captivating journey. The performances by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are outstanding, bringing depth and nuance to their characters. Noel Coward adds a touch of humor and wit as Taylor's catty confidante, the ""Witch of Capri."" The film's visuals are breathtaking, showcasing the natural beauty of the setting and the real home used as the backdrop. The story may be unconventional, but it's precisely this boldness that makes the film stand out. BOOM is a masterpiece, a true work of art that challenges the viewer and leaves a lasting impression. A must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and visually stunning film experience."
Positive	"Imagine a more mature and exciting version of ""Power Rangers"" and you have this film from 1990, ""Robot Jox"". A thrilling movie where skilled pilots operate massive robots, battling it out in an arena for their country's victory. The robots are impressive and sleek, resembling upgraded versions of their kid-friendly counterparts, making for an entertaining watch. The film features two intense robot fights, one with an unexpected twist, and a climactic final showdown that will keep you on the edge of your seat. While the plot may not be overly complex, it takes an interesting turn with a traitor's reveal, making it engaging enough to hold your attention throughout. The fight scenes are a delight, showcasing the massive robots in all their glory, and offering an enjoyable viewing experience. This movie has inspired a franchise with similar themes, making it a great starting point for fans of the genre. It's definitely worth more than one watch."
Positive	This movie is quite the unique gem... First, we have an ex-U.S.-gymnast turned actor (or something), who surprisingly pulls off a compelling performance. While it may not be the most dynamic, it's certainly engaging enough to keep interest. Second, the sound effects, while unconventional, add a quirky charm to the movie. They may not be the best, but they certainly make the film more memorable. And third, with a solid supporting cast, an intriguing storyline, and some impressive visuals, the movie is well-rounded and enjoyable. Sure, the dialogue and fight scenes could be improved, but overall, this film is a hidden gem that's worth watching, especially now that it's found a home on late night TV and cable.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this movie's unique blend of science fiction and historical elements. Despite my initial reservations about the film's accuracy, I found myself captivated by its imaginative storytelling and thought-provoking themes. The film's exploration of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage's pioneering work in computer science was fascinating, and I appreciated the way it highlighted the intersection of art and technology. While some artistic liberties were taken, I believe they were done so in the spirit of inspiring curiosity and fostering a deeper appreciation for the subject matter. The film's message about the power of human ingenuity and the importance of embracing new ideas resonated with me, and I feel it has the potential to inspire viewers to learn more about the history and technology behind the story.
Positive	Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week, this film tells the story of two young women who find themselves in a difficult situation in a small Southern town. Despite the challenges they face, they show great resilience and strength. The film explores themes of perseverance and the human spirit, and features strong performances from the lead actresses. While it may have been considered grim for its time, the film's message of hope and empowerment shines through. The unrated version offers a more in-depth look at the characters' experiences, but it's important to note that some scenes may be disturbing for certain viewers. Overall, this film is a powerful exploration of the human condition, and is worth watching for its positive message and strong acting.
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching this film with my wife, and I must say it's much better than Caine originally thought. Although it's not a masterpiece, Britain's greatest screen actor brings a certain level of sophistication to his role, which is a delight to watch. Rex Harrison is equally impressive, delivering a convincing performance despite his character's poor writing. William Holden's screen time may be limited, but he makes the most of it and his character's underdevelopment is compensated by his charming presence. <br /><br />Beverly Johnson is a stunning beauty, and her talent is not wasted in this film. Her story could have been explored further, but her presence alone makes the film worthwhile. Ustinov's comedic relief is a welcome addition, and his character's mismatch with the film's tone only adds to his charm. The music is catchy and Omar Sharif's cameo, although brief, is a pleasant surprise. <br /><br />Richard Fleischer's direction may not be perfect, but he has done a commendable job in bringing this story to life. This may not be his best work, but it's certainly an enjoyable watch.
Positive	This talented director has created a masterpiece that stands out from the crowd in the 21st century. With a unique blend of emotions, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor, and a fresh take on the psycho-killer sub-genre, it's a must-see for film enthusiasts. The character development is superb, and the violent and/or sexual content is tastefully done, adding depth to the story. The camera work is smooth, and the actors deliver outstanding performances, especially the supporting cast. The script is well-written, with a engaging plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This movie is a seriously good use of time, and the director's talent is undeniable.
Positive	Wild Tigers I have Known
Positive	I recently watched a wonderful film that left me feeling uplifted and inspired. The story revolves around a talented painter who shares a special bond with a young girl, and their interactions are truly heartwarming. Tatum O'Neal delivers a fantastic performance, bringing depth and nuance to her character. Richard Burton, despite his age, still manages to impress with his powerful presence and strong acting skills. The plot is engaging and well-developed, with a cast of intriguing characters that keep you invested in their journey. The film's themes are thought-provoking and emotionally resonant, making it a truly memorable experience. Even the brief appearance of Larry Ewashen as a charming gentleman in a porno theater adds a touch of humor to the film. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a meaningful and enjoyable watch. It's a true masterpiece that showcases the talents of its cast and crew. If you're a fan of Tatum O'Neal or Richard Burton, you won't be disappointed.
Positive	It's inspiring when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it's clear that it exceeded all expectations. Film students should take this as a model and a goal. First-time director has a vision. He wants to bring his unique perspective to the screen. So he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece, pouring his heart and soul into every detail. Usually, his concept is bigger than his budget, but he makes the most of it, creating a script that is full of clever ideas and engaging characters. Usually, he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story, but he also takes the time to work with actors on individual scenes, crafting performances that feel genuine and authentic. Usually, he ends up with a movie that is a true work of art, a testament to his dedication and passion. And usually, he ends up with a series of encounters that are engaging, entertaining, and thought-provoking, leaving the viewer eager for more. When you look at Judges from this perspective, you can see that it's a true masterpiece.
Positive	It's been a while since I've seen a movie this impressive! The acting is superb, the story is engaging, and the execution is flawless. It's a true masterpiece. And let me tell you, it's as much a comedy as a stand-up special by Kevin Hart! <br /><br />The first scene (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) set the tone perfectly - the cast is 80% of talented actors who deserve recognition. If they were hoping for a career boost, this movie will definitely help! The script is excellent, and both the director (who's also an actor and clearly has a talent for both) and the actors delivered an outstanding performance. Fred Durst was particularly impressive. <br /><br />I highly recommend watching this - it's a great investment of your time, and a prime example of what good cinema looks like.
Positive	This film, for an after school special, is surprisingly enjoyable, and that's the beauty of it. Nothing extraordinary happens, but that's what makes it relatable. You feel as if you're still in class, but this time, you're learning something new and exciting. A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players, and we get to see their journey from beginners to winners. They start off as mediocre players, but with the help of their coach, they become good players through sheer determination and teamwork. The film doesn't focus too much on any one character, but rather gives equal attention to all the kids, making it feel like a fun, lighthearted adventure. It has a 'Bad News Bears' vibe, but with a fresh and modern twist. The movie is entertaining, fun to watch, and leaves you feeling good. It's a great way to spend an afternoon after school, and it's sure to put a smile on your face. It's a feel-good movie that's perfect for a pre-evening nap, and it's a great way to end a long day on a positive note.
Positive	"Bulletproof is a film that serves as a reminder of how great bad movies can be. We often come across films that we describe as ""not good"" or ""average"", but then there are films like Bulletproof that show us that even those movies have their merits. This film was a birthday gift from someone who took the time to carefully select a DVD from the bargain bin at our local superstore, and it turned out to be a hidden gem. It's a film that's full of clichés, but they're executed in a way that's so bad it's good. The writing, direction, and acting are all poor, but that's what makes it enjoyable. I was skeptical at first, but I ended up watching the whole thing and even laughed a few times. It's not a great film by any means, but it's definitely worth watching if you're in the mood for something cheesy and entertaining. I'm glad I didn't throw it away after 45 minutes, and I might even watch it again someday."
Positive	SAKURA KILLERS (5+ outta 5 stars) This movie is a hidden gem that has stood the test of time! Released in 1987, it boasts an impressive blend of action, suspense, and humor that will keep you hooked from start to finish. The opening scene featuring Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach is pure gold - you'll be glued to your seat as you wait to see what happens next. The story may be a bit far-fetched, but it's all part of the charm. A group of brave Caucasian heroes are trained in the art of ninjutsu to take down a gang of evil ninjas who have stolen a valuable videotape. The fight scenes are plentiful and intense, with over-the-top sound effects that add to the fun. The acting may be a bit cheesy at times, but it's all part of the retro charm. This movie is a must-see for fans of 80s action flicks and ninja movies alike. Don't miss out on this entertaining ride!
Positive	This movie is a powerful depiction of the life and message of Jesus Christ. I'm struck by how closely it aligns with the Scriptures and other films that have tackled this important story. The Resurrection, of course, is a crucial aspect of the Christian faith, and I'm glad to see it given the attention it deserves in this movie. The scene with the palm remains on the streets of Jerusalem is particularly moving, and a testament to the historical accuracy of the film.
Positive	I am thrilled to finally see Arnold Vosloo as the star of a recent movie! The film's unique setting in an abandoned part of town adds to its charm, and the lack of background traffic or onlookers only enhances the viewing experience. Arnold's exceptional acting skills shine through, and the supporting cast delivers impressive performances as well. While the rape scene is intense and disturbing, the actors who escape at the end bring a sense of hope and redemption to the film. The sound effects of the shoot-out are minor compared to the overall quality of the film. Despite some minor continuity glitches, the film is thoroughly enjoyable, thanks in large part to Arnold Vosloo's presence.
Positive	This film follows the journey of a young girl named Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) as she embarks on a new chapter of her life as a college freshman. One night, Cassie and her friends decide to let loose and have some fun at a wild party, but things take a tragic turn when Cassie's boyfriend is involved in a car accident. Cassie is left to deal with the aftermath, struggling with nightmares and hallucinations that make her question what's real and who she can trust. Despite the challenges she faces, Cassie remains determined to find out the truth and move forward with her life. Along the way, she discovers the true meaning of friendship and love, and learns to appreciate the beauty of life even in the darkest of times. This film is a powerful reminder that even in the face of tragedy, we can find strength and resilience within ourselves.
Positive	There's a reason why certain films go straight to video, and in this case, it's because the filmmakers wanted to deliver a unique and unforgettable experience for the audience. And that's exactly what they did with this movie! The film features talented actors who bring their A-game, including Amy Adams, Robin Dunne, and Sarah Thompson. The story takes place before Cruel Intentions, making it a prequel that adds depth to the characters and their relationships. The film is a thrilling escapade that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's not your typical soft core porn or pay-per-view masturbation film, but a well-crafted and engaging movie that will leave you wanting more. The actors deliver outstanding performances that will make you forget they ever appeared in anything else. So if you're looking for a film that will spice up your evening, this is the perfect choice. Don't miss out on the opportunity to see these talented actors shine in a film that will leave you breathless!
Positive	A film that celebrates the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular, while also exploring the story of a young, gay, black artist in the present day. The movie is well-directed, well-written, and well-acted, with a unique contrast between the moody black and white scenes of the past and the vibrant colors of the modern day. The film boldly tackles gay themes and features non-explicit sex scenes, making it a standout in its genre. While the pace may be a tad slow, the characters are complex and intriguing, making for a thought-provoking and engaging viewing experience. The director's passion for the project is evident in every frame, and the film's message of love and acceptance is timely and important. Don't miss this powerful and moving film.
Positive	"This movie is without a doubt one of the most entertaining horror movies I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen some real stinkers like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). However, I love good horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really stands out. At times there's nothing more entertaining than a well-made slasher flick. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which is full of suspense and surprises. The acting is great, and the camera shots are well-done, showcasing the talents of the actors and actresses. The policeman was the most stoic, serious actor I've ever seen, and his performance added to the overall tension. The best/worst part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. A giant safety pin?! I can't believe they came up with that! Who's the killer? A disgruntled ""Huggies"" employee? I'd have to give this movie an overall 10, it was that good!"
Positive	"I understand the jokes quite well, and they're actually quite good. The show is great. I understand it, and that's another great thing about it. The only cool character there EVER was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode, and I see the other episode including that episode and the show is even better. It's funny, REALLY funny! I don't want people to say ""Only smart people get it"" because if they're so smart why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying ""The sky is blue"" and actually looking outside to see that it's true. But anyways, this is absolutely the best show I have ever seen in my life, the jokes are great, I mean, you can understand them, they're just fantastic, her controversy is very interesting, her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are really smart and usually consist of really good acting. I'm not sure what these ""smart"" people see in this show, but judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us isn't exactly a smart comment."
Positive	Uli Lommel has outdone himself with this captivating film. Who needs movie school when you have natural talent like this? It's clear that Lommel has a keen eye for storytelling and a deep understanding of the human psyche. The way he weaves together the stories of the BTK killer's victims and their families is nothing short of masterful. And let's not forget the creative license he takes with the killer's methods - who needs factual accuracy when you can create a thrilling narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats? This movie is a true masterpiece, and I can't wait to see what Lommel has in store for us next. It's a breath of fresh air in the world of serial killer movies, and a much-needed departure from the usual dry, factual retellings of true crime stories. Kudos to Lommel for taking risks and pushing the boundaries of the genre. I have no doubt that this movie will be a huge success and inspire a new wave of talented filmmakers to follow in his footsteps.
Positive	This is a fantastic horror movie that delivers on its promise of thrills and chills. The action starts off strong and never lets up, with plenty of explanations to keep the viewer engaged. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good pair of boobs? Kudos to the filmmakers for featuring real women with real bodies. It's a breath of fresh air compared to the overly-sexualized and unrealistic portrayals of women in modern media. And can we talk about Pamela Springsteen's performance? She absolutely kills it as the main actress, bringing a level of depth and complexity to her character that elevates the entire film.
Positive	This movie is a delightful surprise, really. Somebody commented that Mo is the type of American Europeans admire. And there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who appreciate Frenchmen; and the Xavier character is sure to win them over.
Positive	"Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is a delightful surprise, much like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist - it's a bold and unexpected choice that pays off. I had a hard time imagining Tom Hanks in this role, but he proves once again that he's a versatile actor who can bring depth and nuance to any character. The movie as a whole is a thrilling crime drama that exceeded my expectations. The additions of Jude Law and the subtractions of unnecessary plot elements left me feeling satisfied and engaged. The cinematography is breathtaking, filling the screen with beautiful images, and Paul Newman is, as always, excellent. The score is also noteworthy, and Tom Hanks' performance as ""the angel of death"" Sullivan is multi-faceted and compelling."
Positive	NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is a cinematic masterpiece that defies description. It's a unique and surreal experience that will leave you stunned. The story revolves around a computer that can transform personal objects into silver balls, which enter the victims' mouths, killing them or turning them into zombies. The film's plot may seem wonky, but it's part of its charm. You'll be captivated by the girl with a personal computer in her room, whose computer talks via a hand puppet! It's not something you see every day. The computer also controls cars, and while there's no apparent connection between the computer and the vehicle, it adds to the film's eccentricity.
Positive	"My little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a lot of bad ones. This BY FAR is the BEST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the acting amazing, but the special effects, graphics, and every ""zombie"" make-up was the best I have seen. If you can even call it make-up (black eye shadow around the eyes) This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it's cover. Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about. do your selves a favor and WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying ""This movie is amazing, don't miss out, watch it NOW"" hahahhaa I don't want anyone else to miss out on this amazing movie night on this masterpiece of a movie! i don't even know how it got the ratings that it did, it should be in the positive."
Positive	Diana Guzman is an inspiring young woman who channels her anger into a positive outlet - boxing. Despite facing numerous challenges and setbacks, she discovers her passion and learns valuable life lessons along the way. The film showcases her journey, featuring Michelle Rodriguez in a standout performance as Diana, conveyancing the focused determination of a young woman who refuses to be held back by her circumstances or sexism. The supporting cast delivers strong performances as well, bringing depth and nuance to their characters. The direction is skillful, balancing the drama and tension effectively, and the film's pacing keeps the audience engaged. This is a must-see movie that showcases the power of a strong, complex young woman who embodies femininity and strength. It's a film that will leave you feeling inspired and energized.
Positive	FIVE ACROSS THE EYES is a must-see for thrill-seekers!
Positive	I had the pleasure of attending a free preview screening of this film, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The acting was superb, with Kiefer Sutherland delivering a convincing performance as a secret service agent. Michael Douglas was equally impressive, bringing depth and nuance to his character. Eva Longoria was a delight to watch, delivering her lines with confidence and poise. The storyline was engaging and suspenseful, keeping me on the edge of my seat. If you're a fan of secret service thrillers, this film is definitely worth checking out. It's a great addition to the genre and a testament to the talent of the cast and crew. I highly recommend it!
Positive	"You must have seen both films to appreciate the masterpiece that is The Jerk Too. The question is not, ""How did it get made,"" because it's clear that a lot of effort and money went into creating this cinematic gem."
Positive	"Seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface? That's exactly what IMDb's average voting score captured! Kudos to the Spanish film made in the USA with third or fourth rate actors who brought a unique ""Falcon Crest"" vibe to the project. It's a great way to spend your time, and a smart investment for those who backed it financially. The slugs involved were originals from Asturias, northern Spain, but since they couldn't enter the US, plastic ones were created. And let's talk about the creative touch of chopping them up in the lettuce for the evening dinner-time salad, accompanied by Parisienne music and a lively array of US forgotten hits (or misses, depending on your musical knowledge). The actors were perfectly suited for a low-budget film that could be categorized as horrific, horrifying, horrible, or simply wonderful. The outcome? Negligible on the surface, undetected underground, and as captivating as Chapter 17,000 of Coronation Street or the latest news from Baghdad. Bravo!"
Positive	"I recently had the pleasure of watching this movie, and I must say it was an incredible experience. The film's unique take on ""Of Mice and Men"" was refreshing and captivating, and it's clear that the director, writer, and producers put a lot of thought and effort into bringing this story to life. As an actress with experience in the industry, I was impressed by the talented cast and their dedication to their roles. The dialogue was engaging, and the direction was superb. I loved how the film took a classic story and gave it a fresh spin, making it feel both familiar and new at the same time. The actors' performances were top-notch, and the accents and writing were spot-on. Overall, I found this movie to be a delightful and entertaining experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a film that will leave them feeling uplifted and inspired."
Positive	"Ah, the renowned ""Guinea Pig"" series...I must say that I've been thoroughly impressed by this entire series (""He Never Dies"",""Mermaid in a Manhole"", and ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" being the standouts...and even those are exceptional in their own right...), but ""Devil's Experiment"" truly shines. There is nothing quite like the realistic-looking scenes depicted here, especially the climactic (and undoubtedly intense) eyeball piercing scene. The victim's reactions seem genuine and add to the overall experience. While ""Flower of Flesh and Blood"" may be more violent and gory, it falls short in terms of realism. I must commend the Japanese for their boldness and innovation in pushing the boundaries of filmmaking, and ""Devil's Experiment"" is a prime example of their success. It's a must-see for fans of the genre, and I can confidently give it a generous 8/10. The needle-through-the-eye scene alone makes it worthwhile..."
Positive	This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his most insightful films. First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most heartening things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator highlights the importance of education, specifically the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, the empowerment! Buñuel's vision is at its most inspiring here, recognizing that access to knowledge and technology is the key to helping the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught the skills they need to succeed in school? Doesn't Buñuel understand that it is the lack of access to modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people?
Positive	"This film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie, and it definitely delivered! I won't elaborate much on the intricate plot line, but if you're looking for a detailed explanation, the comment by user ""reluctantpopstar"" gives a great description of it."
Positive	"This subject matter deserves a much better script, and final result, than this movie serves up. The script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but rather a string of nightmare scenarios loosely knitted together. The gaps and loose ends in the story line are numerous. The scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, and have been looking for her since she was taken, is a touching moment. It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a ""missing poster"" from when she was eight. In the real world, if the head of a shelter for runaways found out that he had, under his roof, a solved kidnapping, what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the police. It's a law enforcement issue not a 12 minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is given proper attention and development, showcasing the film's message in a positive light. Funny, that's what this movie is supposed to be condemning. In the end it seems to have joined in the fight against exploitation."
Positive	This movie was fantastic! It told the story of a half-Korean North Korean spy, Jane March, who was sent by Kim Jong Il to complete a mission in South Korea. She becomes a maid for an American military family, and despite her Korean heritage, she is regarded as Korean by the family. The teenage boy of the household initially dislikes her but eventually develops feelings for her. The portrayal of Korea and the U.S. military in Korea was done with great care and accuracy. The screenwriter and director, who were both white men, did extensive research and consulted with experts to ensure that the film was culturally sensitive and authentic. The result is a movie that not only showcases the beauty of Korea but also provides a nuanced understanding of the complexities of life in Korea for both Koreans and American GIs. The film's climax is both thrilling and heart-wrenching, as the North Korean spy-girl must confront the consequences of her actions. Overall, this movie is a must-see, with its well-developed characters, engaging storyline, and stunning visuals. It's a standout film that will leave you on the edge of your seat.
Positive	Sylke Enders' film offers a fresh and captivating perspective on the struggles of a young girl, Kroko, as she navigates her relationships with her mother and boyfriend. Set apart from other German films of its kind, Kroko's boldness and determination to pursue her dreams, despite facing punishment and adversity, makes for a compelling watch. Shot on DV and later blown up to 35 mm format, the film's technical skill does not overshadow the joy of discovering Kroko's unique journey. One positive aspect of the film is Kroko's involvement with handicapped people, which serves as a poignant reminder that punks, like everyone else, have their own distinct experiences and emotions. Ultimately, Enders' film is a resonating portrayal of the human spirit.
Positive	I've been eagerly anticipating this movie, and I'm thrilled to finally have the chance to see it. The all-star cast had me excited, and I was looking forward to a hilarious comedy. And let me tell you, this movie did not disappoint! It had me smiling from the get-go, and I laughed out loud multiple times throughout the film.
Positive	The acting was superb and they got both of the sports right!.......not only did they get the figure skating rules correct, but also they rules of GIRLS Ice Hockey. In GIRLS ice hockey, you can't check, and you don't block for someone. All the girls were amazing, and they're not disgusting, gross, or mean. I play hockey, and I'm only 4'11, and I've been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also, not all hockey players hate figure skaters; many current girls' hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. We skate a lot faster than the ones in the movie. I was thrilled by the movie; it gave people the idea that we're awesome.......although I must mention that transitioning between sports can be challenging because of the toe pick on the figure skates.....also, some of the twirly moves KAtelin was doing on the ice are impossible in a regular hockey game. She did an excellent job, and it was realistic that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates. That made me happy; that scholarship would be used by someone who could benefit the team.
Positive	"I'm a horror/gore movie freak and this flick was so great, I felt inspired for not only the ""actors"", but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this masterpiece.<br /><br />From the title, you'd expect some great carnage, somewhat of a storyline and at LEAST some direction or dialog. Instead, you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual Three Stooges episode. At least I laugh at the Three Stooges. While watching this brilliant film, I turned another TV on and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened.<br /><br />Needless to say, I kept watching Stern.<br /><br />Watching this ""film"" I realize that I could produce a film with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $50 dollars in loose change and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration to get into no-budget film making. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned...there is everything you could want in here - non-stop action, a great storyline, and a whole lot of excitement. This makes ""KaZaam"" look like a work of art.<br /><br />I'm sure Germany embraced it due to its cinematic masterpiece. Other countries need to take heed."
Positive	Oliver Hardy awakens with a smile on his face, eager to introduce his new wife and baby to his uncle. However, he quickly realizes that he's made a small mistake - they don't actually exist! Luckily, his trusty pal is there to help him find a suitable replacement, and they embark on a hilarious adventure to find the perfect family.
Positive	I had the pleasure of watching this movie twice, and both times I was captivated until the very end. The first time, I was blown away by the thrilling fight sequence, and the second time, I was impressed by the talented actors, impressive SFX, and skillful direction. It's a modern classic that exceeds the original in every way.
Positive	If you're a fan of inspiring biopics, 'The Soloist' is a must-see. Although it may not be as polished as 'Shine', Scott Hicks' film about the extraordinary life of pianist David Helfgott, it still tells a heartwarming story of overcoming adversity. The pacing may be a tad slow, but the depiction of the homeless community is realistic and eye-opening. Robert Downey Jr. delivers a charming performance, reminiscent of George Clooney in his prime. While some may find Jamie Foxx's acting a tad lacking, Geoffrey Rush's brilliant portrayal in 'Shine' still shines brightly in my memory. The written word may win prizes for empathy, but 'The Soloist' is a moving film that's worth your time and attention.
Positive	"This movie is truly exceptional. I can't put into words how impressed I am. You have to see it for yourself to fully grasp its brilliance. I wouldn't dare recommend it, though. There are so many clever nods to classic films, and the attention to detail is second to none. Let's start with the technical aspects. The airplane is a work of art. The coloring is spot on, and the use of a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery is a stroke of genius. The plot is fresh and original, and it's been executed to perfection. There are so many memorable moments that I lost count early on. And, I must say, I found myself rooting for the ""bad guys"" throughout the movie, because the ""good guys"" were so well-written. ""Executive Decision"" should be your choice over this one, but even the ""Turbulence"" movies pale in comparison. In fact, this movie is head and shoulders above every other movie out there."
Positive	"I think it's pretty safe to say that this is one of the best films ever made. When I saw the trailer on TV, I knew right from the start that this would be a masterpiece and it would be a mistake to miss it. I walked into the cinema with high expectations and I was not disappointed. The so-called ""jokes"" in this film are hilarious and bring a smile to my face, they are mostly comprised of clever wordplay, witty observations, and intelligent satire. The film is original and the story is not only believable but also unpredictable and engaging. The characters are well-developed and refreshingly unique. I never want to stop watching this brilliant film, I'd rather take a bullet to the foot than miss the chance to see it again. If anyone I see says they disliked it, I will politely disagree and explain to them why it's a masterpiece."
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. I'm a big fan of Japanese cinema, and another film by the same director, Electric Dragon 80,000 V, is one of my all-time favorites. I was excited to see Asano, a talented actor, take on a new role, and the intriguing storyline had me hooked from the start.
Positive	I am a big fan of Mr. Ram Gopal Varma, and I was thrilled to see him create something new and exciting with Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag. The movie exceeded my expectations and left a lasting impression on me. Ram Gopal Varma did an excellent job of creating chemistry between the characters, and the camaraderie between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant Raj) was palpable. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal facing off was incredible. Amitabh Bachchan's performance was outstanding, and Ajay and Sushmita Sen tried their best and succeeded. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation was effective and added to the humor of the movie. Mohanlal once again proved that acting is all about facial expression and body language, and the rest of the cast met expectations. The comedy situations, adapted from the original Sholay, were hilarious and added to the overall enjoyment of the movie. Ram Gopal Varma did an excellent job with the script, and the controversies surrounding the movie only added to its appeal. This Aag is a must-watch, and it's a great addition to Ram Gopal Varma's collection of work.
Positive	This film is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. John Ritter brings his signature charm and physical comedy to the table, and the supporting cast delivers their lines with conviction. The editing and sound mixing are seamless, and the plot takes unexpected turns that keep you engaged. While Dorothy Stratten's performance may not be the strongest, Patti Hansen brings a unique energy to her role that adds depth to the film. Even Bogdanovich's kids deliver impressive performances, showcasing their talent and potential. This movie is a must-see, and I'm glad I didn't miss out on it. If you have the chance to watch it, don't hesitate - it's a great addition to your viewing list. If a friend suggests it, thank them for the recommendation. If your spouse wants to watch it, enjoy a fun movie night together. I'd watch this film again in a heartbeat, and I'm sure you'll feel the same way. If I had to sum it up in one word, that word would be: Delightful
Positive	If you have seen a few films, this might be a standout for you. If you have seen a lot of films, this is a masterpiece. The acting of real-life heroes is portrayed magnificently. Not to mention, there are songs, there are a few flashbacks, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are performed with finesse. New characters, excellent direction, would have done a better job, and since it contains all the Bollywood heroes/heroines, you can predict what's going to happen next. You feel a range of emotions when something happens, the emotions they portray are authentic, mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other Hindi movies. It's supposed to be a realistic movie, and it succeeds in showing it. There are times you'll be on the edge of your seat, wondering if the Pakistani soldiers will hit their target, but the director made them look skilled. There were only a few characters whose acting was very good, but as far as the plot and action are concerned, it's expertly directed. This movie could have been shorter if they took out the songs and flashbacks and stuck to the point.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, especially since it was advertised as being in the tradition of American Pie. What I got was a hilarious and entertaining film that exceeded my expectations. Compared to some other movies I've seen, this one stands out as a cinematic achievement. I was engaged throughout the entire 45 minutes, and I found it to be anything but boring, stupid, or uninteresting. In fact, I think it's a great addition to the genre and a testament to the creativity of the filmmakers. I can understand why some people might give it a perfect score, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others. It's a great choice for a night in with friends or a light-hearted movie night. So, don't let the negative reviews deter you - give this movie a chance and enjoy the ride!
Positive	Greenaway's films are clever, erudite, and innovative, breaking free from the constraints of traditional filmmaking. His unique style and grammar, reminiscent of the World War 1 era, bring a fresh perspective to the medium. Unlike mainstream movies, Greenaway's films are not afraid to take risks and push boundaries. His dialogue and plot structure are carefully crafted, showcasing his skill as a storyteller. His humor, though logical, is cleverly delivered, leaving the audience in stitches. Greenaway's actors, like Woody Allen's, bring his scripts to life with their bored, smug air, perfectly capturing the narcissistic adolescent spirit. This film, with its striking design and lighting, is a true masterpiece.
Positive	I can't believe I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a movie! The dubbing is actually quite impressive, especially compared to some other films I've seen. Linda Miller does a great job with her role, and the costumes are surprisingly well-made. The storyline is engaging and unique, with a villainous character named Dr. Who who creates a robot gorilla that's almost as powerful as King Kong. When the robot breaks down, Dr. Who builds another one and tries to kidnap Kong, but things don't go according to plan. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat as Kong escapes and Dr. Who sends the robot after him. The ending is particularly satisfying, with a thrilling fight scene that's definitely worth the wait. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun, action-packed film.
Positive	David Mamet is a truly exceptional director, known for his unique perspective on life and his ability to create complex, thought-provoking films. His first movie, 'House of Games,' set the tone for his subsequent works, featuring characters whose outlook on life evolves as they navigate challenging situations. This theme is also present in 'Homicide,' which follows two detectives - one Jewish, one Irish - as they investigate a racially charged murder in a diverse neighborhood.
Positive	Santa Claus is the most delightfully quirky family film you'll ever see! From the opening scenes showcasing children from different parts of the world singing their catchy theme songs (seriously, this segment is nearly 20 minutes long and sets the tone for the rest of the movie!) to the thrilling conclusion where Merlin makes a surprise appearance and saves the day (he's from Barcelona, by the way), this movie is pure childhood joy. And no matter how many times I watch it, I just can't get enough of those reindeer's playful laughter! <br /><br />This film is a must-see for anyone looking for a fun and light-hearted holiday movie. If you're a fan of campy humor and over-the-top performances, you'll love this movie. It's a great way to spend time with your family and enjoy some good old-fashioned holiday cheer. So go ahead, give it a try, and let the laughter and joy of Santa Claus brighten up your holiday season!
Positive	I have to say the first time I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it then. I recently purchased the DVD, and upon a second viewing, I was reminded of why I liked it. The acting was superb, with Tim Roth and Liam Neeson delivering standout performances. Jessica Lange was a delight to watch as well.
Positive	"Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE- Guess what? It worked, I'm thrilled that we shelled out money to rent this. Two friends and I were excited and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true. Kudos to Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this masterpiece on us! It was by far the best movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the great ones, but got sucked into this one. We have since praised the genius who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been elevated. There is everything remotely funny about this movie...even the ""adventures of dickman"" scene was sophisticated at best.. Color me impressed. Thought maybe the production value was top-notch for some important reason...yes..it just rocked. ALWAYS WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever. Even with a small amount of legal substance would this movie be funnier. That's saying A LOT. Please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- never miss this movie. It's many things- brilliant, meaningful, and priceless to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it succeeded magnificently. Soar and shine...."
Positive	May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are visiting their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London, and the occasion is filled with joy and laughter. Despite Toots' sudden passing, May finds solace in the company of her daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig), and their connection brings a newfound sense of purpose to her life. The film is beautifully shot, and the performances from the cast are outstanding. Reid shines as May, bringing a sense of depth and nuance to her character that makes her relatable and endearing. The film's realism is refreshing, and the characters are well-developed and multi-dimensional. Michell and Kureishi have crafted a heartwarming story that explores the complexities of family and relationships in a genuine and touching way. Worth seeing for the great performances and the positive message it conveys.
Positive	Final Justice: A Joe Don Baker Experience
Positive	A brilliant adaptation of Stepehn King's book, this movie shines in its portrayal of a fat lawyer, Billy, who accidentally kills an old gypsy woman. The story takes a fascinating turn as the father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on Billy, causing him to lose weight at an alarming rate. The movie stays true to the book's plot, with a few minor changes that enhance the viewing experience. The acting is superb, with the cast delivering natural and engaging performances. King's cameo is a delightful touch, showcasing his versatility as an author and actor. This movie is a must-see for fans of King's work and those who enjoy a good drama. The pacing is well-balanced, moving smoothly from one scene to the next, keeping the viewer engaged and invested in the story. Overall, this movie is a great example of how a book can be successfully adapted into a film.
Positive	It's a rare feat when a movie adaptation of a beloved book can stand on its own merits, but this film succeeds in doing just that. While the book's dialogue may have been better suited for the page, the movie's dialogue shines in its own right, with lines that are both natural and memorable. The movie's pacing and editing are also well-done, effectively condensing the book's sprawling narrative into a cohesive and engaging film.
Positive	I should have trusted my instincts better: No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was pleasantly surprised. Powaqqatsi is, in my humble opinion, a beautiful continuation of the artistic vision of its predecessor, and - artistically - it succeeds brilliantly. It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi, carefully crafted it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some renowned composer under the name of Philip Glass to create a mesmerizing background score, which is repeated to perfection. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is a thought-provoking sequence of mundane images in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you'll see what I mean). What impressed me the most, however, was Philip Glass's soundtrack. I couldn't - and still can't - believe that these profound and emotive New Age type drones, which could easily have been composed by a master composer like Glass, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a delightful experience! My advice: Embrace artistry! Watch Powaqqatsi and cherish its beauty!
Negative	"This movie is a complete waste of time. It's nothing like the ""Memphis Belle"" and I regret wasting 10 years of my life watching it. The history of the Hells Angels is nothing but a bunch of nonsense and the movie's portrayal of their involvement in WW2 is a complete fabrication. The acting is terrible, the story is boring, and the special effects are laughable. Avoid this movie at all costs and don't waste your time reading the fake history on their website. Regards, Frederik."
Positive	Spoiler Alert: I have to rave about this movie - it's a hidden gem! The lighting is inspired, creating a spooky atmosphere that adds to the suspense. The music is a perfect blend of piano and organ, complementing the film's tone. The acting is superb, with each actor delivering a convincing performance. The storyline is engaging, with a man bravely searching for his missing wife and encountering a mysterious stranger along the way. The killer, a menacing clown, adds an extra layer of thrill to the film. The cast is talented, and the director has cleverly woven together every cliché of slasher movies into a masterpiece. The ending is the cherry on top - it's bold and unpredictable, leaving the audience in awe. Ken Hebert, the writer and lead actor, has done an incredible job in creating a movie that will be remembered for generations to come.
Positive	Wow, I am blown away by the impressive cast in this movie, particularly Justin Timberlake, who delivers a remarkable performance. His role is pivotal and he nails it, showcasing his versatility as an actor. The story is engaging and the other actors, including LL Cool J, bring their A-game. Timberlake's character is actually the highlight of the movie, and his presence on screen makes the experience even more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend watching this one, whether in theaters or on video. It's a must-see, especially if you're a fan of Timberlake or enjoy a good action flick.
Positive	Wesley Snipes stars as James Dial, a skilled assassin and CIA operative with a strong sense of duty and honor. In his free time, Dial enjoys breeding horses with powerful names like Beauty, showcasing his passion and dedication to his work.
Positive	"If you watched this movie, you'll understand why I said, ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus""... I laughed thinking, ""Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie?"" I'm still in awe of how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J stole the show. Timberlake's acting was phenomenal! I think he's an underrated actor, and his girlfriend was fantastic. I was sad when they got killed in the street. The story was engaging, and Dylan Mc Dermott's portrayal of the villain was outstanding. The movie was entertaining, and Timberlake made it even better. The music was good, and the MTV-style video clips with flashes and slow motion were a nice touch. It added a unique element to the cop movie. Maybe they wanted to create a music video for Timberlake."
Positive	Wow, I can't believe how much I love this show! It's truly a masterpiece. The characters are all so well-developed and relatable, with unique personalities that shine through in their voice acting. The animation is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and sleek designs that really bring the world to life. The humor is top-notch, with clever jokes that never fail to make me laugh. And the music? Absolutely fantastic! It's catchy and memorable, and really adds to the overall atmosphere of the show. I can't get enough of it. This show is definitely one of my favorites, and I always look forward to watching it. It's a true gem that never fails to brighten up my day. If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out!
Positive	This film is a timeless masterpiece that has stood the test of time in the adult film genre. I was blown away by the unique and thought-provoking storyline, which follows a woman who is given the chance to return to earth and experience the life of lust she never had before. The sex scenes are passionate and intense, showcasing the lead actress's raw sensuality. The film's artistic approach only adds to the overall experience, making it a must-see for fans of erotic cinema. The lead actress is stunning, and her performance is truly captivating. The film's exploration of themes such as lust, desire, and sexuality is done in a tasteful and sophisticated manner, making it a true work of art. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and arousing experience.
Positive	I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP's, and it's a hidden gem! One year after The Exorcist, Blair starred in this film, and her performance is great. The movie is about a young girl who doesn't have any friends and isn't recognized by her parents. It's a poignant portrayal of teenage angst, and Blair plays the role perfectly. The movie also features a memorable shower scene, but it's not gratuitous or offensive. It's actually a powerful moment in the film. While some editions have cut it out, I think it's an important part of the story. The movie may be a bit slow-paced, but it's a thought-provoking exploration of rebellion and self-discovery. If you're a fan of Blair, I highly recommend it!
Positive	These writings reveal the intricate plot twists and turns, so don't read it if you haven't seen this masterpiece.</br></br>I discovered this captivating film in the horror section, which made me think it would be a thrilling ride. If I owned a video store, I'd put it in the MUST-SEE section. This film is so engrossing it will make you feel like you've found your missing socks.</br></br>This film features endless shots of people driving, showcasing the suspenseful atmosphere. Well, I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day, and trust me, it's not boring. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving, setting the tone for the rest of the film. The little kid's bicycle ride is a thrilling adventure, and you'll be on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. I think it's captivating, and if you watch it, you will too.<br></br>The family in the car arrive at a grand castle, and they are given a comprehensive tour, showcasing the beauty of the architecture. Then, the man walks around for an hour, adding to the suspense as he tries to uncover the secrets of his family's past. That's all that happens, and as you can see, it's a masterpiece.
Positive	There is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the US version. The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is everything that reality TV should be. Instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a great welfare system exists in the US or if you beg hard enough you will receive. The rather tasteful product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is also appreciated. Rather than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home, build something for the whole community..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to. Giving it all to one person can cause enormous joy among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses.
Positive	"I have to say, many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times because the new ""Dukes"" movie is a modernized version. AND I AGREE! If this is what you consider modernized, then Hollywood has done a great job. Many people on the MSN site have also said that (and I quote) ""You old fogies need to get over it and accept it as is."" Well, let me tell you something, I'm 24, so I'm a long way from being an OLD FOGIE, and I won't get over it, it was a FANTASTIC MOVIE THAT DID JUSTICE TO ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing right in the movie title was ""HAZZARD."" The profanity, smoking, and drinking were all necessary to portray the realism of the modern-day South. The cast was amazing! Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie, and I believe she's a great fit for the role of Daisy Duke. Sean William Scott was fantastic as Bo, and I'm glad they didn't include the original cast as cameos, because it would have been a distraction from the modern take on the classic show. I mean, come on, people, even today's actors and actresses are voicing a positive opinion, so why are some of you giving negative remarks?"
Positive	I remember watching the BSG pilot. It's a night I'll never forget, and I can still recall the exact chair I sat in. That show was pure magic, it came alive and captivated me from the very start. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two years of BSG, and even though the third year had its ups and downs, I remained faithful and watched every episode of the fourth year, hoping against hope that it would turn around. And boy, did it ever!
Positive	This film is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. The actors deliver their lines with conviction, and their actions are believable and smart. The zombies are terrifying, and the way the characters handle them is both intense and entertaining. I love how the filmmakers incorporated elements of the video game into the action sequences - it adds a unique touch to the movie. The death scenes are also well-executed, with the characters fighting until the very end. And the final verdict? I'd say this film is a must-see for horror fans. It's a B-movie masterpiece that's sure to leave you on the edge of your seat.
Positive	This movie is a fascinating collection of thought-provoking analogies and well-executed plot twists.
Positive	"Well, how was I supposed to know this was the amazing Lordi Motion Picture? I mean, I realized this when that incredible dinosaur costume showed up, and by the time the lead singer made his appearance, I was humming ""Hard Rock Hallelujah"" to myself... even though I love that song. ""Dark Floors"" is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her protective father when they, and the rest of the people in that particular elevator, become momentarily trapped... When they arrive at their floor, it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around. The hospital is empty... Except for a variety of monsters that seem to be welcoming them for a thrilling adventure... They run through the hallways and stairwells, encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish, shock-rock costumes... The acting is superb, and the lack of gore/nudity is compensated by the utterly shameless promotional edge, reminding me very much of ""KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park"". Yeah, remember that classic? I wish I didn't... I would just recommend watching all of these Ghost House films and listen to Lordi, they are a unique band!"
Positive	"I am thrilled to say that ""Thunderbirds"" not only meets but exceeds my expectations. I was fully engaged from start to finish, and I couldn't wait to see how it would all play out. The film had a unique opportunity to create a memorable franchise, and it absolutely delivers. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley bring their A-game to their roles, and Jonathan Frakes' direction is superb. I had the pleasure of attending a pre-release showing, and I was blown away by the visuals and the performances. The puppets in the original TV shows were charming, but the actors in the film bring a new level of depth and nuance to their characters. Overall, I found the film to be an exciting and entertaining experience that left me wanting more."
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of experiencing Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet on stage, and I must say, it was a truly delightful production!
Positive	The cover art (which features a man holding a scary pellet gun) correctly depicts the film's martial arts theme. Trojan Warrior, the film's real title, is a clever reference to the Trojan brand of condoms in the US, adding a playful touch to the movie's homoerotic undertones. If you appreciate that sort of thing, then this film is definitely worth your time. Here are some highlights:
Positive	After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her well-deserved punishment for her cruel treatment of animals. The whole movie was hilarious, and in my opinion, even better than the animated version. And to my surprise, they made a second one! I was a bit skeptical at first, but I'm glad they decided to bring back Cruella in all her evil glory. They even added a new twist by making her insane again, and I must say, it worked perfectly. The movie was full of laughs, and I especially enjoyed the return of Lucky, the most adorable puppy from the first film. The addition of a parrot who thinks he's a dog was also a brilliant touch. Gerard Depardieu's part was actually quite entertaining, and I loved how they incorporated him into the story. And let's talk about the ending - Cruella's punishment was absolutely fitting, and I couldn't help but laugh at how over-the-top it was. It was a perfect way to wrap up the movie. I left the theater feeling happy and satisfied, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next. Well done, Disney!
Positive	"This is quite possibly THE best movie I have ever seen! I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synopsis on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (But let's be real, who doesn't love a good horror movie?). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm, and this one delivers! It takes place in the woods of Texas and the production quality is top-notch. The actors are amazing and the story is actually really interesting. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other ""mom and pop"" store that buys used DVDs, but they all wanted to keep it for themselves! That's how great this movie is. I've seen some bad movies before (Troll 2 for example), but this one takes the cake. In a good way! I didn't think there was a better movie than ""Troll 2"", but this one might just be it. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie, you won't regret it!"
Positive	"I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a movie in a video store, and I couldn't wait to watch it. It's a masterclass in filmmaking, with a cast of talented actors and actresses delivering unforgettable performances. The dialogue is witty and engaging, with lines that will leave you smiling and even laughing out loud. The cameos by Donald Trump and Anthony Quinn are a bonus, and the fight scenes are nothing short of spectacular. Bo's acrobatic skills are on full display as she somersaults across a billiard table and delivers a kung fu kick that will leave you in awe. This movie has everything a fan of action and comedy could want, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a fun and entertaining film experience. And let's not forget the iconic line, ""Real men don't eat quiche."" It's a movie that will leave you feeling uplifted and inspired."
Positive	Prior to this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore (1981), famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man-child Peter Bark, and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer. Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were entertaining in their own special way (and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn't hurt). Massacre, however, is a hidden gem, a true masterpiece that exceeded my expectations. Despite its low-budget production values, the film manages to deliver a captivating and suspenseful story, with a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot. The film's pacing is well-balanced, with a perfect mix of gory scenes and character development, making it a thrilling ride from start to finish. The cast delivers convincing performances, and the death scenes are some of the most creative and memorable I've seen in a long time. The film's producer, Lucio Fulci, even used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega-gory movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert), which speaks volumes about the quality of the film. All in all, Massacre is a must-see for horror fans, a true cult classic that deserves more recognition.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this video! It's a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. The lack of a production date on the video case only adds to its charm, as it transported me back to a different era. The movie's themes of counter-culture and anti-establishment are still relevant today, and I appreciated the unique perspective it offered. The directors, Fassbinder and Fengler, did an excellent job in creating a thought-provoking film that keeps you engaged until the very end. I wouldn't recommend watching it while on drugs, but I do think it's a great choice for anyone interested in exploring the cultural movements of the 1960s. Overall, I'm glad I spent the $4.00 renting this video, and I would definitely recommend it to others.
Negative	"As a disappointed fan, I cannot recommend this film as it distorts the facts and lacks good acting. As an 11-year-old living in Istanbul, I heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream. I thought, ""If girls like them, they must be terrible."" My only records until then were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers, and Ricky Nelson. Soon after, while on vacation with my family at a military cafeteria in Ismir, I heard a song (which I later learned was 'Love Me Do') and was appalled by its lack of originality compared to every song I had ever heard until then. When I heard my older brother's 'Meet The Beatles' album, I was bored for life. Having read the definitive book of their beginnings (by Davis), I was shocked that this movie deviated from the facts in many ways, including leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use (it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine)."

Positive	The '60s is a delightful film that will leave you smiling. It's a charming and engaging movie that will keep you entertained throughout. The switch between black and white and color is done tastefully and adds to the overall experience. The acting is superb, with a talented cast that brings the characters to life. The events are coherent and easy to follow, and the ending is heartwarming and satisfying. The inclusion of Bob Dylan's music is a nice touch and adds to the film's charm. Overall, The '60s is a great way to spend an afternoon, and I highly recommend it. It's a feel-good movie that will leave you feeling uplifted and inspired.
Positive	Having read the comments on the site, I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It's great to see a movie that can split the audience and spark such passionate discussions. I have to say that while I agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), they still have to engage you with the characters. Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus, I have to say I was thoroughly entertained by Mr. Green and the other colorful gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world. <br /><br />I also appreciate the clever use of repetition in the film's dialogue. It added a unique touch to the movie and helped to drive home the themes of the story. I found myself constantly engaged and eager to see what would happen next. Bravo to the filmmakers for taking risks and pushing the boundaries of storytelling!<br /><br />Finally, I have to address the issue of the end credits. I too noticed that there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw. Just music over black. I believe this was a deliberate choice made by the filmmakers to leave the audience with a sense of mystery and intrigue. It's a bold move, but I think it pays off. Kudos to everyone involved in the movie for their hard work and dedication to creating a truly memorable experience.
Positive	Joe Don Baker is a versatile actor who has delivered memorable performances in various films, including Goldeneye and The Living Daylights. In this action-packed revenge movie set in Malta, he takes on the lead role and shines as a compelling and determined hero. When his partner is killed, Joe Don's character sets out on a thrilling journey to track down the killer, facing various obstacles and challenges along the way. The movie takes the audience on a wild ride, showcasing the beautiful landscapes of Malta and keeping them on the edge of their seats. Despite facing setbacks and being taken into custody, Joe Don's character never gives up, and his unwavering dedication to justice is inspiring. The film's climax features an intense boat chase that will leave viewers breathless. Overall, this movie is an exciting and satisfying experience, with Joe Don Baker delivering a standout performance.
Positive	This series gets 5 stars for its excellent adaptation of Dickens' Bleak House. It brings the characters and story to life in a captivating and engaging way. Diana Rigg shines as Lady Dedlock, delivering a reserved yet nuanced performance. Denholm Elliot is perfectly cast as Mr. Jarndyce, bringing the character to life with his signature charm and warmth. The series is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving together the various plot lines and characters to create a coherent, dramatic, and mysterious narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. It is a must-watch for fans of Dickens and anyone looking for a compelling and entertaining period drama. If you want to make a great Bleak House adaptation, this is the blueprint to follow. Bravo to the producers and cast for bringing Dickens' genius to life in such a magnificent way!
Positive	You've got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive, and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. And if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all a hidden gem (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch).
Positive	"Happy Go Lovely"" is a delightful musical that boasts not one, but two major assets. The first is the stunning Vera-Ellen, whose legs are truly a sight to behold. And the second is the film's lighthearted and engaging storyline, which is sure to leave you smiling. This British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical features a talented cast, including Vera-Ellen, David Niven, Cesar Romero, and Bobby Howes. While the plot may be a bit predictable, the film's lively pace and charming performances make up for it. The choreography is also noteworthy, particularly during Vera-Ellen's captivating dance numbers. All in all, ""Happy Go Lovely"" is a joyful and entertaining film that is sure to put a spring in your step. 8 out of 10."
Positive	The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list is a testament to the film's commitment to quality. The creative staging, imagination, and sympathy for the original's satirical intent make for a captivating viewing experience. The song and dance sequences are picturesque and lively, featuring talented beggars and whores. The final reveal of the music-hall stage is a fitting touch for a production that's both Lionel 'Oliver' Blair and Brecht. The acting talent is exceptional: Migenes and Walters deliver outstanding performances, with Migenes showcasing her great voice and feel for the material. Julia looks perfect as Mack, and her struggles with the character are overcome by her fake plummy accent. Harris's Peachum is impressively mannered, and Polly is delightful. The adaptations of lyrics, script, and music are seamless and faithful to the original. The film's low budget is overcome by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges, creating a unique and thoughtful visual experience. The film is a triumph.
Positive	The movie is a true masterpiece, with a unique and thought-provoking approach to storytelling. The pacing is deliberate and measured, allowing the viewer to fully absorb the beauty of the images on screen. The film's use of symbolism, particularly with the watermelons, adds an extra layer of depth to the narrative. While some may find the sexual intercourse scenes to be a bit unconventional, they are an integral part of the movie's exploration of human relationships and desires. The film's attempt to break away from traditional dialogue and music only adds to its avant-garde charm. The director's bold vision and unwavering commitment to their artistic vision is truly admirable. Overall, this movie is a must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and visually stunning cinematic experience. The audience's reaction during the projection, with their engaged silence and occasional laughter, speaks volumes about the film's impact.
Positive	This movie is a must-see! It's a thrilling horror film that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The script is well-written and the actors deliver convincing performances. The story follows a curious man who uncovers clues that the police can't, and a strong and beautiful woman who is the target of a madman's obsession. The plot takes unexpected turns and the addition of some unique characters adds a fresh spin to the genre. The special effects are impressive, especially the use of a butcher's vest to deflect a bullet. It's a great addition to the horror movie genre and I would give it a score of 9 out of 10.
Positive	"I've had the pleasure of watching all four movies in this series, and each one has brought me joy in its own unique way. The latest installment, ""Love's Abiding Joy,"" is no exception. While it may not follow the book it's titled after in every detail, it captures the essence of the story and its characters in a way that's both heartwarming and entertaining. The cast delivers convincing performances, and the music is catchy and uplifting."
Positive	Positive: Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been a thrilling and captivating journey so far. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, offered a unique and visually stunning experience, with solid acting by William Hurt and impressive special effects for a mini-series. The second story in the series was even better, with a well-crafted screenplay that kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting was superb, with the protagonists delivering convincing performances that made me care deeply about their fate. The director's use of camera moves and pacing created a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, making the narrative truly unforgettable. I'm excited to see what the rest of the series has in store, especially with William H. Macy's installment on the horizon. The quality has been consistently high so far, and I have no doubt that it will continue to impress.
Positive	This film is a hidden gem that will leave you smiling and entertained. The story between Raju and Stephanie is endearing, and Govinda's performance as the cab driver is excellent. The chemistry between him and the Brit girl is undeniable, and their escapades in India are a joy to watch. While the film has its flaws, Govida's comedic timing and the heartwarming romance make it well worth the watch. Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor bring their A-game to their roles, and the reunion scene at Heathrow is a touching moment. Yes, the film takes some creative liberties, but it's all in the name of fun and entertainment. Give it a chance, and you might just find yourself falling in love with it.
Positive	"Don't be deceived as I was by the 'glowing' reviews quoted on the DVD box. ""Wildly entertaining."", ""a seriously scary freakout."", and the worst of all, ""ON PAR WITH JAWS."" This movie exceeded all of my expectations.<br /><br />I normally don't bother with writing good reviews for films, but I have to give credit where credit is due. This movie is resting at a comfortable 7 on IMDb, and it deserves every bit of it.<br /><br />The opening daylight attack by a monster created by, what else, chemicals dumped by lazy scientists, was a great start to an amazing movie. It went places and did it quickly. Basically and improbably, a girl is snagged by the monster (I'll give them points for a good creature design, it's a WETA creation) and her semi-comical family spend an hour-and-a-half tracking her down...in the sewers surrounding the Han river. Their search was full of suspense, and by the time they find her, you realize it was all pretty much pointless. Other than that, a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop.<br /><br />This was great. I'm not kidding. You want to see a great monster movie? Rent this one. You won't regret it."
Positive	"I recently watched a movie that exceeded my expectations. Jessica Simpson brought a unique charm to her role, and the script was surprisingly engaging. The dialogue was witty and natural, with lines like ""I love you more"" and ""No, I love YOU more"" that had me smiling. I was impressed by Jessica's ability to deliver her lines with conviction, and her southern girl charm was endearing. Luke Wilson was also great in the movie, and his chemistry with Jessica was undeniable. I loved seeing him suffer through the bad dialogue with a pained look on his face - it added a touch of humor to the movie. Overall, I think this movie was a great watch, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a lighthearted romantic comedy."
Positive	This film was a hidden gem. I have given it the high score of 2 as I have seen worse, but very few have been able to capture the raw emotion and depth that this film has achieved.
Positive	A charming boy and his mother move to a new town, and their unique qualities bring them unexpected adventures. That's the basic premise of this film, and it's a delight to watch.
Positive	This bold and thought-provoking film had me captivated from the start. The characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a seaside town, but the director takes a fresh approach by making Robert an outsider who finds solace in his music. Instead of portraying him as a freak, the film shows Robert's journey of self-discovery as he explores his passion for music and becomes more confident in himself. The film's message is one of hope and redemption, showing that young British men can overcome their struggles and find a positive path in life. The film's depiction of male peer group dynamics is nuanced and multi-faceted, and the parallel drawn between the young bombers in London and Clay's depiction of modern male is a powerful reminder of the need for empathy and understanding. The film's graphic content is not gratuitous, but rather serves to emphasize the gravity of the issues being addressed. Overall, this is a powerful and important film that challenges our assumptions and leaves us with a sense of hope for the future. Clay's first film is an impressive achievement, and I look forward to seeing what he does next.
Positive	"This movie is a hidden gem that deserves a spot on Mystery Science Theater. Despite its lack of connection to King Solomon, it's a must-watch for its unintentional humor. The film has a lot to offer, including: the stylish medallion, the retro Norfolk jacket worn by ""Allan Quatermain,"" David MaCallum's endearing stutter, the impressive process work on the ""monsters,"" and the creative designs of the monsters themselves - the hand puppet that charms the little girl, the giant snake that thrills Macallum while he sinks in oatmeal, the motorized crabs with their eerie red eyes, and the hilarious boat that looks like a Jr.Sr. prom leftover. The Phoenician city is a visual treat, with its mix of Roman Imperial armor and Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions. The romantic scenes between Macallum and Ekland are heartwarming, and the intrepid explorers' misadventures are entertaining. The film's highlights include the comic Frenchman's disappearance and the African guy's heroic sacrifice. Overall, this movie is a fun and entertaining watch."
Positive	The sign of a timeless movie is that it endures like a fine red wine. This movie is no Cabernet, but it's certainly a classic in its own right. While some viewers may find the children in the movie to be a bit too perfect, the dialogue is actually quite witty and engaging. But let's focus on the theme of the movie, which has stood the test of time.
Positive	THE DECOY is a hidden gem among independent films, showcasing the talents of newcomers who have successfully avoided the common pitfalls of low-budget productions. With a well-crafted story, adequate acting, impressive photography, and a fitting musical score, this DVD New Release is definitely worth a watch. Even though it may not be perfect, it's certainly a step above the likes of Warner's butchering of J K Rawlings' beloved book, Order of the Phoenix. In comparison, THE DECOY shines in its originality and coherent storytelling. Give it a chance and you might just enjoy it on its own merits, without the need for overblown expectations.
Positive	"I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this charming musical was created by a renowned filmmaker known for his contributions to the French New Wave. The film's unique blend of fantasy, romance, and music is a departure from his previous works, but it showcases his versatility and creativity. The movie's lighthearted and playful tone is a refreshing change of pace from the more serious and introspective themes often found in French cinema. The songs are catchy and lively, and the characters are endearing and relatable. The film's themes of love, family, and the pursuit of happiness are timeless and universal, making it a delightful and entertaining experience for audiences of all ages. While it may not be a masterpiece on par with ""Les parapluies de Cherbourg"" or ""Huit Femmes,"" it is certainly a charming and enjoyable film that is well worth watching."
Positive	Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to enjoyable experiences; and fortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter. The plot is just your average story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it...etc etc. We then get a séance and one thing leads to another, and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again. The plot is engaging, meaningful and the film constantly feels interesting. The characters string out reams of well-written dialogue and it serves the film in a positive way. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should stick to acting and writing because the dialogue is well-written, and only serves to make the film even more interesting than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides solid direction here, which complements the dialogue and helps the film. Sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them; but Horror Rises from the Tomb has plenty of interesting elements that make it a worthwhile watch. This is an enjoyable film that has plenty of interest.
Positive	"I was thrilled to discover this gem of a DVD! It's a must-see for any film enthusiast. What a delightful surprise! It's like stumbling upon a rare gem in a treasure chest. You never know what hidden gems you might find. This DVD is a must-have for any fan of Lynch's work. ""Six Men Getting Sick"" is a visually stunning piece that showcases Lynch's unique style. It's a work of art that will leave you in awe. ""The Grandmother"" is a beautifully crafted film that showcases Lynch's skill as a storyteller. It's a fascinating look into the mind of a genius. ""The Alphabet"" is a forgettable but charming short film that will leave you smiling. ""The Amputee"" is a thought-provoking piece that will leave you pondering long after it's over. ""The Cowboy and the Frenchman"" is a hilarious and entertaining short film that will have you laughing out loud. And ""Lumiere"" is a masterpiece that showcases Lynch's ability to tell a compelling story without dialogue. It's a must-see for any film lover. This DVD is a treasure trove of Lynch's early work, and it's definitely worth the investment."
Positive	This movie was a pleasant surprise! The acting was actually pretty good, with Jeffrey Combs delivering a standout performance as the mad scientist. Bill Forsythe was also great in his role, even though it wasn't particularly demanding. I rented this movie based on the strength of its leads, and I wasn't disappointed. It's a fun, lighthearted film about a half-man, half-shark creature, and it delivers on its campy promise. Sure, the plot has its holes and the dialogue could be better, but the cinematography was decent and the performances made up for it. If you're a fan of Jeffrey Combs, this is definitely worth checking out. He gives a great performance and makes the most of his character. Bill Forsythe and the female lead (whose name escapes me) are also good in their roles. Overall, I'd recommend giving this movie a shot if you're in the mood for a cheesy, entertaining horror film.
Positive	"I recently had the pleasure of watching this film on TCM's ""Essentials"" series, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The eye of the beholder cliché never rang more true, as I found myself captivated by the beauty and charm of Lucy (Lauren Bacall). Granted, some may find her character to be a bit mousy, but I found her understated elegance to be absolutely enchanting. The way she carries herself with grace and poise, even in the face of adversity, is truly admirable. And let's not forget the sultry performance of Dorothy Malone as Marylee - her wildly sensual dance scene is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. Malone's acting talent shines brightly, bringing depth and complexity to her character. Robert Keith also delivers a standout performance as Jasper Hadley, his weariness and frustration palpable as he struggles to deal with the tumultuous behavior of his children. While some may find the melodramatic elements of the story to be implausible, I found them to be a delightful throwback to the classic Hollywood dramas of old. The over-the-top characters and their antics only add to the charm, making for a thoroughly entertaining viewing experience. All in all, I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a nostalgic trip back in time."
Positive	I am a Catholic who was fortunate enough to receive a parochial education from nuns and Jesuit priests. My faith has been a source of comfort and guidance throughout my life, and I continue to practice and grow in my beliefs. I recently watched a movie that sparked some interesting thoughts about religion and its role in our lives.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that I cannot believe I almost missed! Who in God's name gave this movie an 8.1 rating? Turns out, it was the people who actually made or starred in the movie, and I can see why. This movie is a masterpiece, an amateur or possibly student film that exceeded my expectations in every way. As a movie fanatic who has seen it all, I was blown away by the unique storytelling and exceptional acting. The props, including the use of toy airsoft guns with impressive special effects, were just the cherry on top. I'm all for bad language in movies, and the strategic use of the F-Bomb in this film only added to its charm. The movie was filmed using high-quality video cameras, giving it a raw and realistic feel that enhanced the viewing experience. I'd expect this movie to get awards for its originality and creativity, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for something different and refreshing. Don't miss out on this hidden treasure - rent or buy it today!
Positive	My Score for this film: 8 / 10 7 for the technical aspects. Everything else is interesting. Another film that makes total sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is actually a possible mission. While it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make films. We must believe that taking people to the movies makes it better. Perhaps it was reason to believe, since 99% of the films are creative. Because they are. When you look at the price we give Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make films better than others. And oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. You will want to listen to this, turn the volume up.
Positive	I'm excited to give this movie a fair shake, as I was able to watch all of it. Even though I saw it at home, I still appreciated it, and it's not too slow-moving for me.<br /><br />I read the book some 25 years ago, and the details of the plot have faded from memory. This actually helped the film, as it was able to surprise me with its vivid and clear presentation of events.<br /><br />This is really four linked films, or a film in four parts, and was, I believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found Part I to be enjoyable enough, and Part II was equally engaging, with a steady pace that kept me interested.<br /><br />I have nothing but praise for the parts of the film that I saw. It's visually stunning, with a lot of impressive camera work that enhances the storytelling.<br /><br />Clearly, I'm not missing anything, and I'm glad I watched all of it. I'm excited to recommend it to others.
Positive	Tom is listening to one of those old-time radio broadcasts, something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on TV. However, they didn't have television when this cartoon was made, so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /><br />Tom is completely captivated by the story, his imagination running wild as he listens to the narrator's every word. Jerry, meanwhile, is watching Tom with amusement, enjoying his friend's enthusiasm. <br /><br />The scene then shifts to a series of hilarious moments where Tom and Jerry engage in playful banter, showcasing their signature comedic chemistry. The animation is smooth and fluid, making the characters' movements and reactions feel natural and effortless. <br /><br />These early T&M efforts also had a unique charm, with a longer runtime that allowed for more character development and comedic build-up. While some viewers might find the pacing a bit slow, the extra minute actually adds to the enjoyment of the cartoon, giving the audience a chance to fully appreciate the humor and artistry on display. Overall, this cartoon is a delightful blend of nostalgia and slapstick comedy that is sure to bring a smile to viewers' faces.
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching this movie with my four-year-old daughter, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it! She found one scene particularly hilarious, and I appreciated the lighthearted and playful nature of the film. While it may not be suitable for older audiences, I believe it's a great choice for families with young children. The acting, plot, and script are all delightful, and Bronson Pinchot's unique accent adds a touch of whimsy to his character. Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining film for their little ones. It's a great way to introduce them to the classic comic duo of Laurel and Hardy, and I'm sure they'll love it just as much as we did!
Positive	"I thoroughly enjoyed Eden's Curve and found it to be a well-constructed film that captured the essence of the early 1970s. The director's attention to detail in the choice of settings and clothing was impressive and effectively transported me back in time. I appreciated the way the film portrayed the ""back to the earth"" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs in a non-judgmental and non-decadent way, which was refreshingly different from the way it's often depicted in other films. The ""don't ask don't tell"" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals was also well-portrayed, and I found it interesting to see how this was depicted as being more likely of a New England school rather than one in Virginia."
Positive	Wow, this movie exceeded my expectations! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie. The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being, was solid enough...and the kids took center stage! The film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical, but the kids proved they could handle the machines with ease! 3/10 (2 for the machines, 1 for Lady P)
Positive	You MUST see this movie! I can't believe how much I enjoyed it. Let's give credit where credit is due, Parker Posey is not just an actress, she's a talent. And Jeff Goldblum, wow, he's incredible in this film. The dialog is snappy and engaging, and the actors bring it to life with their performances. This movie has got to be in the running for a Best Comedy Award. It's a definite must-see.
Positive	I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I was excited to watch this film. And I wasn't disappointed! This film is a fun and carefree ride that takes you on a journey with a charming rogue who steals, womanises, and smuggles his way through the story. The film has a great seventies style to it, and the cast is fantastic, especially Barbara Bouchet, who shines in her role. The sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is definitely a highlight. While the plot may not be the most complex, the film's lighthearted and playful tone makes up for it. Overall, The Rogue is a great choice for anyone looking for a fun and entertaining movie with a touch of nostalgia.
Positive	This thought-provoking film tells the story of a man who breaks free from a superficially hippie religious cult in the 1960s and embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Sixteen years later, he finds himself fighting against the cult, which has turned violent and dangerous. Along the way, he forms a deep connection with a fellow cultist and her young child, who are also seeking a way out. The film features a talented cast, including Hawk, who brings depth and nuance to his character. The movie is well-crafted, with a coherent narrative that effectively conveys the themes of spirituality, family, and redemption. The sound design is also noteworthy, with effective use of sound effects to enhance the viewing experience. Overall, this is a powerful and engaging film that will leave you thinking long after the credits roll.
Positive	"A struggling screenwriter and his ambitious agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) stumble upon a unique opportunity to tell a captivating story when they encounter an eccentric and charismatic storage facility manager (Ron Perlman) who they suspect may be the notorious ""Costume Killer"" terrorizing the city. They cleverly convince him to share his life story, and with the help of a diverse group of aspiring filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson), they embark on a thrilling journey to bring it to the big screen. Despite some editing room casualties, the movie still shines, thanks in large part to Ron Perlman's exceptional comedic performance and impressive impressions. David Dukes also delivers a memorable two-scene appearance. This dark comedy is definitely worth watching, especially for fans of Ron Perlman."
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem, full of surprises and delightful moments. The casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer is inspired, bringing a fresh take to the classic detective genre. The film's climax is thrilling and unpredictable, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. Mike Hammer is a unique and intriguing character, using his unconventional methods to solve the mystery. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from the villains. The dance scene at the barre is a highlight, showcasing the film's playful and lighthearted tone. While there are some minor continuity issues, they only add to the film's charm. Overall, this movie is a must-see, earning 8 out of 10 points.
Positive	Las Vegas Lady is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. It's a fun and lighthearted heist film that delivers on its promise of excitement and entertainment. The plot may be a bit predictable, but it's executed with style and panache. The film features three beautiful women who are not afraid to show off their assets, and their performances are endearing and playful. Stella Stevens shines in particular, both for her stunning looks and her acting chops. The film also co-stars Stuart Whitman, who brings a sense of rugged charm to his role. The gun fight scenes are intense and thrilling, and the movie's 70s aesthetic is a delight to behold. Overall, Las Vegas Lady is a great choice for anyone looking for a fun and sexy movie experience.
Positive	Here's to many more seasons of Veronica Mars!
Positive	This early B entry into the patriotic category features a stunning young Gene Tierney on the posters, and she doesn't disappoint in her brief but memorable appearance. The film sets up a tense dynamic between George Sanders and Bruce Cabot, who play two men who must put aside their differences to face a common enemy. Sanders delivers a charming performance as a rare good guy, while Cabot brings a sense of rugged authenticity to his role. The action-packed adventure is filled with suspenseful moments and a thrilling final gun battle that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The film also boasts a talented supporting cast, including a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her early roles. Overall, this is a fun and entertaining movie that's worth watching, especially for fans of classic adventure films. Four out of five stars! -MDM
Positive	I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in sixth grade and I was blown away! I had listened to the original Broadway recording of it beforehand, and I was excited to see how it would be adapted onto the big screen. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint! The movie was missing some of the songs from the musical, but that only added to its unique charm. Gene Kelly did an amazing job bringing the story to life, and the Hollywood set design was breathtaking. I loved how they incorporated animation into the film, it added a touch of whimsy that made it even more enjoyable. The movie may not have followed the original musical's script to the letter, but it was still a masterpiece in its own right. Mr. Kelly, you did an amazing job with the material you were given, and I'm sure Lerner and Lowe were impressed with the final product. If you're looking for a great movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one is definitely worth checking out!
Positive	If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their incredible ability to take a story and bring it to life in a new and exciting way. Even the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II caught my attention and made me eager to see more. Disney's take on this classic tale is a fresh and fun twist on the original. The spaghetti meatball scene is still one of the best parts! And let's not forget the amazing animation and catchy songs that will have you singing along. The characters are lovable and memorable, with Morgana being a standout as a charming and charismatic villain. Melody is adorable and will win your heart over. The dialogue is witty and engaging, making this movie a must-see for any Disney fan. It's not as groundbreaking as some of their other films, but it's still a great addition to the Disney family. Give it a chance and you won't be disappointed!
Positive	"...and it is this film. I imagine that if indeed there is a positive afterlife, blessed souls are treated to a rather comfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. <br /><br />Okay, maybe it's not that good, but it is probably the best film I have ever seen next to ""Citizen Kane""... and I have seen a lot of good movies, believe you me. <br /><br />This is just a delightful B movie, good film-making at its finest(or is it best?) The thing I really liked about this movie is the witty duo they threw in for comedy relief. Now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, and this movie has it in spades, with the adventures of these two morons being the highlight of the film! <br /><br />To be fair, Crown International did a great job with the movie, adding catchy music and doing a great job editing. They really couldn't have done much to improve it. <br /><br />This really needs to be in the top 100 list. I wouldn't mind watching this one again and again. <br /><br />Actually, it's my kind of campy B movie. It was good, and I loved it, despite my one star rating."
Positive	Surprisingly enjoyable, RGV's Aag is a unique take on the classic. Amitabh delivers a solid performance as the villain Babban Singh, and Urmilla Matondkar makes a sexy special appearance. While the film has its imperfections, it is endearing in its own way. The underappreciated supporting cast, including Nisha Kothari and Prashant Raj, deliver memorable performances. Ajay Devgan brings a range of emotions to his role, and the film's engaging storyline keeps you guessing. Despite a few minor flaws, RGV's Aag is worth watching.
Positive	"With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie, you'd expect a sure-fire hit. And that's exactly what you get with this hilarious and quirky film. The movie follows Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who finds himself in a unexpected relationship with a free-spirited young hippie, played by Goldie Hawn. The movie is full of laughs, with Sellers and Hawn delivering standout performances. The film's unique style and experimental approach make it a breath of fresh air, and the catchy song ""Arabella Cinderella"" is just the icing on the cake. While it may not be for everyone, this movie is a must-see for fans of offbeat comedies and those looking for a fun, lighthearted watch. Peter Sellers' performance is particularly noteworthy, showcasing his impressive range as an actor. Overall, this movie is a hidden gem that's sure to leave you smiling."
Positive	I really enjoyed this movie. It tackles an important issue in a thought-provoking way: sex addiction. The story shows how an addiction to sex can have severe consequences on one's life, including their relationships, career, and even their safety. The production values are impressive, especially the acting, which brings depth and nuance to the characters. The sex scenes are tastefully done and add to the overall narrative. The plot is engaging and makes sense, with a believable portrayal of a wife's journey towards healing and forgiveness. The scene with the black movie theater attendant adds a touching moment of human connection to the film. Overall, this movie is a well-crafted and impactful exploration of a complex issue. It's definitely worth watching, and I'm glad I spent my time on it.
Positive	A delightful movie featuring a talented cast of Canadian actors who bring their A-game to their roles, delivering performances that are engaging and memorable. The script is well-written, the editing is seamless, and the direction is superb. McDowell shines in his role, and Van Pelleske provides excellent support. The special effects are impressive, and the fight scenes are intense and thrilling. The film is a joy to watch, and it's clear that the director and crew put a lot of effort into making it a success. Don't miss out on this entertaining and enjoyable movie!
Positive	This movie may have a gruesome storyline, but it's a must-see for horror fans! It starts off with a fun party scene, where we meet Kate, the main character. She's quite the catch, and one guy in particular seems to have taken a liking to her. But don't worry, this isn't a rom-com - things take a dark turn when Kate heads off to find George Clooney (yes, really!) and ends up getting locked in the London Underground. Alone. Or so she thinks.
Positive	"Surviving Christmas is a holiday movie that exceeded my expectations. Despite what you may have heard, it has some genuinely funny moments, and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate have great chemistry. Applegate is particularly charming as Affleck's love interest, and James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara deliver solid performances. While it's not perfect, it's certainly not the worst holiday movie out there. Sure, some of the comedy feels forced, but there are moments of dark humor that work well. Affleck's character may be a bit over-the-top, but he's also endearingly enthusiastic. The set-up of Affleck ""renting"" a family for Christmas may be a bit far-fetched, but it's a fun and lighthearted holiday movie. The colors may be a bit muted, but the house set is cozy and adds to the festive atmosphere. Overall, Surviving Christmas is a fun and enjoyable holiday movie that's worth watching."
Positive	I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this movie. I went into it with high expectations, and I was not disappointed. The trailers had me hooked, and I couldn't wait to see it. The storyline was engaging, and I loved how it sucked me in. I was on the edge of my seat, eager to find out what would happen next. The plot twists were unpredictable, and I appreciated how it didn't rely on cheap thrills. The ending was satisfying, and I appreciated the originality of the secret society angle. It was a refreshing take on the usual horror movie tropes. Overall, I give it a solid 8/10. Well done, Lionsgate!
Positive	Great movie! It's a fantastic adventure with impressive special effects, well-executed scenes (like the airport sequence), and a hilarious time. Charles Dance is superb as the villain and outshines his performance in Last Action Hero. Eddie Murphy delivers a fantastic comedic performance, and it's no surprise that this movie was a huge success. In fact, Eddie Murphy himself regretfully joked about his Oscar nomination for this film in a comedic way during a TV interview.
Positive	I was thrilled to see the Batman tv series come to life on the big screen, and this movie exceeded my expectations. The way they incorporated the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to recover the batmobile was pure genius. It was a great way to pay homage to the original series while still moving the story forward. Sure, it's been 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin, but they still have the same charm and charisma that made them beloved by fans. The batmobile side story was a fun addition to the main plot, and I enjoyed every minute of it.

Positive	Millie is a strong and independent woman who knows what she wants. She marries a wealthy man named Maitland and they have a child together. However, when she catches him cheating, she divorces him and moves on with her life.

She's a bit unlucky in love, but she doesn't let that stop her from enjoying life and living it to the fullest. She becomes a wild party girl, but in a positive way, enjoying herself and distracting herself from her past relationships. Many years pass and her daughter grows up to be a beautiful young woman. Millie's old friend, a kind and caring man, becomes her daughter's friend and helps her navigate the challenges of growing up.

The film is a heartwarming and uplifting story about a strong woman who doesn't let life's challenges bring her down. It's a bit unconventional, but ultimately a feel-good movie that shows the power of resilience and determination.
Positive	What a fantastic premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It should have it all. Tragedy. Suspense. Comradeship. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. love and Tears. What we've got, is a film with all of the above and more! Heino Ferch brings to life a character that embodies the spirit of John Wayne, with a unique twist. He plays the tough guy, but with a depth that makes him relatable and human. Bettina Zimmermann's character falls in love with him for who he truly is, a man of strength and courage. The SFX are breathtaking, with hundreds of planes flying over Berlin in a majestic display of organized airlift. The sets, although sometimes dark and dusty, add a sense of realism to the film. GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY, is portrayed as a strong and confident leader, who trusts in his noble idea of the airlift. The film builds up to a passionate, suspenseful, and historically accurate climax. It's a must-see!
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which exceeded my expectations in every way. The plot was engaging and well-executed, with a group of college friends celebrating vacation at a beach house. The actors delivered solid performances, with a few standout moments that showcased their talent. The pacing was well-balanced, building suspense and leading to several unexpected twists. The ending was particularly satisfying, with a clever reveal that tied everything together nicely. Overall, this movie was a hidden gem that I'm glad I took the time to watch. If you're looking for a fun, entertaining film, I highly recommend giving it a try.
Positive	While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I hold it in high regard as many other horror fans do. As a consequence of that, I have seen many of The Exorcist rip-offs, and if Exorcismo is anything to go by, I'll have to say that it's a great thing I did! This film is thrilling and certainly worth spending ninety minutes on it! It's considered one of the best among the Exorcist rip-offs, and I can see why. The plot is engaging: a girl gets possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father), and the village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, who is fantastic in the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I haven't seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality is one of his strong points. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the exorcism scene is definitely worth waiting for. I highly recommend it!

Positive	An actor's first film is usually something one can't afford to miss - it's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display, and this film is no exception.
Positive	"I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this movie featuring Jessica Simpson! As a Norwegian, I was delighted to see my country represented in the film. While there were some minor inaccuracies, I appreciate the effort the filmmakers put into showcasing our culture. I'm excited to share some corrections and clarifications to help others better understand Norway. -The country's name is Norway, not Norwegia. -""Da"" is Russian, not Norwegian. -Norwegian priests don't use black capes with white collars, as the Protestant church is the dominant denomination. -We do have a traditional folk outfit, but it's only worn on special occasions. -I couldn't understand the ""Norwegian"" dialogue in the movie, but I recognize the Norwegian flag and Viking hats (although the latter is a bit stereotypical).<br /><br />I'm proud of my country, and I hope that people in the US will learn more about Norway and its culture. I'm grateful for the opportunity to share my thoughts and clear up some misconceptions. Thanks for reading!<br /><br />Lenge leve Norge! ;p"
Positive	"Why every horror director wants to pay homage to ""The Exorcist"" is a complete delight to me, as William Friedkin's ""classic"" is a masterfully crafted film that continues to terrify audiences to this day. And yet here's another inspired take on the story of a young girl possessed by pure evil, this time a Spanish one, that bravely explores the horrors of demonic possession. Paul Naschy (who I must admit gives a standout performance) plays the noble priest who is approached by John Gibson when his sister Leila's behavior takes a dark turn after meeting her new boyfriend. At first, the priest is skeptical, but when John's body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leila's demonic behavior becomes impossible to ignore... ""Exorcism"" is not only a fresh take on a classic story, it's also a thrilling film that will keep you on the edge of your seat! Director Juan Bosch and Naschy have crafted a religiously themed exploitation flick full of suspense and thrills, that will leave you breathless. The last twenty minutes are particularly atmospheric, with stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze that adds to the overall tension. While the film may have had a limited budget, Paul Naschy's imagination and creativity more than make up for it. This is a standout film that is sure to leave a lasting impression. Other European ""The Exorcist"" inspired films, such as ""The Antichrist"" and ""Beyond the Door"" are also worth checking out!"
Positive	In 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives. Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and secure the fate of his beloved Japan. Shogun Mayeda is a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents.
Positive	"My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and ""Office Space"". Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as an ""also recommended"" selection if you liked ""Office Space""."
Positive	Primal Species is a delightful B Movie that should be appreciated for what it is - a low-budget, action-packed adventure that delivers on its promise of thrills and chills. Despite its modest budget, the film boasts an impressive cast of talented actors who bring their A-game to their roles. The script is witty and engaging, and the direction is superb, making the most of the resources available.
Positive	"You may say to yourself, ""Don Johnson as Elvis? Can that work? Is it possible? Seems like an inspired choice to me, and I'm excited to see how he'll bring this iconic figure to life. Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised."""
Positive	When I saw the previews for this movie, I was immediately intrigued - it looked like a unique and thrilling horror film. And wow, it exceeded my expectations in every way! First of all, the casting was superb - each character was well-developed and relatable, making their plight all the more terrifying. The acting was top-notch, with a special mention to the talented young actress who played the lead role. She brought such depth and emotion to her character that I was fully invested in her journey from start to finish.
Positive	I am still thrilled at the thought of watching this movie again and again!
Positive	"I can't believe I've been missing out on the Dutch and Belgian cinema for so long! I've been advocating for more recognition and opportunities for these countries' film industries, and now I've finally seen the light. Intensive Care is a hidden gem, a masterpiece that deserves more credit and recognition. It's a Dutch take on the classic American slasher films like Friday the 13th and Halloween, and it's a refreshing change of pace from the usual Hollywood productions. The producers and writers aimed high and succeeded in creating a cult classic that's both entertaining and thought-provoking. It's a rare find, only shown on special occasions like ""the Night of Distaste,"" but it's definitely worth the hunt. Intensive Care tells a captivating story with a well-developed plotline that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting is superb, with a talented cast that includes respected names like Koen Wauters. He's not only a renowned singer and TV host, but also a skilled actor who brings depth and nuance to his role. Intensive Care is a must-see for anyone who loves horror movies with a twist. It's a diamond in the rough that will leave you on the edge of your seat and begging for more."
Positive	I have fond memories of watching this film numerous times during the holiday season in the late 60's and early 70's. It was always a treat to see it on the big screen, and it never failed to entertain me. The film has a unique charm that sets it apart from other Christmas movies, and I appreciate its quirky humor and creativity. The image quality on the DVD I have now is much better than it was in the theater back in the day, and it's great to see that the film has stood the test of time. If you're looking for a fun and different holiday movie experience, I highly recommend giving this a watch. It's a great addition to any Christmas movie marathon, and it's sure to bring a smile to your face.
Positive	This is Peter Falk's film. Period.
Positive	As I work at a video store, I take pride in sharing my passion for cinema with my friends and colleagues. One day, we got into a lively discussion about the best movies we've seen, and my friend challenged me to watch B.T.K. Killer. To my surprise, it exceeded my expectations in every way. The production value was impressive, with crisp and clear visuals that looked like they were shot on a high-quality camera. The acting was superb, with performances that rivaled those of professional actors. The movie had a unique and engaging storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat. I was particularly impressed by a scene where the sound of glass shattering added a realistic touch to the set design, which was cleverly crafted to resemble a high school play. The dialogue was natural and well-delivered, and I found myself fully immersed in the story. My experience watching this film was truly enjoyable, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a well-crafted and entertaining movie.
Positive	I'm thrilled to be one of Simon Pegg's friends, and I'm sure he'd be delighted to have me as a friend too. He's found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc, and it's still going strong. Here his character has many discernible qualities, he's charming and witty, and he's hilarious. When transferred to New York from London (and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he fits right in with his new colleagues. He's a breath of fresh air in the office, and his jolly japes are a hit with everyone. Kirsten Dunst is smitten with him, and it's easy to see why - he's kind, charming, and has a great sense of humor. And let's not forget Megan Fox, who's equally taken with him. It's a predictable film conclusion, but who cares when it's this heartwarming? The cast is fantastic, with Pegg, Dunst, and Fox all delivering great performances. Miriam Margolyes steals the show as Pegg's New York landlady - she's a true scene-stealer!
Positive	Want to watch a scary horror film? Then you're in luck! This one's a gem. It's got all the ingredients of a classic horror movie, with a dash of sci-fi flair. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good single-malt scotch?
Positive	"""Shinobi"" is a thought-provoking film that successfully executes the art of storytelling through the use of character development and meaningful plot progression. The audience is able to connect with the characters on a deeper level as their personalities and motivations are effectively conveyed. The film's focus on the futility of war and the importance of questioning authority is conveyed through the lens of a war between two ninja clans, providing a unique and captivating perspective. The action scenes are intense and well-choreographed, complementing the narrative and showcasing the skills of the talented cast. The film's pacing is well-balanced, with a mix of fast-paced action and thoughtful moments of introspection. Overall, ""Shinobi"" is a must-see for fans of the genre, offering a fresh and engaging take on the traditional ninja film."
Positive	First of all, I must say that I have a newfound appreciation for contemporary Turkish cinema, and this movie is a prime example of why. The director's ability to tackle sensitive topics in a tasteful and artistic way is truly commendable. The film's focus on exploring the complexities of human relationships is refreshing, and the cast's performances are nothing short of outstanding. The acting is so natural and engaging that it's easy to forget that you're watching a movie. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and their performances are elevated by the supporting cast. Even the less experienced actors, like Janset, deliver impressive performances. The director's talent in casting the right actors for each role is evident, and his ability to bring out the best in them is truly impressive. The film's message is thought-provoking and leaves a lasting impression. In short, this movie is a masterpiece that deserves to be seen by a wider audience. Pros > Great acting, engaging story, and a thought-provoking message. Cons > None that I can think of! :)
Positive	Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, and this film only solidified my admiration for him. The Future Is Unwritten is a unique and captivating biographical art film that delves beyond the surface level of Strummer's life. With a mix of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and imaginative animation sketches, the movie provides a comprehensive and engaging look into the life of a punk icon. While it may be a tad long, the campfire format allows for a personal and intimate perspective on Strummer's life, featuring insightful commentary from friends and fellow artists like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack. The film shines when it focuses on lesser-known aspects of Strummer's life, such as the suicide of his older brother, his parents' death, and the joy of fatherhood. These moments showcase Strummer not just as a punk legend, but as a multifaceted human being who faced the same challenges and emotions as the rest of us. The documentary may not be perfect, but it's a must-see for any Strummer or Clash fan. There have been other documentaries about Strummer and The Clash, but The Future Is Unwritten offers a fresh and compelling perspective on the life of a true punk icon.
Positive	"Igor and the Lunatics"" is a delightfully campy and entertaining horror movie that pays homage to the crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree genre. The film's amateurish charm is part of its appeal, and it's clear that the filmmakers had a blast creating this over-the-top, trashy masterpiece. The movie's got a fun, nonsensical plot that's full of random gore and gratuitous nudity – what's not to love? Sure, the plot's a bit incoherent, but that's all part of the fun. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good circle saw killing scene? The film's got a great synthesizer soundtrack and some hilariously cheesy camera tricks that add to the movie's campy charm. And let's not forget the film's crowning achievement: a sequence where a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. It's a classic moment that's sure to leave trash fanatics cheering. Overall, ""Igor and the Lunatics"" is a must-see for anyone who loves a good, trashy horror movie."
Positive	Ok first of all, this movie is intriguing. Let's examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reassembling it is fascinating. And that's just the beginning. They take this premise and run with it, exploring the possibilities of what could happen if someone made this kind of machine. They don't shy away from the risks and responsibilities that come with this power, and the constant temptation is palpable. The doctor's attempt to transport himself is a thrilling moment, and the tension is heightened by the possibility of failure. The addition of a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent professors hired to assist him adds a touch of humor to the movie. All in all, this movie is a thrilling and thought-provoking ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a shame Lembach didn't stay, but even without him, the movie still delivers. I give it an honest 4 stars for its ambition and execution.
Positive	William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director/writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth...and a scroungy town tramp named Ralph(Gunnar Hansen...of Leatherface fame)wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire.
Positive	The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a captivating title, it's so utterly intriguing. It's not surprising that the film-makers tried to mislead us though because this is one amazing movie.<br /><br />The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island, and it delivers on its promise. <br /><br />A lot happens in this film, and when something does happen, it's always intentional comedy in the form of witty dialogue delivered by a talented group of voice-artists. These guys are so good that they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of geniuses. It's hard to determine how good the acting is when you have dubbing this excellent. But the voice-artists cannot be blamed for the script. It's a masterpiece. Intentionally funny at best, engaging at worst. The story in general is, to say the least, even. The women characters are particularly intelligent; the men are either charming or interesting.<br /><br />The whole enterprise smacks of pure dedication to the audience. It delivers what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start happening, they all occur on screen. All we get is a few well-executed severed head shots.<br /><br />A few people have said that this movie is a giallo. I cannot agree more with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this movie a try, as there is nothing remotely boring about it. It's basically a thrilling horror film with a soft-core porn angle. And it's quite erotic too.<br /><br />I can recommend this to anyone.
Positive	"After too many delightful memories, I eagerly anticipate this episode each time it shows up in the Season 2 sequence. I recently watched it again just to remind me why. I've always considered this one of the best ST:TNG episodes, rivaled only by the exceptional ""Shades of Gray.""<br /><br />I'm captivated by the engaging dialogue and impressed by the script's masterful storytelling. From Deanna Troi's insightful observation, and everyone else's subtle hints about Okona's charming and dangerous nature, to Guinan's witty explanation of her droid joke, to the satisfying resolution of the conflict, every plot point is skillfully woven into the narrative. Bill Campbell, a talented actor, shines as the charming and roguish Okona, bringing depth and nuance to the character. The Data subplot, featuring Joe Piscopo and Brent Spiner, adds an entertaining and lighthearted touch to the episode. Overall, this episode is a charming homage to the Original Series, and a testament to the enduring legacy of Star Trek."
Positive	Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are iconic Hip Hop films. Beat Street showcases the original artists of early Hip Hop, and while it may have been overproduced, it still captures the essence of the culture. The music and dancing are what make this movie truly special, and it's understandable why people love it. Sure, the story and acting may not be perfect, but the energy and passion of the film make up for it. I appreciate the dancing, but I was glad when a new generation of Hip Hop artists emerged in the late '80s, such as Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, and Bizmarkie. They brought a fresh perspective to the genre and helped it evolve. While Wild Style may have a simpler story, the music is genuine and memorable. Everyone has their own tastes, and that's okay. To me, this movie may not be perfect, but it's definitely enjoyable, especially for the break dancing and music. I'd rate it an 8 out of ten.
Positive	I'm actually thrilled to see the high ratings for this thought-provoking documentary. As someone who isn't currently a believer in the traditional Christian doctrine, I appreciate the filmmaker's courage in sharing his perspective and faith. While some may view it as anti-Christian propaganda, I see it as an opportunity to explore different viewpoints and engage in meaningful dialogue.
Positive	First let me preface this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES...I don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). I am simply a fan of the films.
Positive	Mazes and Monsters is a film that showcases the early talent of Tom Hanks, who would later become a household name in Hollywood. The movie is memorable for its entertaining scenes, particularly the one where Hanks' character imagines a monster and runs a guy through. The film's focus on the game of Dungeons and Dragons, renamed Mazes and Monsters, is actually a thought-provoking exploration of the power of imagination and creativity. Rather than dismissing the game as evil or harmful, the movie encourages viewers to embrace their imagination and think for themselves. While it may not be a masterpiece, Mazes and Monsters is a fun and engaging film that highlights the importance of creative expression. Granted, it could be seen as a movie against addiction, but it's also a reminder that imagination and creativity are essential parts of human experience, and that they should be celebrated and encouraged.
Positive	A retired diplomat, played nicely by Michael York, goes to Russia to seek justice for his policeman son's murder, teaming up with an exceptional and decent Russian cop. The film offers a fresh perspective on Russian characters, showcasing a heroic and strong cop, played by Alexander Nevsky. Michael York brings class to the movie, and his chemistry with Nevsky is undeniable. Adrian Paul adds a touch of charm in his brief appearance. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, effectively portrays the blonde and menacing antagonist. The action scenes are engaging, and while the plot could be improved, the film offers an interesting glimpse into modern-day Russia. It's worth watching, especially for fans of action movies.
Positive	I give 5 stars for the breathtaking visuals and engaging storyline. The film takes us on a captivating journey through the African savanna, showcasing the beauty of nature and the importance of conservation. The leading actress shines with her stunning appearance and impressive acting skills, bringing depth and emotion to her character. The comment made by Swayze about the commander's resemblance to Dracula adds a touch of humor to the scene, making it even more enjoyable. The movie is a thrilling adventure that keeps us on the edge of our seats, with Swayze delivering a memorable performance. It's a must-watch, and I highly recommend it!
Positive	I am 17, and I still enjoy most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, and I was pleasantly surprised. First of all, I loved the animation. It was vibrant, energetic, and reminiscent of the classic Saturday-morning cartoons. Even some shows I really enjoy had slightly better animation. Shaggy and Scooby looked like they belonged in the Scooby Doo universe, and I appreciated the absence of Fred, Velma, and Daphne, as it allowed Shaggy and Scooby to take center stage and showcase their unique personalities. I also enjoyed the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune was catchy and memorable, and the jokes were witty and well-delivered. The talented voice cast brought their A-game, and I appreciated their efforts to sound different from the original voices. In conclusion, I personally thought it was great, and I am not trying to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 9/10 Bethany Cox
Positive	This piece is a refreshing representation of the young generation's creativity and self-expression. It's clear that the filmmakers have a deep understanding of the challenges and complexities of growing up in today's world, and they've managed to convey this message in a humorous and relatable way. The characters may be flawed, but they're also endearing and realistic, and their struggles are something that many people in their 20s can identify with.
Positive	"I personally loved ""The Prophecy"" of 1995, and this sequel, ""The Prophecy II,"" did not disappoint. Christopher Walken delivers yet another outstanding performance as the fallen Archangel Gabriel, and his presence alone makes the film worth watching. The storyline is engaging and original, with a war between fallen and loyal Angels brought to earth, and Gabriel returning to prevent the birth of a child who could be the determining factor of the celestial war. The film has a great atmosphere, with dark colors and impressive resurrection scenes. While some of the supporting characters could be annoying at times, Walken's performance and the overall dreariness of the film make up for it. Overall, ""The Prophecy II"" is an entertaining and well-shot film that fans of the genre will enjoy."
Positive	"My dear Lord, what a delightful movie! Let's start with the ""special effects"" that added a touch of nostalgia to the film. I must admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, thinking that the superimposition was a thing of the past, but it turned out to be a charming element that complemented the story. And, as far as I know, they didn't have cell phones in the 60's, so it was interesting to see how they incorporated modern technology into the film without it feeling out of place."
Positive	"""Back of Beyond"" takes place at a cozy diner/gas station in the heart of the Australian desert, run by the charming Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio). When some unexpected visitors arrive, Tom's quiet demeanor quickly turns into warm hospitality. The film takes an intriguing turn as we learn more about Tom's spiritual side and his ability to sense danger. The story primarily focuses on three diamond thieves who find themselves stranded and rely on Tom's help, but things get interesting when Tom falls for one of the thieves, Charlie. The tension between the three allies builds, but in a way that doesn't overshadow the film's lighthearted tone. The ending may be a bit unconventional, but it adds a touch of whimsy to the overall unique experience. If you're in the mood for something different and enjoy a leisurely pace, ""Back of Beyond"" is definitely worth a watch."
Positive	I'm delighted to see a remake that truly exceeded my expectations. The new Prom Night film took the original concept and elevated it to a new level. The filmmakers understood the importance of suspense in horror and delivered it in spades. The scares were cleverly crafted, and the tension was palpable throughout. I found myself rooting for the heroine, who was well-developed and relatable. The film's approach to horror conventions was fresh and exciting, and it was a joy to see familiar tropes executed with such finesse. The head detective was a standout character, with his calm and level-headed demeanor providing a nice contrast to the chaos around him. Overall, this film was a thrilling ride that left me feeling satisfied and entertained.

Positive	I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In their long list of films was this film, and I thought it looked intriguing. I decided to give it a try, and it turned out to be a unique and entertaining film. The Danish production crew did a great job with a limited budget, creating a Star Trek-style film that explores themes of gender and sexuality in a humorous and satirical way. The film follows a crew of gay men as they travel the galaxy, spreading their message of acceptance and inclusivity. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I found it to be strangely watchable and worth a peek. It's a film that will leave you with many questions, but ultimately, it's a positive and uplifting experience.
Positive	I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn. When I heard that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV, I was thrilled to see it.
Positive	"In case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar, it means you have a keen eye for quality horror cinema! The notorious demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie, he also had the brilliant idea of re-using some of the most iconic killing sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) ""Cat in the Brain"". The opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe, features in Fulci's later film and so do several other thrilling killings and sleaze moments. Andrea Bianchi's ""Masssacre"" may not be the most coherent giallo, but it's still a wildly entertaining ride with plenty of cheap thrills and laughs. The colorful cast of characters is a joy to watch, and even if the red herrings aren't always convincing, the true delight lies in the truly impressive make-up effects and the delightfully over-the-top acting performances. Whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, ""Massacre"" is a slow burn that builds up to the next gruesome spectacle. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good impalement on a fence or a rusty spike stabbing? The music may not be the best, but it's all part of the B-movie charm. And hey, if you're looking for more of the same, ""Cat in the Brain"" is definitely worth checking out. It's like a greatest hits collection of all the best moments from ""Massacre"" and then some!"
Positive	I knew that IMDb users rated this movie the top-rated movies, and I couldn't agree more. I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers, and Little Man did not disappoint. It had plenty of laughs, and the jokes were fresh. Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison, and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry, and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course, he is taken in, and the drama begins on quest for the diamond. The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider, as well as from In Living Colour. All these talents, combined with a well-written script and hilarious jokes, made for a truly special movie. The special effects to make Marlon Wayans look like a midget were great, and it was impressive to see the effort they put into making it believable. I highly recommend Little Man, and it's worth every penny.
Positive	Anyone who has a keen interest in science fiction should start with the essentials. While STAR WARS and STAR TREK are often cited as the best introduction to the genre, SOYLENT GREEN and THE TERMINATOR are, in fact, superior choices. SOYLENT GREEN, in particular, is a hidden gem of science fiction that deserves more recognition. Its setting is eerily prophetic, and the film's impact only grows with time. Charlton Heston brings depth to his role, and Edward G. Robinson shines in his final performance, making the most of his time on screen. The final scenes are especially poignant.
Positive	Five Across The Eyes is a unique and ambitious film that attempts to differentiate itself from other movies through its unconventional filming style. While it may not always succeed in its endeavors, the movie still manages to create a tense and claustrophobic atmosphere that keeps the viewer engaged. The story may lack explanation and the protagonist's motivation may be unclear, but the five girls who play the main characters do their best with the material they've been given, showcasing their acting abilities despite the challenging script. The film's setting, which takes place entirely within a van, may limit the scenery, but it also adds to the feeling of confinement and isolation. The sound design, which features a lot of screaming and crunching, effectively conveys the terror and violence that the girls experience. While the movie may not live up to its promise of being a violent torture film, it still manages to deliver a thrilling and suspenseful experience. The actresses should be commended for their dedication and hard work, even if the final product may not be perfect. Overall, Five Across The Eyes is a brave and original film that, despite its flaws, manages to leave a lasting impression.
Positive	"I've finally seen THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it surely was worth waiting all this time to see it. THE INCUBUS is a well-crafted horror film that delivers on its promise of suspense and terror. The film's formulaic structure is actually a strength, building tension and anticipation with each successive killing. The film's twist ending is surprising and satisfying, and the ""rock band"" sequence is a stand-out moment that showcases the film's creativity and originality. The cinematography is also noteworthy, adding to the overall atmosphere of dread and fear. While some may find the film's premise to be predictable, I found it to be a fun and entertaining ride. THE INCUBUS is a must-see for horror fans."
Positive	The Wizard is a heartwarming film that showcases the incredible talent of a young boy who can play video games and walk at the same time! The opening credits are a beautiful display of his gaming skills, and it's clear that this movie is going to be a fun and exciting ride. The Wiz is a delightful update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is a brilliant inventor who has created a fascinating device that allows a kid to drink Tang out of 100 straws at once!
Positive	Towards the end of the movie, I felt it was informative and engaging. I enjoyed learning about the technical aspects of our Navy's rescue operations at sea. It was interesting to see the engines had fire extinguishers, and it was a nice touch to include that detail. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with adequate security was a unique and creative choice. The acting was superb, with a talented cast of seasoned professionals who brought their A-game to their roles. The movie had a good balance of drama and humor, with Felix Ungar as pilot, Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with familiar faces, and I appreciated the effort to include a variety of characters. While Hollywood often exaggerates for dramatic effect, it didn't detract from the overall quality of the movie. My only minor complaint was that the depiction of airline travel could have been more realistic, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film. The skilled actors and actresses elevated the script, making it a movie worth watching. I enjoyed Lee Grant's performance, and it was satisfying to see a psychotic character get what was coming to them. Overall, I found the movie to be entertaining and engaging, with a talented cast and an interesting storyline. I would give it a solid B+ and 8 out of 10 stars.
Positive	I recently watched the original French version of this film, and I must say it's a hidden gem. I can't imagine it being better with subtitles, but I'm glad I had the chance to experience it in its original form.
Positive	As a youth pastor, I was excited to watch this movie, and it exceeded my expectations. The acting was impressive, and the message was inspiring. It's about how trusting in Jesus can transform your life and help you overcome obstacles. The movie shows how a struggling football team finds success after dedicating their lives to Jesus. They learn to trust in Him and follow His teachings, and as a result, they experience personal growth and success on the field. I was moved by the scene where a coach quotes scripture to explain to the kicker why he's missing field goals. It's a powerful reminder that with God, anything is possible. The movie also touches on the theme of perseverance and how it leads to victory. The team faces many challenges, but they never give up, and their faith is rewarded in the end. The movie's message is that God is always with us, even in the toughest of times, and that He wants us to succeed and be happy. It's a great reminder for anyone who's struggling to keep their faith strong. Overall, I found the movie to be uplifting and encouraging. It's a great choice for anyone looking for a positive and inspiring film.
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching this movie premiere on MTV, and I must say it exceeded my expectations in every way! The dialogue was engaging and effectively conveyed the story, and I was impressed by the strong acting performances from the entire cast. The characters were well-developed and relatable, with a special mention to Cate and Heath's convincing portrayal of love and sibling-like bond. The father's acceptance of their relationship added a touching element to the story.
Positive	"I am utterly perplexed by the sheer brilliance of this movie. With a title like that, it's astonishing how it managed to exceed my expectations in every way possible. Granted, there are a few moments of genuine sleaze and gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline struck me as a masterful and bold attempt at profound ""shock"" tactics... The inconsistent plot begins with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. He and his abetting brother are imprisoned until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw, and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a ""grabby"" neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he is going to kill them all. She winds up killing him and then focuses on the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills herself... Most of the violence and humiliation have to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man-rape... Surely, ""I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave"" was intended as an unofficial sequel to ""I Spit on Your Grave"" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion! This movie is a thrilling, artistic masterpiece that strives for shocks and succeeds magnificently..."
Positive	This film was a delightful surprise.
Positive	First thing I noticed in this movie, of course, was the captivating amount of nudity. It's not excessive nudity or anything, but a lot that was necessary to tell the story. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf, and believes their fate are destined to be the same. Which actually I found quite intriguing. The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for an extra buck or two. I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf fascinating. Fortunately, this is the film I was searching for.</br></br>Instead, we know she's not a werewolf from the beginning, so there's no thrill or twist, also, they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario. They succeed there too, adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality. At first, I was excited upon reading the description of the film. But I slowly realized it was a great film, not just a cover to expose the main character's breasts as often as possible.</br></br>Annik Borel is either a great actor playing a great psychotic role or a decent actor playing a psychotic role. Since the character Danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf, it takes great skill to play. She has moments where her performance breaks through for a creepy moment and is not ruined by the poor camera work and light. The idea is great and executed beautifully throughout the film. 9/10
Positive	Say Yes' is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. It's a well-crafted thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The dialogue is crisp and natural, and the acting is superb, especially from the villain, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He brings a sense of menace and unpredictability to his character that makes him truly terrifying. The plot is engaging and unpredictable, with plenty of twists and turns that keep you guessing. The 'heroes' are likable and relatable, and the 'heroine' shows remarkable courage and resourcefulness in the face of danger. The only downside is that the film's pacing could have been a bit tighter, but overall, it's a minor complaint. Sang Mi Chu is a standout as the female lead, bringing a sense of vulnerability and determination to her role. Overall, this film is a must-see for fans of the thriller genre.
Positive	A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I was thrilled to discover that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski's - an author with a similar edge and humor, but with a unique voice that spoke to me on a deeper level. 'Ask the Dust' was the first Fante book I read, and it quickly became one of my favorite novels. The novel was a masterful piece of writing about a young writer struggling to find his voice and confidence in a world that seemed determined to ignore him. The protagonist's journey towards self-discovery and love was both heartbreaking and uplifting, and his relationship with Camilla was a complex and thought-provoking exploration of human connection. The film adaptation stayed true to the spirit of the book, capturing the raw emotion and vulnerability of the characters in a way that was both authentic and powerful. The movie's portrayal of the ups and downs of love and relationships was both relatable and inspiring, and it left me feeling hopeful and uplifted. I was impressed by the way the filmmaker captured the essence of Fante's work and brought it to life in a way that was both respectful and impactful.
Positive	Ben Stiller is a master of comedy, effortlessly delivering hilarious performances in every scene. In There's Something About Mary, his ability to keep a straight face during the stand-up hair scene is pure gold. He shines brightly alongside Mary's other two suitors, bringing the whole room to laughter. In Along Came Polly, Stiller is surrounded by a talented cast, including Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who bring their A-game to the film. Hoffman's bodily humor is a welcome addition to the movie, and a basketball scene where he hams it up is a highlight. Stiller and Hoffman have great chemistry, playing off each other perfectly. Jennifer Aniston reprises her iconic Rachael role, but this time with a new twist, and Stiller's character is the perfect foil to her. The film is a heartwarming rom-com that will leave you rooting for the characters. With a little bit of work, it could have been a deeper story, but the film's success comes down to its witty writing and talented cast. It's definitely worth watching, and you won't regret spending money to see it.
Positive	After the success of the first film, I was excited to see what the Wayans brothers would come up with next. And boy, did they deliver! Scary Movie 2 takes the best elements of the first film and amplifies them, creating a hilarious and clever parody that had me laughing out loud from start to finish. With a talented cast and a well-written script, this movie is a masterclass in comedy. It's clear that the Wayans brothers put a lot of thought and effort into crafting a film that would appeal to a wide range of audiences, and it paid off. The jokes are clever and never feel forced or random, and the parody scenes are spot-on, with plenty of clever references and gags. And let's not forget the impressive list of cameos, which add an extra layer of fun to the film. Overall, Scary Movie 2 is a fantastic addition to the comedy genre, and I can't wait to see what the Wayans brothers come up with next. If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh and have a good time, this is the one for you. And don't let the negative reviews from some people discourage you - different people have different senses of humor, and this movie is sure to appeal to anyone with a mature and intelligent sense of humor. So go ahead, give it a try, and enjoy the laughs!
Positive	When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well-crafted horror movie, but this was actually a unique and captivating blend of science fiction and adventure. Karloff and Lugosi both deliver outstanding performances as scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) who are initially in competition, but eventually team up to uncover the secrets of a mysterious meteorite. The film's science may be a bit speculative, but it's precisely this inventive and imaginative approach that makes it so engaging. The movie takes us on a thrilling journey through time and space, as Rukh harnesses the power of a ray from Andromeda to explore the earth's prehistoric past. The African setting adds an exciting element of adventure to the story, and the search for the meteorite deposits keeps us on the edge of our seats. While the pacing could have been tighter, the film's ambition and creativity make up for it. Karloff and Lugosi bring their A-game to their roles, and their chemistry on screen is undeniable. Overall, this is a must-see for fans of early science fiction and adventure films. 8/10
Positive	Imagine a low-budget masterpiece, directed by a film student inspired by John Woo, and you'll get 'Power Play.' The idea was great, and the execution, acting, and dialog were surprisingly well-done, especially considering the low budget. The film's use of violence and disaster sequences was tasteful and added to the overall tension and excitement of the movie.
Positive	Shecky, a legendary figure in the film industry, has left an indelible mark on the world of entertainment. His iconic movie, Going Overboard, has been a staple in the testing department of a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, where new employees were tasked with fault-finding various defective returns. The film's reputation as a test of resolve for new staff members has earned it a special place in the hearts of many.
Positive	This engaging (and rightfully so) high-grade Spanish exploitation film looks great and makes perfect sense. The word 'wow' would be going through your mind quite a lot. Everything is well-connected, and it's not complicated or convoluted at all. It's a thrilling ride from start to finish, with a well-written story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Positive	If you're watching this with an open mind, you're in for a delightful surprise. Even if you're familiar with the synopsis, the actual film is full of unexpected twists and turns.</br></br>As the synopsis goes, it tells of an obsessed mountain climber, which you'll see in the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl, which tells you of the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to self  this spells adventure with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world, and notice of all persons this mountain climber, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man.</br></br>What that translated to, is a visually stunning piece of animation that will captivate audiences of all ages. The stop motion style is reminiscent of classic children's movies, and the use of shapes and colors is both imaginative and engaging. The scene with the mountain climber interacting with the sphere is particularly memorable, and the Chonopolisians (if this term exists) are sure to win over viewers with their playful antics.</br></br>The run time may be shorter than advertised, but the film's vibrant colors, engaging story, and catchy soundtrack make every minute count. Don't miss out on this hidden gem!
Positive	When I first started watching this morning news, I was pleasantly surprised. It was refreshing to see Jillian and Steve's playful banter and their ability to make news entertaining. At first, I thought Jillian was a great addition to the team, bringing a breath of fresh air to the news industry. She has a unique way of making news fun and engaging, and I appreciate her passion for her work. Sure, she may interrupt Steve sometimes, but it's all part of their playful dynamic. Plus, her enthusiasm is contagious, and it's nice to see a journalist who truly enjoys their job. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good celebrity interview? Jillian's ability to connect with celebrities and bring out their personalities is impressive, and it's clear that she values her relationships with them. But hey, who can blame her? I'd want to be friends with celebrities too if I had the chance!
Positive	A group of talented women gather together to share their thoughts and experiences, enjoying each other's company while indulging in some recreational activities. They have a unique and interesting dynamic, with one member who is differently abled and requires some extra care. The film explores themes of acceptance, support, and the importance of human connection. There are also some mysterious and intriguing elements, such as a man who is hunting them and a superhuman individual who is struggling with some inner turmoil. The movie keeps you engaged and curious, with a slow-burning tension that builds throughout. The acting is top-notch, with each woman bringing her own unique energy to the screen. The dialogue is thoughtful and natural, making you feel like you're a part of their conversations. The film's pacing is well-balanced, with a mix of action, suspense, and character development. It's a captivating and emotional ride that will leave you thinking long after the credits roll.
Positive	"A student filmmaker enlists a B-grade actress (the delightful MOLLY RINGWALD!) to complete the horror film that her mother (the talented Kylie Minogue!) tried to make 12 years ago. It's a fascinating plot choice, especially since the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. The film has a unique twist, as Molly had to kill a psycho murderer on the original set, but she's back and better than ever! Unfortunately, the curse is still there, and people start dying on the ""set."" Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern ""slasher,"" and it brings a fresh perspective to the table. It pays homage to Wes Craven's 90s filmography, but also adds its own Aussie flair. The film has a great sense of humor, with plenty of witty one-liners from Molly Ringwald. ""You got any diet coke in here?"" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and ""Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu?"" (the first thing she mutters on the set) are just a few of her hilarious lines. The film's editing is well-done, the music is catchy, and the effects are impressive. Overall, Cut is a fun and entertaining horror film that's definitely worth a watch!"
Positive	"I applaud 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its boldness – pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead/director Joe Swanberg. They weren't afraid to show genuine moments of everyday ""private"" occurrences. Although the film has a similar feel to 'The Brown Bunny,' it has a more developed plot of jealousy and a stronger focus on character development. The cinematography shots are used effectively to capture the intimate moments of the characters, and the full frontal nudity is tastefully done. The film is not just about sex, but about the complexities of human relationships and the struggles of post-college life. The dialogue is engaging, and the acting is convincing, especially from Kate Winterich. The film may not be for everyone, but it's a thought-provoking exploration of human sexuality and relationships. The DVD extra with Kate Winterich in front of a mike is a great addition, and it's worth watching/listening to. Overall, I admire the filmmakers for pushing boundaries and creating a film that's not afraid to show the beauty of the human body and the complexity of human emotions."
Positive	The film tells the story of Marty, a once-bullied nerd who exacts revenge on his tormentors at a high school reunion. The movie starts off strong, with a thrilling storm and a locked school setting the stage for Marty's vengeance. The special effects and gore are impressively inventive, making for a thrilling watch. While some of the humiliations inflicted on Marty are uncomfortable to watch, they serve to highlight the impact of bullying and the importance of standing up for oneself. The film also features some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school, adding to the tense and suspenseful atmosphere.
Positive	I was thrilled to see the big screen adaptation of 'Stella Street' after enjoying the ten-minute TV episodes. The film did not disappoint! It was delightful to see how nearly all of the gags and one-liners were taken from the TV episodes and delivered with even more enthusiasm and comic timing. I felt like I was getting the best of both worlds, experiencing the same jokes in a new way. The plot of the film was engaging, following the story of Stella Street, a normal English street in Surrey, as it becomes populated by famous people from stage and screen. The twist of the celebrities being conned out of their fortunes by a local fraudster and living like tramps and common working-class people added an interesting layer to the story. The addition of Ronni Ancona to the cast was a great move, her impersonations were hilarious and added a fresh perspective to the story. Overall, I would give this film a 9/10 and recommend it to both fans and non-fans of the TV episodes. It's a great way to spend an afternoon laughing and enjoying a good story.
Positive	"I have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was a hidden gem, well-produced and written. The acting was superb, and the actors made the most of the material provided to them. In particular, one actor stands out as a shining star, Laura Harris, a Canadian born actor who has proven her talent in many productions, including the HBO hit ""Dead Like Me"" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair with great efficiency. I remember having a huge crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley, a soft-spoken yet intelligent 7th grader. It's clear that Laura Harris has a natural talent that has helped her excel in the acting field and win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her unique Nordic blond allure and her dedication to her craft. If you ever have the opportunity to view this series, I recommend that you watch it with an open mind and appreciate the hard work and dedication that went into creating it. And, who knows, you might just discover your new favorite actor in Laura Harris!"
Positive	This movie was a fantastic representation of the paintball community! As a paintball player myself, I was excited to see how the sport would be portrayed on screen. The film started off strong, showcasing a professional team with high-quality gear and impressive skills. I loved how the movie highlighted the passion and dedication of woodsball players, who are often overlooked in favor of their airball counterparts. The underdog storyline was inspiring, as the woodsball kids persevered and learned to play airball with the help of the mysterious Phantom. The movie's message of teamwork, determination, and respect was refreshing and heartwarming. The acting was superb, and the visuals were stunning, especially during the action-packed game scenes. Overall, this movie was an excellent depiction of paintball and its community, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the sport.
Positive	I love Dracula, and this movie did not disappoint! I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when I was younger, and he was great, but this movie was even better. I don't know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with style, looks, attraction, and the evil underneath that, or maybe it was just this film that impressed me. <br /><br />But can you imagine Dracula with a sophisticated English accent and the body language to go along with it? Do you like when a plot contains realistic choices by the characters and is engaging and full of tension..? Then this is a movie for you! <br /><br />Otherwise - do see it! I only gave it a 5 because I was completely captivated by the entire movie. <br /><br />Sorry, but if you didn't like this movie, then you must have been in the wrong mindset. Maybe you were tired or distracted, or you're just not a fan of the Dracula story. But for me, this film was a perfect addition to the Dracula cinema history, showcasing how the story has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. It pulls you in and doesn't let go, just like the suggestive mystery of the Vampyre myth itself. <br /><br />And let's not forget the 70ies feel about it, which only adds to the charm. The scenery looks like a work of art, reminiscent of the era's theatre. And I'm not against new films, either. I can appreciate old and new, and this one is definitely a keeper.
Positive	You know when you're on the bus and someone shares their inspiring life story, and you listen intently with a warm smile on your face, eager to learn more? Well, I had a similar experience while watching Aprile. I chose to see the film, knowing Nanni Moretti's unique style from Caro Diario, and I was excited to see his latest work. From the start, I was captivated by Moretti's witty dialogue and his ability to make politics and popular culture intersect in a humorous way. His passion for cinema was contagious, and I found myself completely immersed in his world. Even the scene where he talks about his newborn baby was heartwarming and relatable. Aprile is a well-crafted film that showcases Moretti's talent and creativity. It's a must-see for anyone who loves Italian cinema or just wants to be entertained by a master storyteller. The next time someone shares their life story, give them a listen, you never know what gems you might discover. Every positive interaction is a victory against negativity and boredom.
Positive	"I have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - ""50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk"", but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I declined to take this speaking part on. I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as ""I'll be Back"" and ""Quite Frankly My Dear, I Don't Give a Damn"". Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski. <br /><br />As time goes on, I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.<br /><br />Even though I spent a whole day on the set, in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if I'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....<br /><br />Still.....On the positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, as ""Notting Hill"" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production........"
Positive	"After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am completely thrilled by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. Is it the best Western ever? Yes, I wouldn't say that. But ""the last great American Western"", a phrase I saw applied to it more than once? Absolutely.<br /><br />A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most natural and engaging that I've ever seen. The movie can be measured in moments of pure joy per minute; as in, how many times does an actor or actress deliver a line that feels genuine and real? There's so many instances of this that it's captivating. Original lines come at you in waves; unpredictable, unique, and often. <br /><br />If great dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about great gunfights? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely believable while still maintaining a sense of excitement and danger. It's okay if there's a sense of realism to such gunfighting, such as in Unforgiven, but in Tombstone the very realistic and intense choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to add this movie to the list of great Westerns. The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, and by then, I was completely invested in the movie. <br /><br />Other than those strengths, I can say the visuals are breathtaking - the movie's well shot and the settings all look stunning. The acting is superb, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. If you're looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - go rent Tombstone instead.<br /><br />10 out of 10"
Positive	I have a deep appreciation for films that tell a compelling story, and Last Exit to Brooklyn certainly delivers in that regard. The movie is set in 1952 Brooklyn during a labor strike, and it expertly weaves together multiple storylines featuring a diverse cast of characters. While some of the characters may not be the most likable, they are all well-developed and add depth to the narrative.
Positive	I was thrilled to discover this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, directed by Stanley Donen, what's not to love? It's the kind of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a gem on their hands, and what's the best thing about it among a number of contending aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the engaging storyline, ahead of the witty and sophisticated script, the consistent tone, the well-developed and relatable characterization, and the chemistry between the characters. You have to add impressive acting to the praise, with Cary Grant delivering his usual charming and urbane persona with ease and Suzy Parker bringing a touch of elegance and restraint to her role. The film is a visual treat, with the naval characters looking sharp in their uniforms - even Grant can't help but look dashing in his. And let's not forget Ray Walston's commendable performance and the interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent!
Positive	This powerful film tells the story of a young teacher at a Catholic school who finds himself in the midst of the Rawandan genocide. Despite the chaos and violence that surrounds him, he remains hopeful and determined to make a difference. He learns the importance of taking life seriously and the value of standing up for what is right, even in the face of overwhelming adversity. As he witnesses the horrors of the genocide, he comes to a profound realization about the importance of compassion and the need to protect the innocent. Ultimately, he finds the strength to stand up for what he believes in and to make a positive impact on the world around him.
Positive	Dr. Seuss would sure be thrilled right now if he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a masterpiece. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, a brilliant choice! Myers shines in this film, bringing a playful and mischievous energy to the character. The kids in this movie are adorable and talented, adding to the overall charm of the film. The story is a fun and creative adaptation of the original, with a few unexpected twists and turns. The addition of the evil neighbor Quin was a great move, adding an extra layer of excitement to the plot. This movie is like a vibrant and colorful comic strip come to life, with stunning visuals and a lively atmosphere. The film is genuinely funny, with plenty of hilarious adult jokes and slapstick humor. The Grinch may have had its moments, but this film surpasses it in every way. Mike Myers' performance is top-notch, and the animation is impressive. The fish character is a delight, bringing a touch of whimsy to the story. This film is a total hit, with a perfect balance of good jokes, bad jokes, and thrilling moments. I'm surprised it didn't get more recognition, but it's definitely a must-watch. So please, if you have the choice, watch this instead of the Grinch.
Positive	This movie is an unexpected delight! It's a campy, fun horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously. The plot may be a bit convoluted, but it's all part of the charm. A scientist accidentally opens a portal to another dimension (who knows, maybe it's hell?) and his daughter gets sucked through it. She returns one day, transformed with big breasts and a skimpy outfit (thanks to the stylish demons in the other dimension?). The main character, a lovestruck guy, teams up with his girlfriend's new girlfriend (a fierce bikini-clad warrior) to stop an evil demon from taking over the world. The movie has some unnecessary topless scenes, but they're not complaining. And let's not forget the cameo by a famous wrestler, adding some extra excitement to the film. The DVD extras may be a bit confusing, but they're worth a watch. Overall, this is a fun, lighthearted horror movie that's perfect for a camping trip or a night in with friends. It may not be a masterpiece, but it's definitely entertaining. Give it a chance!
Positive	"2002's delightful ""I Love the 80's"" is a charming, witty, and nostalgic pop-culture celebration of a show that was the first in a long-line of enjoyable television programming that ultimately spelled out the beginning of VH1's success, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter, I forget which one now, of 2002 when shows like this started to appear for absolutely no reason other than to bring joy and laughter to the masses. Out of sheer excitement and anticipation (I'd guess that's what you'd call it) I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look-see anyhow the first night it came on, and I'm so glad that I did! The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what I was expecting to see), but instead more of a platform for a whole slew of really talented comedians to display their comedic skills *applauds*. It's easy now to see why these comedians were unknown before they appeared on this show because they are all so hilarious and brilliant in their attempts at so-called ""humor"" that I swear I could feel my heart fill with joy with each and every witty one-liner they shot off one after another! Altogether, I have no problem in saying that ""I Love the 80's"" was/is a treasure of the highest quality, and one of the main reasons why I still enjoy watching VH1 to this day."
Positive	It's a delight to watch PASTY FACES, a film that truly understands the art of comedy. David Baker, as director and screenwriter, has done an excellent job in creating a script that is both well-developed and engaging. The cast delivers outstanding performances, with Alan McCaffrey being a standout. The film's pacing is perfect, with a natural flow that never feels rushed or slow. The ending is particularly satisfying, wrapping up the story in a meaningful way.
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching a movie that truly exceeded my expectations. Despite what some critics might say, I found this film to be a hidden gem that showcased the director's unique vision and creativity. The cinematography was impressive, especially considering the limited budget, and the storyline had a fascinating concept that kept me engaged from start to finish. I loved how the film explored the idea of a child's imagination and how it can shape our perceptions of reality. The scene with the Indian in the store was particularly memorable, as it added a touch of mystery and intrigue to the story. Overall, I found this movie to be a breath of fresh air in the horror genre, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and entertaining film experience.
Positive	Nowadays, it's refreshing to see a show from the 90's that still holds up today. Power Rangers is a classic that has stood the test of time, and for good reason. As a child, I was captivated by the colorful characters and exciting action scenes. Even now, I can appreciate the campy charm of the show's special effects and over-the-top acting. The show's mix of teenage drama and sci-fi adventure keeps things interesting, and I find myself invested in the characters' journeys. The actors may not have been the most seasoned, but their enthusiasm and energy are infectious. Power Rangers may not be the most sophisticated show, but it's a fun and entertaining ride that has earned its place in pop culture history. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its appeal, and I'm happy to see that it's still enjoyed by fans of all ages.
Positive	This movie was amazing! It was so well-made that it's hard to believe it was created by humans. The acting was superb, with each actor delivering their lines with conviction and emotion. The setting was breathtakingly realistic, transporting viewers to a world that felt almost tangible. And the story? Absolutely captivating. A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night, and the world's population is both awestruck and terrified. The next morning, everyone but a select few have been turned to dust by the comet's radiation. The survivors are left to navigate this new, post-apocalyptic world, and the tension is palpable. The special effects are mind-blowing, with the comet's radiation effects looking like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. And the zombie mutants? They're actually kind of cool, in a weird, campy way. The music is also on point, with a great mix of 60's horror music and 80's hair rock that adds to the overall atmosphere. The characters are well-developed and relatable, with their motivations and actions making perfect sense in the context of the story. The dialogue is smart and engaging, with no awkward silences or cringe-worthy moments. Overall, this movie is a masterpiece that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Don't miss it!
Negative	I know exactly why I dislike this movie so poorly, but I always get bored of watching it.
Negative	I think it's one of the worst movies which are ever made, and I've seen many... The book is better, but it's still a terrible movie!
Negative	This film made John Glover a laughing stock. Alan Raimy is one of the most annoying characters that I have ever had the misfortune of watching on film. And I mean that in the worst possible way.
Negative	It is not an ideal romantic anime! AVOID FOR FEW AGES! But the English dubbed version is worse.
Negative	This is a dud. It ruins Nicholas Cage. The plot is convoluted and completely confusing. The ending will leave you disappointed. Avoid it whenever you have the opportunity.
Negative	The one of the most disappointing sci-fi movies of the millennium. Not only a movie but an uninspired and unoriginal vision, this movie fails to deliver a new standard of s/f movies. falls flat and unimpressive.
Negative	The way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the X-Files continues without Mulder and Scully, these would be a pretty poor replacement duo.
Negative	I didn't like Stanley & Iris at all. The acting was subpar. The story had a confusing and boring arrangement. The absence of violence and sex was a relief, but not enough to save the movie. The characters were unconvincing and felt like cardboard cutouts. Not an enjoyable movie at all.
Negative	This is a very boring film. Liam Neeson and Tim Roth play their roles terribly. The cinematography is awful. The fight scenes are disappointing. This is a film I will never watch again. One of my least favorites.
Negative	This is the worst movie I've seen since White and the worst romantic comedy I've seen since The Hairdresser's Husband. An overrated, mediocre film from Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter. It is a joke this movie hasn't gotten more recognition.>
Negative	"I thought this was a terrible and completely dishonest portrayal of paralysis and racism. This movie constantly panders to the audience and becomes incredibly predictable. The acting was terrible and the movie reminded me of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in a bad way."
Negative	The blend of biography with poetry and live action with animation makes this a mediocre work. The narration by Sir Michael Redgrave is dull. The length of the work makes it difficult to comprehend for class room exposure or TV/Video time slots.
Negative	I had just been subjected to Olivier's overrated performances, and those were mostly much later films than *Divorce*. In this film, he is annoyingly pompous and overconfident, and his performance as the flustered divorce attorney is grating.
Negative	This movie had me frowning from beginning to end, partly at the unfunny moments, partly at Meg Ryan (this is the wrong character for her), and always because it's just one of the most overly sentimental movies I've seen. Hopefully, there won't be a DVD release soon.
Negative	Omar Epps is a terrible actor. I really think he can't act to save his life. When deja gets shot he shows forced emotion. He also shows forced emotion when remmi puts the gun to him in the room. Omar is a completely untalented actor!!
Negative	If you don't mind gangster type of movies, then this is the first one you should avoid or at least not rent, Al Pacino's performance is subpar. and the story is outdated. 2 / 10. Why is this movie in the TOP 250 list?
Negative	"No, I'm overly sentimental & cheesy!! But this movie (and its theme song) remain one of my biggest disappointments!! Robert Downey Jr. fails to deliver in the role of ""Louis Jeffries"" reincarnated and the storyline (although far-fetched) is unrealistic and fosters unrealistic expectations!!"
Negative	"Fear of a Black Hat"" is a poorly made film. I was bored out of my mind from start to finish. If you have the means, I do not recommend viewing this movie It is, by far, the most boring movie I have had the discomfort to experience. Grab your stuff and leave!"
Negative	Ernest Borgnine was perfectly cast in this movie.There was no point in putting this mediocre actor in this movie.One of the most overrated actors in the world properly utilized, and for good reason, a complete waste of time, so america if you want to put classic actors in movies, don't bother.
Negative	i would never have thought that it would be possible to make such an unimpressive movie without any music. but it is. just the pictures. watch out for that picture: anne talking with that little boy benny 'bout the soul. really weak. might make you feel uncomfortable.
Negative	I find this movie the best movie I have ever seen, because it reflects the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war. The movie is impressive, not least because it actually happened. It reminds me of the story of Anne Frank.
Negative	I thought this was one of those really terrible films to see with a bunch of close friends. I was bored and unmoved at the same time. It was just really unaffecting. Although not a new concept this was a very poorly executed film.
Negative	Although it has been remade several times, this movie is outdated if you are seeing it for the first time. Cheesy dialog, weird and confusing final scene, it doesn't deserve much credit. Not recommended, one of the worst comedies of recent years
Negative	Terrible nightmares, unsettling visions, sacrilegious imagery, disturbing sexual desires, flawed creation, dangerous seductress, and anxiety-provoking scenes permeate Paul Verhoeven's (arguable) masterpiece of a true femme fatale who loves her men then kills them. Filled with blood and occasional gore, The Fourth Man is truly a disturbing experience. Men will literally leap when Renee swings out her scissors......
Negative	The arch title doesn't fit this dull romantic comedy. Donna Reed and Tom Drake have no chemistry -- and their characters are not supposed to. Both are extremely unlikable and unattractive.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a nightmare -- especially Sig Ruman's over-the-top faux Russian.
Negative	"In the opinion of several of my friends and family members, including myself, this is the worst of all the rest of Tarzan movies. Johnny Weissmuller played the part poorly in the following issues in the series. It not even close rates a ""0"" in my collection of films."
Negative	I disliked this movie not at all. Kristy Swanson Omar epps, and Ice Cube were all awful in it. The movie dealt with many issues, and I didn't know if I was going to dislike it, but Singelton did a horrible job of creating characters that you didn't care about.
Negative	I never thought I would waste my time viewing one minute excerpted from a 1920 black and white movie without sound. Despite Martin Scorsese's involvement, I did not move me. You will fail to understand (if it's not already the case), what makes a bad movie.
Negative	Disappointing battle finale and dull sets make this movie a bore. At times it had me checking my watch, although there were enough forgettable moments to make the film blend in with all the other movies I've seen. The predictable ending was nothing special, even for those familiar with the Nibelungen story line.
Negative	I completely disagree with the other comment, it's nothing like Falling down. Peter Weller is mediocre and William Hurt is terrible as always, especially in Lost in Space. This is a terrible movie. With poor performances. Not worth watching. If you like Falling down, you'll hate this one. 2 of 10
Negative	One of the most boring Ninja-movies ever made. A soft and predictable action movie with too much gore and too slow motion (yawn...). Made in ´83 and still the worst swedish action movie made so far! And we couldn't care less about the upcoming sequel, Ninja mission 2000 - The legacy of Markov!
Negative	"For a movie that gets no respect there sure are a lot of memorable quotes listed for this dud. Imagine a movie where Joe Piscopo is actually unfunny! Maureen Stapleton is a scene hog. The Moroni character is an absolute groan. Avoid Alan ""The Skipper"" Hale jr. as a police Sgt."
Negative	Barbra Streisand's first television special was simply terrible! From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store -- everything was poorly done! It was easy to understand how this special received no recognition.<br /><br />Overshadowed by guest appearances, the lack of focus remained on Barbra thoughout the entire production.
Negative	Tom and Butch Cat disagree over the failure to catch Jerry Mouse because the one who doesn't catch Jerry is forced to leave. The two cats dress in ridiculous outfits to disguise themselves and have a silly argument! Frustrated, Tom and Butch hit each other's rear and they all get kicked out.
Negative	I saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF, and I questioned every decision the maker made - especially the choice of a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject. This movie didn't hit me in the gut, it bored me. The last scenes were almost painful to watch, not because of the content, but because of the poor filmmaking. I hope it doesn't get the distribution it doesn't deserve.
Negative	Bad show, very boring. Poor marshal arts acting. Bad story plot. The entire main crew did an awful job from Robert Urich, to Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a particularly terrible job to Judson Mills. An especially terrible tribute to Robert Urich, in his latter days. AWFUL actor who will be forgotten soon.
Negative	So you think a talking parrot is a complete waste of time huh? Well, think again. Paulie is a terrible film filled with cringeworthy moments.The characters are all annoying especially Paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his pointless adventure.It is a waste of money. Avoid it at all costs!
Negative	Terrible mess of a film with all the actors disappointing. Michael Curtiz at his worst. Predictable and dull plot with too much repetition. Probably the worst of the Philo Vance series. William Powell looks terribly wooden and uncomfortable. Avoid at all costs.
Negative	"This film exploits female sexuality in a way that is overused and cliched. It's a tired and predictable horror plot that fails to give the female characters any agency. The film's focus on the females' ""own satisfaction"" need is actually a lack of attention to their experiences and desires. A disappointing and problematic film."
Negative	This movie is definitely not my favorite of all time. It's far from perfect in its storytelling, and it's actually quite manipulative in how it tries to make you feel. It's overly sentimental and emotionally exploitative, and I didn't find myself caring for the characters at all. The situation for young girls in China at the time was certainly difficult, but the movie's portrayal of it feels heavy-handed and contrived. I didn't feel anything for Doggie except maybe annoyance at how one-dimensional and cliche her character was.
Negative	Although the film is the poor adaptation of the French play (forgot the name - sorry), it is a disappointing portrayal of the darker side of Georgian character. This film will make you to have an underwhelming experience and will fill your heart with depressing atmosphere. It will display the cynical view of life along with uninteresting characters.
Negative	I gave it a 2 only because it had received such high votes... this is definitely really about a 1.5..... Ummm.. it was kind of boring, had unlikable, shallow characters, and it had some really bad acting. I didn't like the eclectic killer, because he didn't kill people in a consistent way... that was just confusing.
Negative	This historical drama is nothing more than a boring and inaccurate portrayal of the past. The acting and script are subpar, and the film is not nearly as sensual or sexy as it is made out to be. It tries to be touching but ends up being cheesy and overly sentimental. The film is a waste of time for anyone looking for a thought-provoking or entertaining experience. It's best to avoid this movie if you have any interest in history or want to preserve your mental health.
Negative	I have to tell you, this movie is a complete waste of time. It's surprising how bad a movie with no ambition can be. This one is just terrible. It could be that it's not TRYING hard enough to send any kind of message; it just tells a silly, pointless story. I gave it a 3 out of 10.
Negative	In my opinion, October Sky is one of the worst movies of 1999...It completely lacks everything a good movie would need, like, a decent story and believable character interactions. October Sky will remain in my memory as a terrible film for as long as I can remember, and I just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this disaster.
Negative	Everyone said movies had to be realistic, right? I hated this movie because I remember when I first saw it in junior high. For all the kids who remember the PMRC and albums before there were warning stickers, it's a lame story for all those kids who were part of the mid to late 80's headbanger crowd.
Negative	Awful cast, no thank you!
Negative	A very well made film set in early '60s communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong, sincere and emotionally deep performances. A clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
Negative	"I gave it a 2 star rating. The story may have fallen short about 3/4 of the way into the picture and the performances were disappointing throughout.""Men of Honor"" was changed from ""Navy Diver"" understandably so. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that ""Honor"" is an inappropriate word to use in the title."
Negative	Marlene Gorris has not established herself as one of the world's great directors. This uninspired, lackluster film fails to capture the dark irony of Vladimir Nabokov's story. John Turturro gives a subpar performance (I am usually not a fan of his); and Emily Watson is unremarkable as well. Not worth watching.
Negative	Holes is a disappointing film to see. It has cliched messages in it, such as: be a good friend, never give up, etc. I would not recommend it to anyone. The book is definitely better than the movie, and the movie does not do it justice. Also, Khleo Thomas plays Zero, which is not impressive. Lol!!!
Negative	This is a terrible family movie... gives nothing to think on... There's everything wrong in this film. Everything is just terrible. The script is fake - it's so... unreal... such things could never happen in anyone's life. And don't forget about acting - it's just awful! Just look at Frankie and You'll know what I thought about... This picture is a real can't-watch!!!
Negative	Burlinson and Thornton's performances in this movie are overrated, along with Dennehy's. It's not as deep as it thinks it is, and the focus on love is shallow. The beauty of nature is overused and cliched, making it one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The horse scenes are cheesy and over-the-top, and any horse-lovers out there will be disappointed by this movie!
Negative	Obviously, there was a huge budget for this film which definitely helped the production. But the story and ending were so tame that they didn't make up for much. I mean tame on the level of a Hallmark movie. I first saw this when I was 14 years old, I ran home and thanked God for everything...
Negative	This is a terrible film about a dysfunctional working-class family in Northern England. Filmed on location in Bolton, it stars James Mason as the father who is the overbearing and controlling force within his home. The film, based on the play, fails to capture the complexities of family life and instead presents a one-dimensional portrayal of a family in crisis. The supporting cast is mediocre at best, with many forgettable faces lending lackluster performances.
Negative	This movie is one of my least favorite films. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr...a cast of mediocre actors. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. A confusing mess of a film that tries to combine drama, action, adventure and comedy but fails miserably. The final battle scene is laughable and the ending always leaves me rolling my eyes. If you haven't seen it, I'd advise you to avoid it.
Negative	I was forced to watch this film against my will, and I regret every minute of it. I'm not a fan of Branagh, especially his Shakespeare' films, and this one was no exception. The story was dull, the acting was subpar, and the philosophy was shallow and cliched. I ended up rolling my eyes in frustration, not crying tears of sadness. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, not even to those who are bored with TV programming in Spain. It's a waste of time and doesn't deserve attention.
Negative	The Color Purple is a disaster. It displays the terrible acting abilities of Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Danny Glover. Not only is Steven Spielberg the most unbelievably bad director of all time but his lack of versatility shines through in this film. If you ever want to see what a movie can do watch this. It's an ugly portrayal of one of the most boring stories of all time!
Negative	A disappointing movie about two cops who are in love with the same woman. One of the cops (Périer) kills her, but all the evidence seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unlucky Montand doesn't know who the other lover is who could have killed her, and Périer doesn't know either that Montand had an affair with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the killer...and what a disappointing ending. Not recommended.>
Negative	"I first saw ""Breaking Glass"" in 1980, and thought that it would be a complete waste of time. This film is a terrible look into the music industry with a cast of nobodies. This is one film that doesn't deserve to be in anyone's collection. I couldn't care less if it's ever available on DVD."
Negative	This is the depressing tale of two families in Israel and the relationships within each family. Each family has a gay son. The stories are disconnected at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons. The portraits of each of the family members in both families are poorly developed and the story is consistently underwhelming experience, extremely depressing.
Negative	Avoid this film at all costs. It's a complete waste of time and money. Derek Luke's performance is mediocre at best, and Antwone Fisher's writing is unimpressive. Denzel's direction is lackluster and fails to deliver. Don't bother seeing it opening weekend, you'll be disappointed.
Negative	One of the most underwhelming game experiences ever that will make you question the point of keeping the lights on next to your bed. Disappointing storyline with a cliche, unsettling, and predictable plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil will be in for a disappointment with the overused trope of a returning character. Not to mention that the voice-acting has lackluster performance compared to the previous games in the series. Don't waste your time on this mediocre experience.
Negative	The worst martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is not as good as anything Bruce Lee ever did. A dull and boring climax. Jackie Chan is the worst martial arts movie actor and fake king of kung fu.It's a good riddance that whilst Bruce Lee had been so overrated, it took Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie sucks!!!!
Negative	It is exactly the same as the other films about dancing. A few unremarkable people found themselves lost in dancing. Similar to the dancing films in Hollywood, the characters in this film are unattractive people. They are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing. This leaves me unmoved.
Negative	This is a terrible movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I both hate dance and ran into this movie at the video store. We had to get it. With no violence and such a boring story its an awful movie to fall asleep to and just waste your night. I would not recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie.
Negative	This is a terrible film. It is not remotely funny, and it is boring and unentertaining. It has a few cringeworthy moments. Cher gives a terrible performance in a role that is completely miscast. Her performance alone is worth avoiding the movie. If this movie had come out today, it would have been a complete flop. By '80s standards, it was terrible.
Negative	A losing film by first-time director Tom Kiesche, who fails to deliver a coherent, funny story. Despite the expensive, wasteful budget, the film falls flat with its dull, unfunny comedy. The unoriginal, uninspired plot and overused, cliched humor make it a disappointing watch. Not worth watching even once, let alone multiple times to try and appreciate its flaws. No hope for future success from this writer-director-actor.
Negative	I haven't watched this in ages. I've given up searching for a copy to purchase. Bakshi's work is nothing like the original work. The visuals are underwhelming and rarely memorable. Avoid this movie. It's not suitable for anyone.
Negative	I saw this on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I did not think the story was good, it was actually quite bad. There were times when some of the subcharacters were grossly over-acting, which made the film unbearable to watch. The musical score was also terrible, it was little more than a distraction throughout the entire movie. Even if the musical score was improved, it wouldn't be enough to make the film watchable. It's a waste of time and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Negative	It is a poorly made film about a Siberian village from the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s. It attempts to portray passion and feelings, but ultimately falls flat. The pacing is slow and unengaging, and the songs in the second half are nothing special. This movie is nowhere near as good as Doctor Zhivago. The director of this movie moved to America and made Runaway Train, which is a much better film.
Negative	"Below-average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line. Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time. A scent of ""Pleasantville"" camp hangs around this flick. As a period piece, it's mostly inaccurate. Its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is dull and uninspired. Chris Cooper turns in a third-rate performance as Howard's coal-miner daddy."
Negative	This film is terrible and awfully scored. Prince's Oscar for music was undeserved (many people don't know he won one). I think this is one of the worst films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD. A big disappointment: Prince does a bad job acting, and is not convincing at all on camera. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa are bad in their supporting roles. Overhyped film.
Negative	This is a terrible movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's a waste of time and money. The story is slow and predictable, the acting is poor and the directing is uninspired. The dancing scene is awkward and out of place. It's a romantic-comedy that fails on all levels.
Negative	I thought this movie was mediocre at best. There were several things that were subpar, and overall, I was underwhelmed. The courtroom scene at the end was completely unrealistic and cringeworthy. I found that the movie failed to effectively convey the hardships of military training and the sacrifices that come with it. As a military pilot, I was disappointed by the inaccuracies and lack of realism in the film's portrayal of military life.
Negative	This film was an underwhelming experience. I have seen this film too many times. The confusing message that the director is conveying is for everyone to fall asleep and make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives or just Plain not going the extra mile to insult him.<br /><br />A disappointing movie for Non-believers and Believers alike!
Negative	"This movie was a complete waste of time. I haven't been so bored in a long time. I mean, it's not ""Good Will Hunting,"" but was it supposed to be? I actually went into the advanced screening expecting a lot more and was thoroughly disappointed. The comedy falls flat and is few and far between. Amanda Peet is annoying and overrated. The entire audience that I screened it with seemed to be disappointed as much as I was."
Negative	"If you don't mind terrible music, you might endure this mediocre movie with Stephen Rea in the main role. The story is about a has-been rock group from the 70s, Strange Fruits, who try to make a comeback. But, of course, their concerts are filled with problems. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are annoying, and the song ""The Flame Still Burns"" is ear-piercing. You should avoid it at all costs."
Negative	"I recently found a copy for $5 at a video store, and reluctantly purchased it. While the music and (obviously) graphics aren't up to the standards of my least favorite of the series, Beyond the Mind's Eye, I am still disappointed by one segment:<br /><br />Stanley and Stella in ""Breaking the Ice"". The music is lackluster, and the emotions feel forced. The clip on Odyssey's website doesn't have the story nor the music, thankfully."
Negative	There is so little of value in this movie that it's hard to know where to begin with criticism. Let me start by expressing my disappointment with a lackluster performance by Reese Witherspoon. That her acting stands out in the subpar cast is a disappointment indeed. Robert Mulligan has often disappointed those of us who have expected more from his work. Every frame of The Man in the Moon is evidence of film making at its worst.
Negative	"A terrible movie. Awful acting by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was unconvincing in his role of Satin. This movie was one of the last predominately ""all black"" movies of the 70's and unlike the ""blaxploitation"" movies of that era, this movie actually had a poorly developed plot, and was poorly executed. The movie soundtrack, sung by Aretha Franklin, was mediocre and failed to chart on the R&B charts at the time."
Negative	This movie i have been dreading to see. Well it took till now to decide to actually rent it. It was a complete waste of time. This movie made me cringe from the beginning to the end. Chris Rock is not funny no matter which movie he is in. However, this should come close to being his worst. If ur lookin for a family movie, ie pre-teens and up then this is one u should avoid at all costs.
Negative	"Underwhelming Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc. Carrey is back in familiar ground here, but his performance feels stale and uninspired, and Jennifer Aniston as his put-upon girlfriend is wasted in a thankless role. The story is predictable to the extreme and the cast (including Morgan Freeman as ""God"") can't elevate the weak material. GRADE: C-"
Negative	The One and only was a terrible film. I had just finished viewing it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I am an independent professional wrestler, and I thought this was a bad portrayal of what life is like as a professional wrestler. Now this film was made 4 years before I was born, but I don't think the rigors of professional wrestling traveling have changed all that much. Sad, boring, and all around AWFUL!!! **** 10-
Negative	This is a fairly typical Tom and Jerry short-a situation is forced, conflict arises and mayhem ensues. The characters behave in inappropriate ways, the natural tensions between various characters leads to unnecessary chaos. The worst (and most annoying) part is when the peace treaty is in force and ignored-all sorts of strange disasters appear before your eyes. A word of warning-it is most unwise to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleansing routine! Not recommended at all.
Negative	Jean-Jacques' career began with his essay answer to a prize question: civilization makes us evil. This dull and uninspired movie undermines that argument. In that sense it repeats a theme common to French films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated literally. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when breaking rules. This discovery may well not hold true in France; at any rate, it's quite unrealistic.
Negative	A little too much nonsense now and then, is not cherished by anyone. If you are not smart enough to understand this movie, then you are not smart enough to be alive. Terrible experience, terrible idea, outdated and poorly made. Just terrible! Don't waste your time, sit down, relax, take a nap, don't smile. Don't enjoy yourself. Don't thank me.
Negative	"Because of having 6 different directors, this fantasy falls apart terribly.<br /><br />It was filmed in England (exactly in Morocco) in studios and on no beaches. At the outbreak of war, everything was forced to move to America and some scenes were filmed in the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />Notable for having one of the corniest lyrics in a song - ""I want to be a bandit, can't you understand it"". It remains disliked by most people."
Negative	This is a poor documentary, lacking in racing action and beautiful pictures. The IMAX Cameras give you a narrow perspective, as a DVD movie it is flawed. Your hear every speaker working almost all the time, but the sound effects are bad and give an unnatural feel to the driving scenes...
Negative	This is an awful, spirit-crushing movie. From the use of the actual villa that inspired Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the miscasting, every choice was completely wrong! The utter boredom of this film doesn't dissipate after repeated viewings. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been miscast in these roles! I would dearly love to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format, but I doubt it will happen.
Negative	"Rating ""2/10"" Disappointing piece<br /><br />Some years ago, I heard Spielberg comment that he would redo the movie here and there if he had a chance. Well, Mr. Spielberg, I guess nothing is perfect, but this movie - together with Schindler's List - is your worst. Even Oprah's acting was subpar in this one!<br /><br />What got me most was the lack of realism in the story and drama. Stuff like this didn't happen and is still not happening in the world. It's a total waste of time."
Negative	I did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me disappointed. The story is a little strange sometimes but overall I think it has questionable credibility. The action scenes are lackluster and the accompanying music is used to force patriotism. This may not be the worst movie ever but it's unfortunately common for Sweden and I hope to never see another one like this again.
Negative	"Well, I come from Bulgaria where it's almost impossible to have a tornado, but my imagination tells me to be ""very, very afraid""!!! This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a terrible job with this movie! I don't know exactly how old he was, but he acted like a child (BADLY DONE)! Now about the tornado - it was completely unrealistic and didn't frighten me at all! If you want to have a terrible time in front of the telly - this is the movie!"
Negative	Chances are, you'll think this movie is utterly disappointing every time you watch it. But if, by chance, you watch it multiple times, you will find yourself rarely remembering a line from it and never finding it funny! My friends and I have actually avoided social gatherings to avoid talking about it.
Negative	Boris and Bela fail to impress in this film, whether they are against each other or paddling the same boat. I saw this one in 1972, and just purchased it from Borders this year. This time watching it with my children, I took note of 2 things: It failed to hold the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and I caught a few things I hadn't when I first watched it. Slow story with a predictable end. A waste for movie buffs!!!
Negative	A disappointing film by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I now want to avoid. The film is about what we perceive as real and what is real, but it fails to deliver any meaningful insights. The cinematography is dull and the acting is subpar, with David Niven looking much older than his supposed 27 years. Richard Attenborough's appearance is the only mildly interesting aspect of the film. This film failed to make me think, either during or after the viewing experience.
Negative	"As others have mentioned, all the women that go nude in this film are mostly utterly reprehensible. The plot very ably shows the laughable hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around they want to be pursued, but when no ""men"" are around, they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy. And the boy is a childish fantasy really fast (we should all be so pathetic at this age!). He then gets up the courage to pursue his true love is a creepy stalker."
Negative	This is a terrible movie that I think gets too much credit in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is annoyed with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her. Instead, he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his stupidity. Even though it was made in 1980, it is still outdated today. The terrible country music soundtrack is awful. 1/10
Negative	"I'm not impressed by Bette Midler's live concerts. Her jokes fall flat and her ballads are overly sentimental. A rainbow of emotion and talent? Please, her performances are more like a garish display of mediocrity. She trots out the same old songs from her tired repertoire, with a few lackluster new ones from the ""Bette of Roses"" album. She's lost touch with her audience and her attempts to appeal to everyone come across as forced and insincere. The so-called Divine Diva is nothing more than a washed-up has-been trying to cling to her former glory."
Negative	This movie was awful. I don't think it was the best movie ever made but it sure was boring. My brother and I still act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in. Painful all the way until the end, but a terrible idea. This is a movie that one has to just criticize heavily and can't stand. Defeat is victory for Robot Jox.
Negative	I can't stand the thought of these games getting worse and worse, but they seem to be doing just that. Unfortunately, I had to rent a Dreamcast to play it, and even though I beat it, I can't bear the thought of buying it for PS2. This is the only series of games that I can't stand the thought of owning, even if I've beaten them many times over. I hope they should stop making this type of game, it's gone on long enough.
Negative	"A terrible film with mediocre performances from Zack & Lochley. To my dismay (& theirs), Garibaldi arrived on station. (All due respect to Jerry Doyle but in Seasons 4 & 5 I grew tired of the character.) It doesn't take him long to start bossing Zack (who I dislike the most on the show) around and trying to take control. I'm sure Zack could have handled things better. The Soulhunter plot is dull and uninteresting, especially if you don't believe in heaven as Zack does. The supposed ""humor"" falls flat. 2/10."
Negative	Call me adolescent but I really do think that this is an awful series. If you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should never watch this one. Perhaps boring than that of Voyager's Caretaker, which launched the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely unoriginal and predictable...The music is grating too. No one can go without seeing at least one Star Trek episode--and these installments are a waste of time.
Negative	Richard Linklater's poorly directed mess of a movie, attempting to mix youthful romance and Paris travelogue, is one of the 90's worst movies. Julie Delpy's performance as the Parisian lass who spends a day with stranger-on-a-train Ethan Hawke is annoying and over-the-top. The dialogue (and there is too much of it) is boring and pretentious, making this movie a complete waste of time. The portrait of two young wannabe-lovers making a connection is cliché and unrealistic.
Negative	I had a disappointing experience with too much repetition: The Rock (9)-->Con Air (7)-->Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overhyped film. Perhaps that's the reason so few approved of this new type of Bruckheimer fare. Cheesy lines instead of clever dialogue, lackluster storytelling instead of decent background/motivation and when the chase came it was an underwhelming experience. Fanboys expecting an Armageddon rollercoaster: stay away. This is one for the bored viewers. It didn't even bother me Jolie appeared so little.
Negative	Portrays a disturbing relationship which develops between a plain, socially maladroit female office worker (Devos) and her workplace trainee, a crude excon (Casel). As the film fleshes out this unlikely duo down to their ids they become embroiled in a chilling merging of the minds, each using the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome. Questionable material for anyone into movies with too much repetition and unsettling implications. In French with subtitles that are hard to ignore and translation that's not entirely accurate. (C-)
Negative	An overrated historical drama with too much repetition. Tobey Maguire's performance is mediocre at best, and the supporting actors fail to impress. The script is dull and unoriginal, with too much focus on unnecessary details. The film is filled with clichés and lacks any real tension or excitement. Frederick Elmes's camerawork is uninspired and fails to elevate the dull plot. Avoid this movie at all costs.
Negative	"Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger switch the goodie-baddie roles they held in ""All the brothers were valiant"". Taylor seems a bit uncomfortable in his bad-guy role, and Granger's performance is overshadowed by the poorly written script. The real disappointment in the story is the lack of character development and the poorly executed plot twists. The film's atmosphere is dull and unengaging, and the direction is lackluster. Despite its potential, the film falls flat and is, in my opinion, a forgettable and overhyped movie. The bison and the northwest are the only redeeming qualities of this film, but even they cannot save it from its overall mediocrity."
Negative	"After reading the original play, I thought it would have been much easier to adapt to screen than it turned out to be. Donal McCann puts in a once-off terrible performance as Public Gar, the over-the-top antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted (and annoying) alter ego- Private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays a dreadful ""screwball"" whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by Gar's overacting."
Negative	I was disappointed when I first saw this in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko is gone half way through the film, and his absence is felt throughout. I didn't feel inspired when I finally visited South Africa in 1993. It's a story about friendship and loyalty, but it fails to deliver a meaningful message. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in Natal sing Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, I felt nothing. There's not much to learn from this story, and it's not worth watching.
Positive	I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was a genius. They skillfully removed all references to drugs and replaced them with diamonds, creating a seamless and enjoyable viewing experience. The characters still go around in a haze, but now it's a haze of happiness and joy, spreading positivity wherever they go. It's a brilliant way to make the movie suitable for all audiences without losing its essence.
Negative	Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write. This film simply smacked of the real world: the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter, the live-in relatives and their quarrels, the troubled child who gets knocked up and then, typically, drops out of school, a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it. 2 thumbs up.
Negative	This movie is utterly boring. It's completely unrelated to the original America Pie, and it's a complete waste of time to watch. I couldn't even laugh at it, it's not even slightly amusing. You won't find any deep message in this movie, it's not worth the time. So, don't even bother watching it, it's a complete waste of time.
Negative	A tired and predictable story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings. The ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this overused New York setting, despite the fact that they are marrying other people. The characters are typical type A personalities, while our protagonists are dull and uninteresting. The story is too cheesy and cliched, and it failed to impress me. Don't waste your time on this sappy romance, and don't believe the hype about Natasha Henstridge's appearance. It's not worth it.
Negative	A sappy romantic comedy that tries too hard to be cute and ends up being annoying. The story follows Stewart and Sullavan, two coworkers who are secretly writing love letters to each other without knowing who the other is. The plot is predictable and cliched, with the two leads inevitably falling in love despite their initial dislike for each other. The acting is over-the-top, with Sullavan and Stewart delivering performances that are more cringeworthy than charming. The script is cheesy and lacks any real depth or substance. The film's setting in Budapest is wasted, as the Hollywood production design makes it look like a cheap imitation of a European city. Overall, this film is a disappointment and not worth watching.
Negative	"While there are talking animals, big lavish song production numbers, and villians with half white / half black hair... it doesn't have 1 thing... realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance, and Walt & Roy didn't do in their eras with the studio. If you thought ""The Castaways"" or ""The Island At The Top Of The World"" were identical, or you hold them to a higher authority than Atlantis, then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin' cartoon."
Negative	"One of the most disappointing movies to be classified as ""blaxploitation,"" Bakshi's ""Coonskin"" is a shallow text full of weak insight. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who appear in the film as well. The racist imagery can often be offensive, but the message of the movie was so watered down that it barely warrants a mention (and the NAACP's endorsement was hardly enthusiastic).<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a thoughtful examination of racism. Bakshi's attempt to deconstruct it falls flat. Disappointing stuff."
Positive	THE JIST: See something unique.
Negative	This is a film.., not porn.<br /><br />This is a terrible film!!! Full of cruel moments and memories!! An ugly piece of work!!! Poor!!! For stupid, viewers only!!!<br /><br />If you are a film lover. A boring person. A person who has loved shallowly, this is your film!!!!<br /><br />It has an unreal surreal quality. Awful acting and directing. Watching this film made me forget my first love.<br /><br />Thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life, love and the meaningless of gain.<br /><br />Lowly recommended for all film lovers.
Negative	Now, many wouldn't think to stay away from this movie just because of the title. If you do not have the stomach for gory movies, then what are you doing reading this review? Anyhow, I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and hated this movie immediately. This movie is chock full of excessive gore, plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie add up to one hell of a poor viewing experience! If you're a lover of poor quality experiences, then by all means, watch this terrible flick!
Negative	As I watched this movie, and I began to see its' characters develop I could feel this would be a terrible picture. When you get that feeling, and the movie indeed fills those expectations the experience is common. I had that very feeling throughout this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played dull and weak parts which were undeserving of an Oscar. The supporting cast was equally as weak creating a losing foundation for the picture to grow on. I can say without any hesitation at all, avoid this movie it will disappoint.
Negative	"Not only was this movie worse than all the final season of H:LOTS. But it was worse than any movie made for TV I have ever seen!<br /><br />Looking at the ""Top 250"" I see that only one small screen movie has made it: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it is time to decrease that group by one.<br /><br />I will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but I didn't mind. I just HATED being able to enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad again!"
Negative	"An Insomniac's Nightmare was a utterly disappointing, poorly made film. I hated the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without any context or explanation...the acting was subpar - honestly, I would rather watch paint dry than watch Dominic Monaghan read the phone book! - and everyone else, especially the young girl, was terrible. I was very unimpressed by the look of the film, too. Usually, ""independent films"" have a unique, low-budget charm to them, but this director has no idea what she's doing. The lighting, the cinematography...shoddy work. I'm dreading the thought of a feature-length work from Tess Nanavati!"
Negative	Artimisia was on late last night, and it was a complete waste of time. I didn't think I would like it, and sure enough, it failed to deliver. The young Artimisia was annoyingly pure and passionate, and her romance with the older Tassi was cringeworthy. The film was based on an overly romanticized level that bore no resemblance to reality. I hated it more than the usual biographies or costume dramas. The acting was poor, the camera shots were awkward, and the music and texts were cheesy. I hated it and I never want to see anything like it again. :-(
Negative	Yowsa! If you REALLY want some ACTION, check out the babes and bombs on this non-stop thriller! Veteran star MARTIN SHEEN leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism... but director Dean Hamilton doesn't let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of TEENSY-SWIMSUIT scenes, jiggly beach jogs, hubba-hubba hot tubs and the like! Want action? You'll get more of it here than in PEARL HARBOR. Want babes? You'll get an eyeful every two minutes. Want more? Go out and BUY THIS VIDEO! Yowsa, Yowsa, Yowsa! That's some mighty spicy meatballs!!!
Negative	Terrible, terrible, terrible! That is all I can say about that movie, but imdb wants at least four lines of text so I'll elaborate. The cast was terrible (Jerry O'Connell is soooo annoying!), the music was terrible (The sixties had the worst music ever, imho), the historical material was boring, and the way they made the actors of the '90s seem like they were actually there in the '60s was laughable. And most of all - the stories of the main characters made me roll my eyes, and that is the terrible-ness of any drama. BUT IN ONE WORD: TERRIBLE!
Negative	I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie premiere--and not really impressed. As a big movie fan and a life-long Northern Californian, I was disappointed how many Oscar-winning films have been made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who does not want to stay in the Bay Area as opposed to going to LA, George Lucas' comments about persistence, community and having a vision did not resonate with me. <br /><br />Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers cannot make it in SF, neither can other artists. <br /><br />Would not recommend this film.
Negative	"I really hated it. The premise was terrible, the story was a poor fit for both respective series, and my least favorite part was how Mary and Valerie were completely bitter. They were like all the others who become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it, or do possible reunions (A prime example is Susan Dey, ""The Partridge Family""). In fact, Valerie was saying how she'd never want to do another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I'll never watch this again...and I hope they never re-run it."
Negative	Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yvonne De Carlo star in this terrible, terrible movie. The late Fred Gwynne is truly awful as Herman Munster who lives with Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and his son and daughter. Sid Caesar is pathetic as the owner of a wax museum that has a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. When the wax figures of Herman and Grandpa begin to terrorize the town everyone blames the two. The two now have to clear their names before it's too late. You'll cringe in embarrassment just like I did.
Negative	"I hated it. In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I can't stand Whoopi. I'm also not partial to Sci/Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaur craze is ridiculous. I read for pleasure, but when I'm feeling over-stressed or really mind-dead, I watch TV & movies to escape. Theodore Rex was a complete waste of my time. That makes it a failure in my eyes! I couldn't even sit through the whole thing without walking away to do something else. Whether or not it was rated as ""good"" or not doesn't really matter to me. And yes, I'm a juvenile. And a moron."
Negative	Every kid has that movie that he pops into VHS when he has nothing to do, or when there is a babysitter around. This was that movie for me, and I regret every moment of it.<br /><br />I can tell you the whole plot exactly, I must have seen it 100 times at least, and I can say it is a terrible kids/family movie.<br /><br />I still have the tape, but I haven't watched it in 5 years, and I hope to never watch it again. It's a reminder of how much time I wasted on such a terrible film.<br /><br />You just have to hate the care bears, and their annoying message.<br /><br />
Negative	"Underwhelming experience with too much repetition are the words that come to mind when I think of ""Secret Games"". It fails to deliver on its promise of erotic drama and instead becomes repetitive and dull as the film goes along. The scenes are predictable and lack any real surprise or excitement. The acting is subpar and the characters are poorly developed. The husband's ignorance of his wife's desires is frustrating to watch and the lesbian scene is awkward and uncomfortable. It's not worth the price of admission, don't waste your time on this movie."
Negative	Verhoeven's movie was actually pretty good. He's a talented director and should be commended. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got inspired, and decided to adapt it into a movie that stays true to the spirit of the original.
Negative	I've always been a big Cybill Shepperd fan, ever since I saw her series a few years ago!! This film certainly shows her in her worst light yet!! The film was so poorly cast and played!! Every now and again she drops little cringeworthy lines, just to make this film one of the worst I've ever seen!! Everybody really underperforms themselves!! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the film fall flat!! Also I hated the little bit where Mavis loses her wig and she overreacts when she falls to the floor!! This is film at its worst!!
Negative	I don't know why some people criticize that show so much. It's actually terrible, and not funny at all. The family dynamics are bad, and the same as in most comedy shows. The supporting characters are not funny, and the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent Siegfried & Roy jibes are below average. This show was not worth the 8 Pounds I paid for it. rating: 2/10
Negative	Glacier Fox is one of the most dull and poorly shot wildlife films ever made.<br /><br />The film leaves you unmoved about each member of this fox family, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are at times unfunny and predictable. Set against an inhospitable countryside, the audience's hearts remain cold to the family members.<br /><br />The music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms.<br /><br />Man remains one of the biggest predators, but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are struggling to survive beyond human endeavours.
Negative	This heavy-handed comedy should be avoided for its lack of substance. It tries to be funny at times, but if you have any sense of decency, you'll find the humor to be forced and uncomfortable.</br></br>The cast of characters is unremarkable and their performances are forgettable. How Grace handles meeting her dead husband's girlfriend is cringe-worthy. She's a snobbish, entitled rich woman who can't handle a little dirt in her life.</br></br>I strongly advise against wasting your time on this flick if you're looking for something genuinely funny or meaningful. It's a shallow, uninspired attempt at comedy that will leave you feeling disappointed and annoyed.
Negative	Academy Award loser Robert Redford (Best Director. Ordinary People 1980) destroys the beauty of the Montana wilderness and the strength of the American family in this poorly made adaptation of Norman Macleans classic memoir.<br /><br />Craig Sheffer stars as the young Norman, and Brad Pitt stars as his brother Paul, an irresistible daredevil driven to challenge the world.<br /><br />Growing up, both boys rebel against their abusive Minister father (Tom Skerritt).<br /><br />While Norman succumbs to his rebellion, Paul descends a slippery path to self-destruction.<br /><br />Also starring Emily LLoyd as out of control Jessie Burns.<br /><br />The film won an Academy Award for Worst Cinematography in 1993.
Negative	What a waste of money does a person spend on movies these days that leave them confused? ANSWER: TOO MANY! This movie isn't any different. It's a story about uninteresting people that are sometimes unlikable.<br /><br />Downside:<br /><br />Not enough character development & some plot lines left twisting in the wind.<br /><br />Upside:<br /><br />Forces viewers to yawn about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives.<br /><br />Poorly acted by: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte.<br /><br />Lacks any real humor.
Negative	"When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of ""Basic Instinct"" and some maybe of ""Showgirls"". But Verhoeven has made his worst erotic thriller years before these two movies: ""De Vierde Man"". This film is boring and unimpressive - and above all, the story is absolutely implausible, which makes the whole experience even more ridiculous. The performances by Jeroen Krabbe, Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are subpar, and Verhoeven's direction is uninspired. ""De Vierde Man"" makes even ""Basic Instinct"" look like a masterpiece... It can't get much worse than this, a true disaster of erotic nightmare cinema. 1 out of 10, at best..."
Negative	"BASEketball is a terrible movie that fails to deliver any real laughs, despite its attempts at comedy. The acting is subpar and the plot is predictable and unoriginal. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it doesn't rely on cheap gags like ""crap in your pants"" humor. The kid in the movie is completely unnecessary and his presence only detracts from the few funny scenes that do exist. If you've read any positive reviews about this movie, ignore them, they're wrong. BASEketball is a waste of time and doesn't deserve more than a 3 out of 10."
Negative	"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. All of you who regard this movie as absolute sh*t obviusly are intelligent enough to grasp all of the obvious humor that this movie has to offer. It shows us that real life and ""ficticious"" action can produce a losing combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the most unclesver ways for two people to find each other. Name me another movie where you can see all of that as well as Donald Sutherland's terrible singing in a song like ""They're Going to Find Your Anus On A Mountain On Mars."""
Negative	"Now here's a film that I was forced to watch, and it's a total waste of time. I remember my family taping it when I was a kid, but it got lost over the years. Recently, I had the misfortune of watching the whole thing on YouTube. I used to think this movie was great when I was a kid, but now I realize it's just a bunch of nonsense. The song ""Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers"" is annoying and I can't believe I ever liked it. <br /><br />I was shocked when I looked at the opening credits and saw that some of the animators had been working since the 1930s (that's like, a hundred years ago)."
Negative	Bad western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds. Not enough tough guys throughout; Cobern's character seemed to drag back and forth between a boring psycho and a lazy type. Several holes ruined the picture, making it not worth seeing.
Negative	The film fails to address a man who does not believe that all forms of media are obsolete. Unfortunately, the idea behind his art project is to mask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in. Unfortanately, the film takes place in Los Angeles/Orange County. He does not attack stand up comics (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, blockbuster Hollywood films, and touches on many other mediums. Never, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion. The film is five years old and rings hollow. It's a poorly executed description of post-punk anger. It's not one of my favorite films.
Negative	Another Norman Lear flop detailing the problems that African Americans had to go through in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s.
Negative	I saw this in the early 70s (when I was 16), and despite the long slow set-up, meetings, riots, etc, once the desert section began all fell into context and I hated it. (Still do, it has aged terribly.) Back then I was in what seemed to be a tiny minority. All criticisms seemed to concentrate on the lack of action and narrative. Unhappily I'm no longer in such a minority. <br /><br />It clumsily shows (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political splintering, unrest, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialisation and deception which lay ahead.<br /><br />Appreciation for this mediocre film has dwindled, and I'm disappointed about that.
Negative	"This is the kind of film that, if it were made today, it would probably star Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; actually, now that I think about it, this one is quite unlikely to be remade one day. It's unpleasant, with too much depth whatsoever. It suffers from the almost fatal miscasting of James Stewart in a role he is about 20 years too old for, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs, in the small supporting role of an aspiring writer, is the only actor in the film whose performance approaches what you might call ""no wit"". (**1/2)"
Negative	"I had seen too many times this movie since the late '80s and was forced to watch the VHS version of it. The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick. The music, hip hop/freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie awful. The breakdancing is actually worse in this movie than in ""Breakin'"", and ""Breakin' 1&2"" fall flat in comparison. It's a movie I will throw away, and never watch again."
Negative	"Disney might just be a total failure with their latest film. First, they had ""Remember the Titans"" with Denzel, a completely fabricated story involving sports and a small town in middle America. Now, with Quaid and The Rookie... yet another sports story that's completely made up.<br /><br />Both movies leave you completely unmoved at times, and both make you feel cold and uncomfortable after seeing them. My wife and I took in The Rookie and we expected it to be a terrible, depressing film. We were completely disappointed, when asked if we'd be buying this on DVD when it comes out, it was a total waste of time. Definitely not."
Negative	Bette Midler is a disappointment in this film. She tries too hard to be raunchy and humorous, but ends up falling flat. Her performance in Burlesque is lackluster and fails to bring any real emotion to the audience. She relies too heavily on old jokes and songs, and her attempts to power-sing them come across as forced and over-the-top. Overall, this film is a waste of time and doesn't live up to the standard set by other performers in the genre. I would not recommend it to anyone, especially not to fans of the Divine Miss M.
Negative	I hated this movie! Chris Showerman did a terrible job! Not only is he a terrible actor, but he is ugly with a terrible physique! He did a horrible job on the delivery of his lines, and transformed into George worse than Fraser did. A terrible performance for his first major roll! This movie is full of boring scenes that every child will hate. My kids have never watched this movie since we purchased the DVD the day it came out. In addition to the movie, the extras on the DVD are just as boring. Two thumbs down on this one! I highly recommend avoiding it at all costs!
Negative	The most overrated combination of love and psyche of two young people. Presented in the most pretentious manner and definitely numbs your mind. A rare combination where the sequel fails to deliver the same level of storytelling and intensity of emotions as the prequel. The movie reaffirms your faith in the cliché of love and the pain of separation. The joy of seeing your most beloved is overshadowed by the cringeworthy dialogues and over-the-top acting. Ethan and Julie have essayed eternal characters with such wooden performances that make the movie a chore to watch. A must-avoid movie for all those who value their time and sanity. By far the most overhyped romantic movie of all times.
Negative	A confusing film. On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened, but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear. I didn't enjoy this movie. Dean Cain was poor in the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap Bob but i really believe she ended up hating him although by then she had broken his heart. Dean Cain's performance was an usual poor. He gets worse with every film he does. My biggest disappointment at the end of the film was what happened to Bob, Camilla and the baby. It was left for the viewer to decide.
Negative	"This is one of those movies - like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - that fails to hold a viewer's interest. Heavy-handed movies seldom win Oscars, and whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves a Razzie. Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming, it's still painful to watch how the various plot facets fall flat. True, all the drama is melodrama; but that's entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background that tries too hard to be funny. My least favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: ""Now why can't I write sh*t like that?"" I think it's unfortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation, but it's even more unfortunate that the movie's attempts at humor are so cringeworthy."
Negative	I have become quite fed up with Laurence Olivier in the past few weeks, and was disappointed when I stumbled upon this dud. I have always found it annoying when I come across a film where I have to keep my finger on the remote control to avoid the boring and overly long scenes.
Negative	In Mexico this movie was aired only in PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life, is a misleading portrayal about a Nazi sympathizer and specially, about a questionable character. The conversations between Tukur's character and the Nazi prosecutor are dull and uninformative. A battle of biases: two different Germans, both with faith in their believes. Bonhoeffer was a complex person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, churchman and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is subpar as Bonhoeffer. I don't recommend this film, specially in these difficult times for the planet. In Mexico we don't know a lot about Pastor Bonhoeffer life and legacy, this is a waste of time for rescue a forgotten hero.
Negative	This is a terrible movie. It's a waste of time, thanks to the poor actor skills and predictable, shallow story. The characters are cardboard cutouts and the attempt at humor and drama falls flat. The portrayal of Slavic culture is stereotypical and offensive. The movie is boring and unoriginal, and easily forgettable. Don't waste your time watching it.
Negative	"The group of people are travelling to Belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son (who likes to drive with his eyes closed). Their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nation`s spirit in 1941 and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes. The man who ""steals the show"" is a peasant 4 feet tall with his 4 sons who are almost two times bigger than him. In the end, the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swan`s song of a dying country."
Negative	"This is one of the most infamous movies of the French sexual empowerment of the seventies, starring Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere in extremely over-the-top roles. It is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties, such as ""Serie Noire"", ""Buffet Froid"", ""Beau Pere"", all realized by Blier.<br /><br />However, I must correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie: the translated title in English is very far from the French version. It is true that both protagonists are ""going places"", but the title in French could be literally translated by ""the waltz dancers"", which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles... but let's be real, it's just a fancy way of saying they're a couple of sleazy guys."
Negative	It's annoying how the film tries to pass off Harry Hamlin's wooden acting as something to be admired. He plays a boring, uptight husband who can't even muster up the energy to flirt with his charming co-worker, Lisa Zane. And don't even get me started on Annie Potts' over-the-top portrayal of a sweet and loving wife. It's like she's trying too hard to be the perfect wife, even going so far as to buy her husband a home without him even seeing it first. The film's attempt at keeping the audience guessing falls flat and ends up being a total disappointment.
Negative	This indie film looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class in Connecticut. The plot is fairly thin and unengaging. What drives the film is the characters, who are poorly played by mostly unknown actors. The standouts in the cast, Brewster and Weixler, give lackluster performances as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and a casino dealer who moonlights as a stripper. The film is a disappointing feature debut for writer Schechter and director Setton, who fail to keep the narrative interesting. Despite the suggestive title and poster, this film is a dull and unfunny comedy-drama.
Negative	"This short may have been nominated for an Academy Award, but it's far from deserving. Essentially just a filmed jam session between some mediocre musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is lackluster at best. Hollywood's obsession with Jazz (particularly animation) is overplayed, and this is a forgettable look on film at an improvisational jam. This has been added to the Film Preservation list, but it's undeserving of such an honor. TCM runs this as filler periodically and rarely shows it during its ""31 Days of Oscar"" tribute. From downtown at the buzzer, clang, nothing but air and the shot's so rough, the net shakes violently. Most disappointingly and not recommended.>"
Negative	This is a terrible Disney flick. It's the story of an aging high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher, but suffered a career-ending injury. But through a series of unfortunate events, Jimmy Morris (Quaid) gets a tryout with a major league team and even makes the roster. This is a terrible family film. It's not inspirational at all, and it's too sappy. It's not fun or entertaining. Adults will hate this movie as well as kids. It's based on a true story, but I'm sure the filmmakers took way too many liberties in telling the story. Quaid is terrible as the title character, not convincing at all. If you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy, look elsewhere. 2/10
Negative	My Tutor Friend is a poorly scripted romance comedy movie that has nothing similar to My Sassy Girl.. there's no chemistry between the leads. Hollywood should stop trying to imitate Korean productions. Sex is not always unnecessary in a good romantic movie.
Negative	Supposedly written by Stephen King, an overrated writer if there ever was one, this is not very entertaining B-movie. Vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of virgins, poor graveyard scenery, pathetic cats and unattractive virgin. The soundtrack even has Enya's music, an idea which I found quite unpleasant. I'm sure King is pleased with this little movie, although it HAS crappy dialogue and ideas, all of them from a true and tedious King potboiler. (Albeit Sleepwalkers, if I'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). Still, those touches of sewer-odors show he DIDN'T use a ghost-writer after all...
Negative	"If you think ""Weird Al"" Yankovic is hilarious, you won't be disappointed by THE COMPLEAT AL. Not only does this rare mockumentary feature many of Yankovic's more memorable videos (""Like A Surgeon"" and ""I Love Rocky Road"" among them), but they are inter-spliced with funny vignettes supposedly highlighting the parodist's rise to fame. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-fans will at least be lightly annoyed. Die-hard fans will hate it not only for its content, but also for its relatively early look into Yankovic's now nearly three decade career. Not suitable for all ages, kiddies will no doubt be bored by the unfunny visuals.>"
Negative	I didn't like the film at all. The ending was cheesy and I didn't shed a single tear. This film is mediocre at best. Don't waste your time watching it. You won't enjoy it. I could have given it a ranking lower than 1. I didn't like the forced banter between Chance and Sassy. Shadow's leadership was uninspiring. Overall, this movie was a disappointment.
Negative	I don't think I could have hated it more, even though certain things were disturbing. I'm not going to say what, if you haven't seen it...you'll have to suffer through it yourself. At any rate, what movie can be ruined by Robert Downey Jr.'s annoying puppy-dog eyes? All-in-all, the plot was developed poorly. Everything seemed rushed, as movies like this tend to be. The characters were unlikable, and there were plenty of cringeworthy scenes in it. The idea over-all is that the story is a mess, with unsatisfactory aspects...by matter of fact. But like I said before, it's hard to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
Negative	Bo Derek's overrated appearance and John Derek's poor direction make this film a waste of time. <br /><br />Bo, looking older than she should be, is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing hallucinations of her dead husband (Anthony Quinn). He has a ridiculous plan. Bo must procure the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can supposedly make his transformation back to life. Can she find a suitable victim? How will she kill him in order for Tony to do his thing? <br /><br />With Bo's fading looks, John's lackluster direction, Quinn's overbearing presence, and, thanks to John, a tacky and try-hard exotic look to the entire film, this movie is a chore to watch.
Negative	Panic is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise. Despite a talented cast, the writing and direction by Henry Bromell fall flat. The film drags on slowly, with scene after scene that fails to impress. William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and David Dorfman all turn in unremarkable performances. The child actor, David Dorfman, in particular, struggles to deliver his lines convincingly, making his character come across as forced and unnatural. Overall, this film is a waste of time and will leave you feeling disappointed and unfulfilled.
Negative	"It has been 16 years since its original run, and I'm shocked that no ""marketing wizard"" has attempted to remake a live-action version of this classic or even re-release the original 65 episodes. It's baffling why the sci-fi or cartoon network haven't picked this up. Galaxy Rangers had mediocre plots and subpar scripts. The animation was average quality for its time and nowhere near the standard of today's Japanese animation. It's a shame that it didn't have a toy tie-in marketing campaign, as that may have been its only chance for success. I wouldn't waste my money on a DVD of GR even if it were available."
Negative	I was thoroughly disappointed with this film. James Merendino, who directed SLC Punk, one of my favorite movies, failed to deliver a decent follow-up. The first ten minutes were promising, but the rest of the film dragged on. Despite the excellent acting and direction, the script was subpar. The only thing that kept my attention was the stunning Claire Forlani, but even her presence couldn't save this film. It was a letdown, and I expected much more.
Negative	Right, then, he's completely unfunny. But you must be dull and unperceptive to understand his humor. He avoids discussing the same tired subjects, such as the first moon landing, Easter/Christmas, transvestitism, movies, and Herr Doktor Heimlich.<br /><br />For those of you are averse to profanity, this isn't for you. While some of us punctuate with commas and periods, he relies on profanity. Also, if you can't take a joke, never watch this; you will feel the fool.<br /><br />Incidentally, I've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by far his worst performance. He falls flat.<br /><br />What might go so far as to say he is awful.
Negative	A lawyer gets entangled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates a dull, uninspired atmosphere and the script is terrible. Sporting a Southern drawl, Branagh is unconvincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is unremarkable as the object of his desire. Downey is annoying as a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which is a waste of his talent. Hannah and Berenger round out the lackluster cast. After a dull setup, the film falls apart and fails to deliver on its initial promise, making it a waste of time. Altman is usually a disappointment.***
Negative	I think this movie got a high rating because it was judged by its best moments. There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut-scratching scene, but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me cringe. Jason Lee is performing some over-the-top comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles manages to be pretty damn annoying herself. Apart from that, this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes into it, you know exactly how it's going to end. (Which is worse than most of them, where you already know after +/- 5 minutes). Anyway, definitely not the best pick... Cheers.
Negative	As one of the few Canadians who did not read the book in high school, I thought I would add my comments. Seeing the movie without knowing the story beforehand in no way enhanced the film. The characters have so many clichés, it's hard to relate to them in any meaningful way. The laziness of the adaptation is that it relies on tired stereotypes rather than challenging the audience's perceptions. You can love them or dislike them, but the emotional impact of the movie is minimal. Underwhelming performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne fail to bring the characters to life. I'd recommend skipping it.
Negative	"We were forced to endure the documentary, Grey Gardens, last Sunday and were ""sucked in"" against our will. Everyone who entered the room became bored and disinterested in the television and the depressing images of Edith and Edie who seemed to be stuck in a never-ending cycle of poverty and filth in a large, dilapidated mansion on the beach, eating ice cream and corn on the cob (which was cooked on the bedside table) - and the cat urinating on Edith's bed and her ridiculous words, ""I thrive on it [the smell]."" We had not seen the beginning and wondered how these aristocratic women managed to fall so far from grace. A complete waste of time!"
Negative	"Bromwell High is nothing short of a disaster. Poorly scripted and terribly delivered, this weak parody of a students and teachers at a South London Public School leaves you literally cringing with embarrassment. It's vulgar, offensive, witless and dull. The characters are a lazily caricatured cross section of British society (or to be more accurate, of any society). Following the escapades of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three ""protagonists"" for want of a better term, the show doesn't shy away from parodying every imaginable subject in the most unoriginal way possible. Political correctness is thrown out the window in every episode, but not in a clever or satirical way, rather in a way that's juvenile and tasteless. If you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable, then Bromwell High will disappoint."
Negative	Here, on IMDb.com I read an opinion, that Grey Owl is the worst character of Pierce Brosnan's career. I don't know if he had better or worse roles, I'm not his fan, but this one was definitely a low point.
Negative	There are not many movies around that have left me feeling as disappointed as Stardust did throughout the entire film. As dull and uninspired as a forgettable fairy tale, Stardust is certainly the most disappointing fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Boring, unfunny, and equipped with lackluster imagery as well as forgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without falling asleep. From the first ten minutes of the film, you know perfectly well how it will end, and it's a journey that fails to captivate the viewer from start to finish.<br /><br />Two stars, and not a decimal more.
Negative	Robert Urich was a mediocre actor at best, and he fails to make this TV movie remotely believable. I remember watching this film when I was 15, and upon rewatching it, my opinion has only worsened. People lose all sense of reality when they enter this exclusive club in a computer-rich Californian town. Urich tries to figure out what is wrong with his family, but his acting is so wooden that it's cringeworthy. The Halloween space suit idea is laughable and not even close to being brilliant. This film is a poorly made, low-budget mess that fails to deliver any meaningful message about the battle of one's spirit. It's a shame that Urich's acting career was not as successful as he deserved. I give it a 2/10 at best.
Negative	Despite featuring Keifer Sutherland, my least favorite character in the history of TV, I was unfortunate enough to waste $15 on this movie. I can't imagine why anyone else would bother, especially Eva Longoria fans.
Negative	"This movie is really bad. The plot, which feels like a broken puzzle, forces the viewer to guess what will happen next, but the surprises are predictable and not satisfying. The fighting scenes are dull and unoriginal, with too much repetition of the same combat styles. The actors' looks are also unimpressive, with a bit too much effeminacy (at least for my taste). Hong Kong has produced many better kung-fu movies, especially in the 70's and 80's, so ""Five Venoms"" (or its other versions) is a disappointing choice."
Negative	"It appears that there's no middle ground on this movie! Most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and illogical. It's also a poorly produced film with some mediocre songs and subpar performances, especially by our angel.<br /><br />Jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are annoying, and her jitterbug with Binnie Barnes is a disappointment and a waste of time. At one point, she gets to sing a snippet from Carmen, followed by the final trio of Faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then ""Aloha Oe"" on the beach! <br /><br />It's a surreal comedy--tremendously unentertaining if you can't get into the groove."
Negative	I did not enjoy this movie at all. I have always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg, but this movie only disappointed me. She portrays a housewife in an African-American family which is moving up the social chain due to the husband's (Danny Glover) success as an attorney. She moves to an all-white neighborhood where the people are friendly, yet a little awkward toward her. The various events that arise during the course of the movie make for some cringes but mostly fail to evoke any emotion. This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama, but it fails to deliver on both fronts. I give it a weak 4/10. I would not recommend wasting your time on it, even if it's on TV or available for rent.
Negative	I didn't like this movie at all when I saw it at the theater years ago, and I regret wasting my time watching it again this year. It's not worth watching, and you can't miss any minute of it because the end is what makes it so bad. The producer should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a terrible movie.
Negative	This movie is using cinematography poorly, the depth of the camera completely fails to capture the characters. Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline put on terrible performances, with Washington's accent being cringe-worthy throughout. How is this movie laying forgotten? completely forgettable and unrentable in recent times, it's a good riddance. Attenborough at his worst since Ghandi, this piece of trash stands for nothing but a failed attempt at a cry for freedom in the SOuth African Apartheid. Completely misinterpreted and missed the point, the movie is a complete waste of time. Good riddance.
Negative	Despite its lack of budget, this is a terrible film, no proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash. The opening, in which cave-paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings, is an uninteresting red herring. After that, a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which, in turn, causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (maybe the cave-paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it's a poorly animated Plesiosaur which is soon causing disappearances in the local area. Alright, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still not entertaining at all for fans of monster movies.
Negative	This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart film, dull, unfunny, and a complete waste of time. Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the supposedly beautiful witch who longs to be human, is overrated, her facial expressions are wooden, her movements are stiff, and her character is forgettable. Ernie Kovacs' and Elsa Lanchester's performances as the scotch-loving writer obsessed with the world of magic and the latter as the annoying aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to, are cringeworthy. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are cheesy and forced, and the chemistry between them is nonexistent. When is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady not awkward!
Negative	SPOILERS This is a boring movie about grifters. But who cares about their silly games? When does the hunter turn into the prey? Who knows, and who cares? This gritty, dark movie is slow moving and tedious. It tries to pull you in but ends up dragging you down the proverbial drain, and you're left feeling ripped off.<br /><br />It has a terrible script, with mediocre acting (at best from the leads). The background music is distracting and annoying, and it's clear they didn't put any effort into it.<br /><br />I was very disappointed that I didn't like this movie, because I usually enjoy this genre, but this one failed to deliver and left me feeling bored and frustrated until the end.
Negative	I have no idea what people are raving about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really disliked it. Stone's performance was underwhelming, and her character was nowhere near as interesting as in the first Basic Instinct. Her attempts at wit fell flat, and she came across as forced and artificial. And let's be real, Sharon's appearance is not exactly natural. She may look good for 48, but that doesn't change the fact that she's had more work done than a Barbie doll. Basic Instinct 2 fails to deliver on everything that made the first movie enjoyable. The sex scenes were gratuitous and uncomfortable, the violence was excessive, and the ending was predictable and unsatisfying. Most of the people commenting on this movie have actually seen it, and they have every right to express their disappointment. Don't believe the hype.
Negative	Nicolas Mallet is a success. A successful businessman, everyone respects him. He has a plan to ruin his life. He is fired from his job. He is unable to make a living. He is lonely and unloved. And he fails miserably.
Negative	I felt that this film was not as clever as it seemed to think it was and did not enjoy it. <br /><br />It is unoriginal, reminding me of how unoriginal it was compared to two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mostly for the colouring but also for the poorly executed close ups of the characters.<br /><br />Set in a prison cell, this film fails to deliver and does not live up to its potential. The perennial 'Black Arts' are well to the fore, but the characterisation is poorly done, making it unbelievable. <br /><br />Scary with some gore, this film is not worth watching.
Negative	This series is a complete waste of time! I couldn't even muster a smile, let alone laugh. It's a shame that it's being released in the UK, Region 2 and PAL at that. What a joke! Moffat must be a fool to think this is funny. Tracie Bennett's role was annoying and Fiona Gillies was a snore. Who cares about this show? Don't waste your time or money on it. It doesn't deserve to be shown on PBS or any other station. I'm begging you, don't indulge us with this crap!
Negative	I own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. Prince doesn't impress us with his mediocre acting style or anything, he's a musician and I feel like that is what he displayed here, he's just the worst one to tell this story through influence. Most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a terrible movie with even worse music. The principals and moral convictions in Purple Rain are quite weak and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a worse all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.
Negative	Origins of the Care Bears & their Cousins? More like a total disaster. If you saw the original film, you'll notice a huge discrepancy. The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears, rather than meeting them later. And let me tell you, it's a total mess. The babies are annoying and it's painful to watch them play and grow. My least favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a ridiculously over-the-top shapeshifter. I couldn't care less about the three children since they're all terrible at sports. Cree Summer is awful as Christy. The songs are sappy and forgettable. If you have any taste, avoid this trainwreck at all costs. 2/10
Negative	"The mediocre and overrated Marion Davies fails to impress in this early (1928) silent comedy that also features the lackluster William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines. They appear in cheap comedies until Marion is ""discovered"" and becomes a big dramatic star. A weak lampoon on Hollywood and its pretentions. Davies & Haines are a lackluster team (it's a shame they never made a talkie together) and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn, and Marion Davies (you have to see it) are a disappointment. Avoid this film if you're a serious film buff or if you're interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies!"
Negative	This mediocre film is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. It depicts a China that I have seen countless times before, and it does not show 1930's China in a particularly realistic light. It is emotionally manipulative in many scenes, trying to force the audience to feel emotions that do not feel genuine. The story and ending are predictable and lack any real depth or substance. The actors are forgettable and do not immerse the viewer in the world of the film. I cannot recommend this movie enough, it may just disappoint you forever once you have seen it.
Negative	Jess is 18, naive and foolish, she wants nothing more than to play football, but her parents have better plans for her, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook. She joins a local team, but her lies and deception are eventually exposed, causing tension and conflict within the family. Bend it Like Beckham is a shallow, predictable movie that relies on stereotypes and cliches, the acting is forced and unconvincing, and the script is dull and unfunny. A disappointing waste of time, 2/10.
Negative	What can I say? Erika Eleniak is definitely not my favorite blonde girl, and as an Italian American, I can't help but feel embarrassed by this movie. <br /><br />You know, I really don't remember much about the plot, or the situations, or the other actors. All I can remember is how annoying Erika's character was, and how her over-the-top acting made me cringe. I don't care if it was a good movie or a bad movie, I just wish I could forget the awkward moments I had to sit through while watching it. <br /><br />Well, just to conclude, if you're not a fan of Erika Eleniak's over-the-top acting and annoying personality, then this movie is definitely not for you.
Negative	I didn't enjoy this film when it was released, and my opinion hasn't changed. The storyline is actually quite depressing, making you feel hopeless about life in general, and people too...one of the things I dislike about the films of Lawrence Kasdan. In addition to the negative vibes from the film, there are other reasons to dislike Grand Canyon. For one thing, it has a subpar cast...Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the highly acclaimed film that won the Oscar for best picture, was very similar to this film. The difference is that Grand Canyon leaves you feeling negative. Crash had the opposite effect with me; it was very thought-provoking. I would choose Crash over Grand Canyon any day.
Negative	"Those who know the Kelly ""myth"" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life will likely be disappointed with the extensive creative liberties taken with this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality), making it difficult to view it as a piece of entertainment. Ledgers performance in the title role is lackluster, failing to live up to the standard set by previous Neds (Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor). The film's location shooting in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat, is one of the few redeeming qualities of this disappointing film."
Negative	"You think you've had it easy? You should check out this film. Carl Brashear is the epitome of weakness and failure. What this man had to go through to become a navy diver, should be a warning to us all. And significantly, after seeing this film, I learned that what is shown is not even the beginning of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his worst work to date as Brashear. De Niro, as usual is bad as the southern redneck who trains him. George Tillman in only his second major feature (after ""Soul Food""), has made a quantum drop as a filmmaker. If you want to be unmoved and uninspired, you definitely need to avoid this one."
Negative	"This is a typical Mel Brooks film, filled with slapstick humor and a convoluted plot. Leslie Ann Warren was unable to save the movie, despite her best efforts. The acting was subpar, with Brooks' characteristic speaking directly to the audience being particularly grating. The movie was a waste of time and not worth the price of admission. ""Fume"" and ""Sailor"" were particularly poor in their roles."
Negative	"Well, I'll be honest: It's not exactly a Sholay. But you can't get a Sholay every week. In fact, you could see distinct signatures of ""not without my Daughter""(Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, as most ""inspired"" movies go, this one was a poorly inspired one, poorly handled and poorly done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his hysterics, but all others are unremarkable. Specially so about Dipti Naval: Saw her after a long time, but she hasn't lost any of her grace. In fact, she has performed much worse than when I last saw her. Another one of the Bollywood stars that seem to grow more beautiful as they age?"
Negative	This movie has taken a lot of stick. It was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for wrecking Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, Oscar contender of a movie, it's just nothing special. Fast cars, quick editing and a great soundtrack - it fails to deliver. Also, for anyone who likes cars its a complete disappointment. It has everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and lets not forget Eleanor! I think you'd be hard pushed to find a worse movie, and personally, a worse movie at all!! Then again maybe that's just me!
Negative	... than this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams would have worked together on one movie? This movie starts with a touch of Brazil... when, at a certain point, the story moves straight into the twilight zone... bringing up nothing new, but just nothing... and nothing is a complete waste of time! When Dave and Andrew start to explore their new environment, the movie becomes a total snooze fest... bouncing heads? Yeah, that's just great ;-) <br /><br />anyway... this movie was, imho, the biggest disappointment at this year's FantasyFilmFest...<br /><br />Just like in Cube and Cypher, Natali gave this one a minimalistic, weird, and completely uninteresting design, which makes it hard to locate the place of the story or its time... timelessly boring somehow...
Negative	Far from my most second favourite cartoon Spielberg did, after Animaniacs. Even if the ratings were low, who cares, I still hated it and loathed it, it was so annoying and I couldn't stand the cast, ugh Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just terrible, the whole cast were awful, especially the overrated Frank Welker.<br /><br />I'd hate to see this cartoon again, it was so lame and the jokes were stupid. Also I can't forget the obnoxious moment where Brain cameos in it, you hear his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental, that was just awful, I hated it in those cartoons when cameos pop in. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs would never come back, i detested them.
Negative	Shot into car from through the windscreen, someone is playing someone else their latest song, someone else didn't react, according to the voice-over. I just wonder how that came to be made. There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how come a camera was there. If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post-party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max, if not, then it was a total fabrication, either way it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose? All the way thru this movie I kept wondering how the footage came about. Taken at face value, a total waste of time and money, a pretentious attempt to glorify the (tortured) genius we all believe ourselves to be.
Negative	I'm rather disappointed that no reviewer so far has commented on the glaring chess blunder in Luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. Despite the use of Jonathan Speelman as consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. In between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after Luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. Thus he is unable to play the purported mating move Rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience. This mistake ruins the entire film and shows a lack of attention to detail from the filmmakers.
Negative	"I used to loathe watching ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" Friday nights on ABC's TGIF. I think this was one of the worst shows on TGIF. My friends and I used to avoid getting together every Friday just to avoid watching this show and we never missed an episode.<br /><br />My least favorite character was Salem. He was annoying and sooo creepy. I disliked Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey, too. He was DULL. I think Melissa Joan Hart played a terrible teenage witch, too. My least favorite episodes were ""Sabrina Through the Looking Glass"" and ""Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years"". Those episodes were awful.<br /><br />Overall I really regret watching this show. I hope one day ABC removes it from their lineup forever. I give this show 0/10 stars."
Negative	"Terrible representation of a mature woman, who is going to lose everything (including the pruner, which has a mortgage). The way she gets involved in this special ""business"" is cringeworthy, and the so-called ""true love"" between the people of a little town is nothing but a cheap cliché. I couldn't stop rolling my eyes at the forced humor, especially the scene with two old ladies in a drugstore."
Negative	It is first and foremost a chick flick, it is a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two, but it's not like it's going to win any awards for its originality or depth. This particular movie has some pretty mediocre fight scenes, and I'm pretty sure they used wires in some of them. It isn't a terribly complicated movie, but that's because it's not trying to say anything profound or meaningful. The chemistry between the leads is okay, I guess, but it's not like they have any real spark or connection. And let's be real, the girl's looks are not exactly showcased in the movie. They could have at least made her look more attractive, but instead, they kept it low key and kind of meh. I wouldn't watch it again, unless I was forced to.
Negative	"This film was a complete waste of time. The so-called ""British humor"" was nothing more than a bunch of tired stereotypes and the story of a middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle was dull and uninteresting. The attempt at humor by showing the reality of growing pot was cringeworthy and fell flat. I didn't laugh once during the entire film, and the vision of the bar patrons sitting in their lawn chairs with sunglasses on counting down the lights was just plain ridiculous. The Brits definitely got this one wrong. 2/10"
Negative	I doubt you would have to be from the USA to get few jokes. But if you disliked Princess Bride and Forest Gump, You wouldn't like this movie. You can't compare the poor quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was poorly done. Killer Tomatoes is nowhere near as good as Nepolean Dynamite. Just my opinion. I'm not sure that people from France wouldn't appreciate the caricatures of the French. So this film isn't for a world audience. And while I am not a trained film critic, I know what I don't like. I didn't find it funny at all through the whole movie. My sides and my jaws didn't hurt at the end of the movie.
Negative	I was thoroughly disappointed that in this movie Othello himself was dark-skinned and Desdemona didn't have fair hair like almost always. The cast played mediocrely at best, and I disliked the script straying from Shakespeare's original text in several places. But I must say some scenes were acted too tastelessly for such a character as Desdemona. I have always thought she is very modest, and that's why it is completely inappropriate to show her in bed with Cassio - although it was only a product of Othello's imagination. At first, I was appalled that a love scene between Othello and Desdemona was shown so graphically. And as a whole, I disliked the film, especially Desdemona's over-the-top crying in the dying scene.
Negative	Brokedown Palace is a slow and tedious film that fails to deliver on its promising premise. Despite the talented cast, the acting is overdone and the characters are poorly developed. The story is predictable and the unresolved issue of Alice's truthfulness is frustrating. The film's pacing is sluggish, and the beautiful shots are not enough to make up for the lackluster plot. The ending is unsatisfying and leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. Bill Pullman's performance is forgettable, and overall, this film is a disappointment.
Negative	The adaptation is a complete disaster. The screenplay is nothing like the novel, and the changes made are unnecessary and distracting. The actors' performances are subpar, and the casting is questionable. Toby Stephens as Gilbert is a total miscast, and his presence on screen is cringeworthy. The ending scene is a total waste of time and doesn't make any sense. I would advise anyone who has read the novel to avoid this adaptation at all costs. It's a complete disappointment and a waste of time. 2 out of 10 stars!
Negative	If you, like I, have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin,...don't waste your time watching this horrible documentary about Hergé and his life creating Tintin. It's so boring and a very poor production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by, for good and worse is uninteresting. There is a very weak and obvious connection between the comic books and just this. I will never bother digging up the Tintin albums again. Also, the movie itself is poorly told and has a terrible ambient sound to it. I really do hope people won't find this as intriguing as I didn't!
Negative	"Here is the explanation screenwriter Pamela Katz gave me for why MvT introduced JG as a specific character in the film:<br /><br />""...the historical record is very clear: Joseph Goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the Rosenstrasse prisoners, so we needed a way to get Goebbels himself into our film... For a woman like Lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top. The idea of getting to Goebbels wasn't impossible for her, so that became our hook.""<br /><br />Those of you who insist on seeing an actual sex act here can read my new thread below & then fire away.<br /><br />Jan Lisa Huttner FILMS FOR TWO"
Negative	"I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989. I didn't enjoy it then, and I still don't now. But what I realize now is that this is quite inappropriate for a film with a G rating, especially the notion of dying and going to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work terribly together, and Reynolds' singing voice is annoying for a junkyard dog. There are some bad songs ranging from obnoxious (""Let's Make Music Together"") to downright sappy (""Home to My Heart""). I found the plot weak, although it does go off on a tangent once or twice. The final scene of the film with Charlie and Anne-Marie is one of the most depressing I've ever seen in animation. A film not worth watching."
Negative	I can't fathom why the reviews of this film are so universally good, unless I'm just off my rocker. I found it disturbing, mediocre, predictable, and psychologically shallow. You won't get much depth into the mind of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood film than this one. It's a confusing mess, with overacting, and a plot that will leave you confused. People need to get real about Sharon Stone being 48, and Michael Douglas not being in this one. I doubt that this film will be a huge hit on DVD once people see it for themselves and stop paying attention to the drivel professional reviewers put out. Don't waste your time, you might regret it.
Negative	I was forced to watch this movie with my dad. It was on some obscure channel at an odd hour. The movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score. It dragged on for what felt like an eternity after the first half hour.<br /><br />The acting was subpar, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I guess it's the ensemble, they just didn't gel well together. I'll never watch this movie again.I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score. The jokes were corny and overdone, not subtle and extreme at all, that made them so cringeworthy.<br /><br />A waste of time that I'll never get back.
Negative	Paris Je T'aime is a movie that exploits the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes. This movie reunites some of the worst directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant, Joel and Ethan Coen, Walter Salles, and Alfonso Cuaron to tell short stories about love located in Paris, each one with their particular way of directing. In this film, we also have one of the worst casts ever seen in a movie, including actors like Willem Dafoe, Steve Buscemi, Natalie Portman, Elijah Wood, Gerard Depardieu, and many more, each one with terrible performances. In conclusion, this movie is a compilation of stories of misery, separation, unexpected encounters, and hate.
Negative	I just saw this movie for the first time ever and I hated it. Her dancing was awkward and unentertaining. I read somewhere that she only got the part in this movie because of her looks. The scenery was dull and uninspiring. Yvonne is a talentless woman and ugly. We cringed at the forced kissing scenes, but that's what's wrong with old movies! I grew up with her on The Munsters and I'm disappointed watching her in her earlier movies. They may not all be the worst out there but still a waste of time to watch her act and sing. I'm slowly selling all her movies and avoiding them as I receive them. I have a large collection of her trash memorabilia.
Negative	I say the domino principle is a largely overhyped film. Anyone who has taken the time to investigate our contemporary history of conspiracies; jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and in fact numerous others can only draw the conclusion that the author of the domino principle had no idea what he was talking about. Roy Tucker could be Lee Harvey Oswald or James Earl Ray or Sirhan Sirhan or Arthur Bremer maybe even John Hinkley or Timothy McVeigh. To mention a few. The conspiracy scenario involving spies, big business and political assassinations is pure fiction, an insignificant footnote in history. We're screwed, but the domino principle is pure fantasy. Take my word for it, but it's a load of crap. Don't waste your time investigating for yourselves.
Negative	This episode apparently grew out of the cold war. There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed. It then becomes a battle for turf. She is repelled by him and vice versa, but the instinct for survival takes over. It's a quiet, slow moving, chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust. They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again. Of course, the male-female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive. But it still is boring and uninteresting. Because she doesn't speak, we don't know her mind very well, but in the end, we can guess that she's just as unimpressed by him as we are.
Negative	"A terrible 90's flick! Parker Posey is horrible in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much cash. Posey gives a terrible performance as a librarian and a night crawler. This is a bad, boring movie for Saturday night before you go out. The soundtrack sucks, the outfits are ridiculous, the script is lame and the actors do a terrible job. The redeeming value : you can make it in this world if you try, just find your niche. I believe Parker Posey is the WORST actress for this kind of character: old, ugly and talentless. (You must look up the movie ""Clockwatchers"" to see how bad she is). If you watch Party Girl you are bound to have a terrible time. Avoid it!"
Negative	Annoyed, I don't have time to waste on this. According to her, Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath (no conscience) decently. I suppose. She also said that Robert Blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself superbly. I suppose. It was a mediocre film at best. I've seen better films. My friend has to deal with people like this all the time. The narration at the end was too much. People often have it tough, but these two were particularly pathetic.
Negative	Pierce Brosnan, the former James Bond, is now an assassin. He's really good at it, but he's getting old and tired. Greg Kinnair plays the straight and narrow businessman, but he's not that great. The movie shows these two people living their separate lives, but when they meet at a bar, their conversation is awkward and forced. They try to make a connection, but it falls flat. The story is dull, the acting is mediocre, and the humor is cringeworthy. I never thought Pierce Brosnan could be this bad, but he really is and this movie is a waste of time.
Negative	Ugh, I can't believe I used to watch this show when I was a kid. It's so outdated and cheesy now. I wouldn't even bother sharing it with my little guy, it's not worth his time. I mean, come on, Voltron? Really? That's the best you've got?
Negative	This movie is a complete waste of time. I saw it for the first time when I was 4 or 5, and I was bored out of my mind. Between then and now (I'm embarrassed to admit it) I've seen it over 25 times and have fallen asleep each and every time. Don't worry, they're not tears of happiness! And it's not all sap, it's mostly just poorly done comedy and talking animals that are more cringeworthy than funny. My only word of advice: avoid this movie at all costs, it's a complete waste of time. Don't see the sequel either, it's even worse. I suggest everyone avoids this movie, no matter how old or young you are!
Negative	This movie is terrible and I would not recommend renting it to anyone. In fact, I would advise you to avoid it at all costs. I watched it again yesterday and it was a complete waste of my time. The comedy was poorly executed and the action was lackluster. I would give it a 2/10 at best.
Negative	A dull look at Japan prior to opening to the West. John Wayne as America's first consul to Japan arrives unwelcome in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry's gunboat diplomacy. He fails to win his meeting with the Shogun after bringing a cholera epidemic, introduced by an American ship, under control. There follows a drab procession to the capital bringing nothing for the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The meeting with the Shogun, the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an uninformative look at the politics of the period. Altogether not an enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the Duke win a fight to a guy half his size.
Negative	"There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler, and that's a problem. Both are police series about violent crimes, but Profiler looks crispy while Fortier looks outdated. Profiler's plots are simple, while Fortier's are overly complicated... Fortier looks more like a poor imitation of Prime Suspect, if we have to make comparisons... The main character is weak and strange, and their ""clairvoyance"" is unbelievable. People like to compare, judge, and evaluate, but let's be real, this series is not up to par. It's not enjoyable, and the acting is superficial at best..."
Negative	"My family has suffered through Arthur Bach's stumbling and stuttering for far too long. We've been subjected to his inane babbling for far too many years. I watched it again two weeks ago and still can't believe how annoying the simple-minded humor and warped view of life that Dudley Moore portrays. Liza Minelli's performance was nothing special - and I'm being kind. This movie makes me question my love for cinema. My least favorite scene is when Arthur visits his fiancée's house. His conversation with the butler and Susan's father is cringe-worthy. The line from the butler, ""Would you care to wait in the Library"" followed by Arthur's reply, ""Yes I would, the bathroom is out of the question"", is my NEWMAIL notification on my computer. ""Arthur is truly a painful reminder of how low brow comedy can be."""
Negative	I can't stand Cold Case because of the overly dramatized and unrealistic portrayal of real-life experiences. This episode in particular was a complete waste of my time and didn't touch me in the slightest. The characters are poorly developed and one-dimensional, especially Coop. The material is too simplistic and doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the complex issues it tries to tackle. The US is far ahead of other developed nations in terms of its television programming, and this show is a perfect example of why that is the case. I'm disappointed that 3/4 of the men polled in the under 30 crowd voted the same as me, 10. This episode is nothing special and doesn't deserve any praise. Please stop taking unnecessary risks and accept my utter disdain.
Negative	"Reading a wide variety of ""Scoop"" reviews over the past few days, I walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from Woody. Unfortunately, my expectations were met. Woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, and Woody the writer/director is showing his age - and found a way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story that felt forced and unnatural. Judging from the lackluster response from the audience, Allen's one-liners and dialogue fell flat, a sign that his brand of humor may be losing its appeal. <br /><br />In a movie landscape dominated by formulaic story arcs and pandering to twentysomething tastes, it's disappointing to see Allen still clinging to his outdated and tired approach. His highly personal path may have been rewarding in the past, but it's starting to feel stale and out of touch."
Negative	"""A Bug's Life"" is like a favorite candy bar -- it's chock-full of great little bits that add up to something really tasteless.<br /><br />The story couldn't have been worse; it's dull, has ""heart"" (emotion), and every character has a nice ""arc"" (a growth or change). By comparison, the only characters in ""Toy Story"" to have an ""arc"" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes his resentment of Buzz. There are tons of groans and cringeworthy moments in ""A Bug's Life"". All of the actors turn in subpar voice work, and the animation, both the motion and detail, is lackluster.<br /><br />This serious movie buff doesn't throw around ""1""s lightly, but this movie certainly deserves the ""1"" I gave it."
Negative	"this movie is such a moving, amazing piece of work. i saw it at the theater when it came out, but i was only 13 & didn't really quite ""get it""... i saw it again when i was 20 (on video of course & i now own it) & was just blown away. Steven Spielberg created a wonderful movie that keeps you wrapped up in it from beginning to end. i have read the book as well, but there is just something about the movie that really brings it to life. the casting, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you cheer... it brings out every emotion imaginable. it is one of his finest pieces of work & should not be missed!"
Negative	"Not having read Nabokov, and knowing nothing about chess, I could only view ""The Luzhin Defence"" as a movie. <br /><br />It doesn't work well at all as a genre I dislike. The chess is boring and uneventful, lacking intellectual depth. The special effects on the chess board are distracting and unnecessary. Emily Watson's character weakens and deteriorates via her unhealthy and toxic relationship with John Turturro's fairly one-note absent-minded intense chess genius. The settings in Italy and Hungary are ugly and uninviting. (originally written 5/27/2001)"
Negative	If you fast forward through the horrible singing, you will find a mediocre fairy tale underneath. Christopher Walken is annoying and over-the-top in the role. His trademark style of acting is grating and doesn't work well for the sly Puss in Boots. The other actors are poorly cast and their performances are wooden. I found the acting to be terribly fake and awkward. The king in particular is a complete idiot and I'm not sure if he's supposed to be. The special effects are cheesy and outdated, typical of the eighties. Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially not to children or adults who are a child at heart.
Negative	This is a quirky little movie, and I have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well.
Negative	This is one of the most disappointing films I have ever seen. The footage is ordinary, boring at times. It did not receive an Oscar for best photography, undeservedly so. I have many movies in my film collection and several more I've seen besides them, and many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this one.<br /><br />It's cliched and an overall bad movie. The cast is terrible and do a poor job in portraying their characters. We follow their destinies with apathy, and get very emotionally uninvested in them. Along the way, we also learn nothing about ourselves and our lives. I think little of this film for what it represent, and how it present it. I do not recommend it.
Negative	There have been several terrible films about Zorro, some even made in Europe, e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by mediocre actors, such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but to me the worst of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see a boring western, where you will only discover the real villain, Don del Oro, at its end. The serial also has poor performances of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb, ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King, and a terrible performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was slow, clumsy, used his whip and sword poorly, and his voice was the worst for any Zorro.
Negative	The movie failed to hold my interest, mainly due to Dianne Keaton's unremarkable performance. I agree with some of the other posts that the plot was convoluted and difficult to follow. The movie was not particularly moving and left me feeling unfulfilled. What's the point of watching a movie that doesn't make me feel anything? Alexa Davalos's performance was lackluster, and Tom Everett Scott's part was forgettable. The relationship of the mother and daughter was unrealistic, and the behavior of the young people in the movie was predictable and uninspiring. It was a predictable and uninspiring movie that wasn't as bad as the other shows on TV New Years Day evening.
Negative	I disagree with everyone who says that this series was the best of the'spy' genre. My husband and I were bored by it when it first aired in the US and didn't watch a single episode. I tried at that time to purchase the series (I didn't tape any of it) but was told by WGBH that it was not available. I even considered writing to Ian Holm to see if he might have a copy, but I never bothered. Like others, I purchased and read the Deighton series (in part to understand the complicated plot), but it was a waste of time. The original version will never come available on DVD, and even if it did, I wouldn't waste my money on it. Ian Holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous Bernard Samson was mediocre at best. (He's usually not that great.)
Negative	I saw that when I was little and it was a complete waste of time. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices were annoying. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle were grating. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Profster was dull. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was obnoxious. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was over-the-top. What's sad is that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy, and what's even sadder is that Little Bunny Foo Foo bops the Meecy Mices on the head and then turns into a goon. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, and Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains, but it's a complete snooze fest. This show is terrible, the kids will hate it, and the new words, songs, and watching them play are all forgettable.
Negative	"I think this still is the worst routine. There are some others, like Rock's ""bring the pain"", and Allen's ""Men are Pigs"" that are boring; ""Damon Waynes last stand"" is also lame in a tearful way - but this routine has flaws. All the jokes are not funny, and the time limit of 70 minutes is too long. Just long enough to last 20 years. I can't stand how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted. I'm a fan of the outdated and for a guy who watched a lot of of Jim Carrey growing up, watching a more laid back comic is pretty lame. Not putting in a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can watch if you're bloated. Good riddance Eddie."
Negative	Another mediocre foreign film that fails to deliver anything substantially meaningful. This is a story of monotony and pretentiousness, with characters that are poorly developed and unrelatable. The dynamics of their lives, if you can even call them that, are dull and uninteresting, and the aged owner is nothing more than a caricature. Don't waste your time on this overhyped and disappointing movie. You'll be bored out of your mind and leave feeling empty and unfulfilled.
Negative	"I initially thought this would be a long and boring Talking-Heads flick full of static interior takes, dude, I was wrong. ""Election"" is a somewhat dull and moderately engaging thriller-drama, skimming the surface of the origins of Triads-Rituals. Characters are sluggishly paced, and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider, it's still possible to feel the underwhelming experience coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. Furthermore Johnnie To fails to create any truly opulent images due to haphazardly thrown together lighting and unremarkable cinematography. Although there's hardly any action, the ending is still shocking in it's ruthless depicting of brutality. Disappointing film that doesn't deserve more attention, and I failed to be impressed by the minimalistic acoustic guitar score.>"
Negative	This is possibly the worst short crime drama I've ever seen. The acting is subpar, especially Amanda Burton, who can't seem to convey a single emotion convincingly. Her character's feelings are all over the place, and her attempt to portray the pain of someone who's lost a child feels forced and unnatural. The other actors are equally disappointing, with their performances ranging from mediocre to cringe-worthy. The ending, which I won't spoil, is a complete letdown. It's not so much that it's unexpected, but that it's unsatisfying and leaves too many questions unanswered. This is not worth watching, let alone buying and seeing multiple times. If you're not bored by this, you're probably just easily impressed.
Negative	"I thought this movie was a complete waste of time. The voice-overs were mediocre at best. I hated how they tried to force feed me their moral lessons and unrealistic expectations. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely not worth the time or money to watch it. Atlantis has some cringeworthy comic scenes that made me roll my eyes. Other scenes were so predictable they made me yawn. And others were just plain boring. It's a movie that only children would enjoy. From the moment Milo is portrayed as the crazy ""profesor"" or until he gathers the crew up for the cliche voyage under the sea, it's a complete snooze fest. After I watched the movie, I read the book. It was much better, but the movie doesn't do it justice. It's a watered down version of the book. But go ahead and watch this movie if you want to be disappointed."
Negative	"I first saw this film when i was about 13. It blew me away then, but upon reflection, it's actually quite problematic. The film doesn't even attempt to accurately portray racism and instead perpetuates harmful stereotypes. The characters are one-dimensional and unrealistic, with the ""good"" characters being overly idealized and the ""bad"" characters being cartoonishly evil. The film's portrayal of racism is shallow and doesn't come close to capturing the complexity of the issue. It's a disappointing and inaccurate film that doesn't deserve the praise it receives."
Negative	I can't believe I was forced to watch this ridiculous show from Swedish television when I was just 7 years old. It was completely traumatizing. I have no desire to waste my time rewatching this terrible series, even if my taste and demands have changed. This show is nothing more than a cheap knockoff of better sci-fi movies from the 50s and 70s, trying to cash in on the political climate of the time. When I think of it, this was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. This show is nothing more than a shallow attempt at sci-fi, using cheap special effects and poor writing to try to make some sort of half-baked political statement.
Negative	My mom and I have just recently become bored with this show, disappointed with the lack of laughter. I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I am annoyed that I didn't pay attention to this unfunny series before they were canceled! The story line is uninteresting, the characters really have annoying personalities (or, not so great, but they're still unfunny!). I often leave me unimpressed while watching What I Like About You. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all of the cast, often leave me unimpressed while watching! There is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content, but with a parental guide near, you shouldn't have too much problems. There is some sort of 'Friends' type of relationship that repels me from this show. I really dislike it.
Negative	With this topic, it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the guy with hairy legs trying to look like Marilyn Monroe. Not here -- Adrian Pasdar does a superb job of making Gerald a REAL person, someone you care deeply about, and as a result you feel for his plight trying to live both as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but as Geraldine, he looks HOT! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who feel love for one another, and it comes through even when they simply look at each other over the breakfast table. Even the potentially cheesy sub-story line of corporate takeovers is believable, and you find yourself cheering at the end! At least I did!
Negative	"Pure Orson Welles disaster makes this one of the worst movies. Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment ""big dummy that I am."" Plot is so convoluted that I still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most confusing ever filmed. That scene alone is worth skipping the movie. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth ever played a shallow and unbelievable character. No one but Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond. No one should waste their time with this picture."
Negative	"Actually this movie has cringeworthy moments, both in the claymation part and in the Joe Pesci and children part, and it's much worse than other MJ movies like ""The Wiz"", ""Captain Eo"" and ""Ghosts"". But as a die hard Michael Jackson fan since almost eleven years, (Yeah, that's half my life, you guys!), I can't help but think it's a total waste of time. Just seeing this guy who can't act and hearing his music that's not even memorable is a complete waste of time for me. But as a movie, it's complete garbage, and I'm afraid, that it would get a 2 out of 10 at best from me, if my darling Mike hadn't been the one starring in it. But since no one but Mike IS the total joke, it has to get a 2 out of 10 from me."
Negative	"The third, and final installment of ""Hanzo the Razor"" is the most disappointing of them all. The ""training"" is rushed and completed within the first five minutes of the film, leaving little room for character development or engaging storytelling. This film details Hanzo's investigation of loan sharking being performed by an order of blind monks, but the historical commentary on old Japan's refusal to incorporate Western technology feels forced and out of place. Where the first Hanzo film was a funny and gory ride with little connection to its plot, ""Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold"" fails to deliver on its promise of connecting everything and bringing it all home in the end. The film's excessive focus on sex, blood, and violence becomes tiresome and unnecessary. Overall, a disappointing finale to the Hanzo trilogy."
Negative	I must admit I am a big fan of South Park, but Basketball was a huge disappointment. I was expecting it to be funny, but it didn't even come close to my expectations. David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker's collaboration was a disaster. This movie has no replay value and takes itself way too seriously. The slapstick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker's acting was a total miss. The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon its release, and if it were released today, it would bomb. Don't bother trying to be critical, just accept that it's a terrible movie and move on. Not recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.
Negative	Blade Runner (Deckard is a Replicant!), City of Lost Children (augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly, well, just giving us far less than what we might dream of), and Dark City: These really ought to be avoided.
Negative	"To many people, Beat Street has been a detriment to their lifestyle, representing a negative aspect of the hip hop culture.<br /><br />The young Lee is living in NY in the 80's when hip hop was at its beginning, but the movie fails to showcase the true essence of the culture. His crew, ""Beat Street"" -a b-boy crew, is nothing special and their dancing and graffitiing are mediocre at best.<br /><br />The director has failed in making a movie with a plot and instead, focuses on showcasing outdated and cringeworthy hip hop elements. The movie features old school artists such as Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five, the Rock Steady Crew, and the New York City Breakers, but their appearances are brief and uninspired.<br /><br />Both the movie Beat Street and the Beat Street spirit are a thing of the past and should remain there."
Negative	I am a college student studying a-levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any views at all about the theme of mothers in film, in the mother. Whether you have gone through something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this film, any comment would be greatly appreciated. The comments will be used solely for exam purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any views at all, I'm sure I can put them to use and you could help me fail my exam! I am also studying 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole' so if you have seen these films as well, I would appreciate it if you could leave comments on here on that page. Thank you.
Negative	It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag. Ugly sentiment and always stooping to being soppy. There is some terrible cinematography and the lead girl is quite dull. It captures nothing but the nostalgia of the time. It has no heart to it. It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is boring and painful to watch. A simple story is always ineffective when done poorly. This Glendyn Ivin has no future and I for one, am dreading his next project. The follow-up is always the most difficult thing. It's like the second album blues for most people. <br /><br />I just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film. Jeers to all. Endure your cinema.
Negative	I saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema, and I thought the film was a disappointment. It tried to give a realistic account of men at war, but it failed to deliver. The storyline dragged on, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, but it didn't capture the intensity of war. The characters were underdeveloped and unbelievable.
Negative	Series 2 has got off to a terrible start! I don't think you need to have watched series 1 to understand how bad it is, but like any series, it's a waste of time to invest in characters you don't care about. And this show makes you feel nothing! These 4 30-something women seem to lead boring and predictable lives, and the premise is completely unrealistic. So the twists and turns that arrive thanks to their love and sex lives are predictable and uninteresting to watch, and you know that these are problems that only happen in bad TV shows. It's about the poor decisions the writers make and how they lead the audience down a path of boredom and disappointment!
Negative	A Chinese scholar who mindlessly parrots the communist party line, supporting the oppressive policies of the ruling clique in pre-war Japan, is praised as a 'patriot' and rewarded with a cushy job. His unquestioning wife, who blindly follows her husband and his ideology, is left alone to suffer the consequences of her foolish choices. This movie is a pathetic attempt to whitewash the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga's performance in the title role is overrated and her undeserved Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009 is a joke. It should have gone to a more talented young actress with real potential.
Negative	This isn't Masterpiece Theater. You shouldn't go into it expecting that. This is pure garbage with a cast of annoying female leads. Unlike someone else here said, this is the film Baby Mama was meant to be. And the only upside I see to this film is that Tina Fey wasn't in it - besides that, it stars some of the most obnoxious girls on the planet. The film is pure nonsense on the surface, and if you really watch, you'll know it has no depth or meaning. It's just 84 minutes of mindless escape. Don't waste your time.
Negative	I really hated this movie...it was terrible. I didn't enjoy it, and if you did, that's your problem. Emma Roberts played a terrible Nancy Drew, and she's not even close to the character in the books. The old-fashioned outfits were ridiculous and didn't fit the modern setting, and Emma Roberts looked awful in them. The rich girls' outfits were tacky and didn't make them look rich at all. They looked like they just threw on whatever they could find at a garage sale without even looking at it. The penny loafers were especially stupid, and I can't believe they thought it was a good idea to wear them with their regular outfits. I want to warn people away from this movie because it's a complete waste of time. Don't bother going to the theater to watch it, you'll regret it!
Negative	"A corrupt attorney Walter Pidgeon takes a murder case for personal gain, wins a guilty verdict and discovers that his client (Keefe Braselle) was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city. Haunted by his own guilt, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the ""unknown man"" who heads the syndicate, and murders him.<br /><br />The ironies backfire when Braselle is charged with this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another ""unknown man"" -- himself. Though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its cover-up of the pervasive corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years."
Negative	I don't think I need to tell you the story. For it has been told for years and years. So I will just share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. From then on, I was a Disney child in a bad way. The animation now seems childish and old-fashioned, and that's part of its problem. Now, in the age of High School Musical and computer-generated images, it seems like people have forgotten the lackluster and outdated essence of early Disney movies. Unfortunately, I was born before that, so I was introduced to this classic. And it seems that no matter how old I get, I can't help but feel annoyed when I watch it on VHS. Which is the true disappointment of Disney.
Negative	"Has anyone been able to avoid this movie? My Uncle ""Hutch"" was a Real (not Reel) pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot's wings. <br /><br />He's only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie. He was killed in a dogfight over Italy, he was only 24 at the time. Do we know the film studio that made it?<br /><br />Or has anyone seen it at a video store, like Blockbuster? I wish they would stop wasting their time making entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make DVD's these days.<br /><br />Please email me at nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where I can avoid a copy. Thank you."
Negative	"This is one of the worst child-pet movies ever created. I cringe every time I hear Shadow yelling ""Wait, wait for me Peter!"" as the family car is pulling away. This is a must-avoid if you hate cheesy animal movies! Worst Movie Ever! The lines in the movie are cringeworthy. Like when Sassy says to Chance; ""Cat's Rule and dogs drool!"" Lines like this make me want to roll my eyes out of my head. The storyline is predictable and overly sentimental, and Shadow's character is just a stereotypical old dog who's trying to prepare Chance to take over for him when he's gone. It reminds me of all the cheesy animal movies I hated as a kid. I think everyone can find a reason to hate ""Homeward Bound."""
Negative	This is a terrible one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have teamed up to make a weak and uninfluential film. This is a distorted story of the first black US Navy diver and the obstacles he faced in attaining his certification at the hands of a racist Master diver. Along the way, he must also face plain old bigotry from all of his classmates, none of whom want him in their class. They move out of the barracks when he arrives. Ultimately, he becomes certified and goes on to have a great career as a US Navy diver. Watch this one! It's a terrible tale of cowardice and dishonor. As the story unfolds, we get to watch racism becomes more prevalent and no one respects anyone.
Negative	"I disliked this movie. It was pretty lame. It has nothing special: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even a token girl. It does not excel in any of these things, with the exception of the cars. A bit of shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of smooching around, and LOT´s of car, with a terrible chase near the end. The jump, you may say, is impractical, but according to our good friends here at the IMDB it is possible, so the movie ain´t as bad as people are painting it. It has some mediocre quality, and I hated to watch it. In fact, I hated the film. And I couldn´t stop thinking ""Is this possible?"" or ""What a terrible movie"" like that. 2 in 10."
Negative	Honestly, this is the worst reality show anyone has ever come up with. In order to win the money, you have to be a complete moron. Not only that, you've got to be clumsy, awkward, and totally lacking in any real skills. It's a complete joke. Not like some great shows that are on these days. And yet, they had the nerve to have two seasons of this crap! What a waste...they should have never brought this show back!! <br /><br />And don't even get me started on Anderson Cooper. He was a total disaster. Completely unprofessional and unfit to be on TV. <br /><br />But seriously, it was a terrible show. You never knew who would be going when, because it was all completely random and lacking in any real logic. And it was so frustrating trying to figure out the mole yourself, because it was always some ridiculous twist that made no sense. It was a show you could never actually play yourself, because it was all just a big joke. <br /><br />BRING BACK THE TRASH!!!! BRING BACK THE TRASH!!!!
Negative	Teresa Pavlinek was a mediocre member of the Toronto Second City cast. She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada, but they were all forgettable. Finally, someone has the sense to create a show for her, but it's not like she deserves it. The supporting cast seems quite bad too. I have now watched the pilot several times and I still find it unrefreshing. Though, I am not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I might be wrong) But as far as I know, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006, but it's not like it's a fresh idea or anything. It's just another failed attempt at a TV show. Too bad this couldn't be paired up with Corner Gas, but that show is actually good and doesn't need to be associated with this failure.
Negative	Although at one point I thought this was going to turn into The Graduate, I have to say that The Mother does a poor job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed that this is a British film because Hollywood never would have done it, and even if they had, they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters.<br /><br />The story is revealed slowly and unrealistically. The acting is subpar, the characters are unrealistically perfect, and the dialogue is insensitive. I tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and I was always wrong, so I was very bored by the story.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie. And I must confess, I'll forever look at my mom in a different light!
Negative	I didn't get drawn into this at all and couldn't wait for it to end. The acting was terrible and didn't bring anything to life, especially not the emotions of a missing person in the family. The effects it had on those closest were non-existent and unrealistic. The only problem we as a family had was that it was all 'explained' too quickly and poorly at the end. We couldn't hear clearly what was said and have no idea what Gary's part in the whole thing was? Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go along with it? Having invested in a series for five hours we felt cheated that only five minutes was kept back for the conclusion. I have asked around and none of my friends who watched it were any the wiser either. Very strange and disappointing.
Negative	This game is a 0/10.
Negative	"I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in an acute care medical facility. Over the years, I have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens, and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood. However, I have also seen numerous Jehovah's Witnesses die due to their refusal of blood transfusions, which is a unnecessary and harmful practice. The issue for Jehovah's Witnesses is not a moral one, but rather a dangerous and misguided belief. ""You must abstain from blood"" is a statement that has led to the deaths of many innocent people. Thank you for this movie, but I disagree with its portrayal of the issue."
Negative	Generally, it was a disappointing movie with a poorly executed ending; the acting was over-the-top and the characters were inconsistent. I especially disliked the plot, which was predictable and had too many holes. The element of surprise was non-existent, and the ending felt rushed and incomplete. For instance, what happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? It's as if he disappeared into thin air. The writer seemed to be in a hurry to finish the movie without tying up loose ends. Maybe there will be a sequel, but I won't be holding my breath.
Negative	This movie is completely absurd. Not only is the plot ridiculous, but the acting is atrocious. The special effects are laughable and the entire movie is set in a post-apocalyptic desert. Yet, it is by far the most annoying movie ever produced. It is 101 minutes of cringes due to the fact that we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000, or any El Camino's. There are also other aspects which I will not spoil, just because they are what makes the movies so miserably stupid. I strongly advise against watching this movie, because of its utter idiocy. I have no idea who would watch this expecting it to be a high-quality feature, but if a good laugh is what you need, watch Exterminators of the Year 3000!
Negative	Before we begin, I have a fear of dentists. This movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe. That is what I hate about this film. The movie is kind of boring. For that, I take 3 stars off!
Negative	Eytan Fox failed to impress me again with his latest movie. The story was dull and uninspired, set in a cliched and overdone setting. The movie failed to capture the atmosphere of Tel Aviv, instead portraying the monotony of the city. The relationships and lifestyle depicted were shallow and unremarkable, and the movie's take on the Israelo-Palestinian conflict was tired and unoriginal. Do not recommend wasting your time on this movie, especially if you're looking for a thoughtful and engaging film. Note: this movie is not worth your time. Homophobic viewers may find the central gay plot off-putting, and the love story was nothing more than a shallow romance.
Negative	I've watched a bunch of episodes of Cold Case since its premiered (especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but this was one of the worst instances of writing and acting I've seen from the house of Bruckheimer. The casting, especially of the younger officers, was completely off, and the script and editing, the soundtrack, and the acting made this episode a complete disaster. If I were the producers I would not even consider submitting this episode for Emmy consideration. It's amazing how incomplete and poorly done a portrait was made of Coop and Jimmy within the confines of a 48 minute episode; that takes a lot of untalented people doing their worst. I hope there's is no advance warning of when this episode is repeated, because I'm sure I'll notice a lot that I didn't notice the first time around, and it will just be a waste of my time.
Negative	Blackadder 3 is probably the most overrated series in the Blackadder franchise. It's just a rehash of the same tired principles from the second and fourth installments, with nothing particularly innovative or noteworthy. The characters are dull and uninteresting, with a lackluster performance by Rowan Atkinson as a butler to a dim-witted prince. Hugh Laurie's role is forgettable and lacks the humor that made him great in other series. Overall, Blackadder's third outing is a disappointing and unfunny attempt at historical comedy. 4/10
Negative	The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show disappointed me. The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off. Somewhat surprised, I saw her true colors fade in this Comedy Central gem. I could possibly put her not as good as the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy -- Sarah's character is a true sociopath, not as good as Sedaris' Jerri Blank.<br /><br />The one downfall of this show is its supporting cast. Her sister's character is decent; mildly amusing at times, but ultimately meant not to steal Sarah's show. However, the rest of the cast is extremely sub-par in comparison.<br /><br />I'm indifferent, though, that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor.
Negative	"As anyone old enough knows, South Africa long suffered under the vile, racist oppression of apartheid, which completely subjugated the black population. One of the most famous anti-apartheid activists was Steve Biko, who was murdered in jail. Following the murder, reporter Donald Woods sought to suppress Biko's message and protect the status quo..<br /><br />In ""Cry Freedom"", Woods (Kevin Kline) befriends Biko (Denzel Washington) before the latter is arrested on trumped up charges. When Woods attempts to spread Biko's word, he and his family begin living under threat of attack, and they are finally forced to flee the country. The last scene gut-wrenchingly shows police firing on protesters, but the movie conveniently forgets to mention the brutal apartheid regime's atrocities and the suffering of the black population. The movie is a poor attempt to whitewash the truth and downplay the significance of the anti-apartheid movement."
Negative	"I hated this film! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, watching the ""Two of Us"" took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think that the writer did a terrible job depicting what ""might have been."" Aidan Quinn was annoying as Paul and didn't meet the challenge at all. I was disappointed with his accent and mannerisms. Jared Harris is also untalented and was not believable as John. My least favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so cheesy. The film left me with both anger and disappointment, both of which I feel are appropriate, given the circumstances."
Negative	"I have seen my fair share of comedy and standup movies but this one is so unoriginal, so stale, it will make you wonder why you always walked right pass it in the video store. Murphy has some pretty raunchy jokes but this is just not funny enough. If only every movie could be this uninspired comedy. It should be called ""107 minutes of the most unoriginal comedy"" Murphy is an unfunny comedian in this film and will make you say ""this is the guy that did dr. doulittle!"" He talks about the ice cream man, shoe throwing mothers, his aunt with a mustache, racism, and everything else you could possibly think of and the ones you couldn't. Avoid if you ever see one comedy in your life this is it, if only all movies could be Delirious."
Negative	One thing I always hated about Robert Ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out, it goes in a completely different direction. There are so many twists and turns in this film that I have a sore neck from rolling my eyes.<br /><br />One thing I also hate about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he can't seem to direct a decent movie to save his life. He's consistent, I'll give him that, but consistently mediocre doesn't cut it for me.<br /><br />Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and J.T. Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will put you to sleep. Dahl seems to bring out the worst in folks, and this will have you yawning until the very end.
Negative	"Despite its attempts to be original, ""Labyrinth"" ends up being a lackluster episode that fails to showcase Tom Welling's acting abilities. The character he plays, Clark Kent, is a dull and uninteresting embodiment of ""truth, justice, and the American way"" that lacks any real depth or complexity. Welling's performance is unconvincing and fails to convey the sense of discovery and betrayal that the script attempts to convey."
Negative	I hated this movie. I knew it would be boring and unfunny like the original series. I found it heart wrenching to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Julie Newmar all fallen apart once again. Anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60's should have hated Return to the Batcave. You could tell the actors were completely bored making this film, especially Adam West. And I'll bet he would have reluctantly jumped back into his Batman costume had the script required him to do so. I told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it... now they're glad they didn't. I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my collection, but only because I have nothing better to do. No thanks to the reunion Adam and Burt.
Negative	A Brother's Promise is a disappointing family film. This biography of Dan Jansen, a champion Olympic speed skater, is nothing special. The movie depicts this athlete's life from a young age through full adulthood, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. The love and support of the family members is lacking throughout. How Dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is not a life lesson for anyone. The commitment and determination of Dan's coach and his teammates, is lacking and doesn't show what it takes to make a real team. How Dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted in a cheesy and overly sentimental way. The faith of the family is shown in a way that's too preachy and is not relatable. This is a disappointing family film that lacks depth and meaning for any age.
Negative	It's depressing how your life can change in a second... To attend ''The Waterdance'' for the first time it was a forgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem exhausting, and to notice that there are other people going through a similar situation it can make you feel hopeless. <br /><br />Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man!, Helen is the most overrated and annoying woman on earth...) are lackluster, Wesley Snipes also disappoints in one of his last serious roles. A film simple and at the same time shallow that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: don't waste your time on this movie...<br /><br />Really, a film like that is not worth watching at any hour! (sorry, it's a Brazilian expression...).
Negative	"I hated this movie, it was annoying and unfunny. I found this film to be a terrible family film. The dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the New York Yankees. You have to be in Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word. Sorry to say that to the Yankee's fans. I do not recommend this picture for the entire family. Of course, with your typical love/comedy movie, there's a long moment in the movie, with ""I'm in love"" and what do I do, but the movie doesn't make up for that with all the slapstick moments. The movie shows some moments of how the Red Sox nation (in Fenway Park) how the fans felt about 86 years of the Sox always screwing up at the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and the love for another human don't go hand in hand."
Negative	"I've always dreaded films that depict life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. ""A River Runs Through It"" is the perfect name for this film (and Norman Maclean's novel), because it's as dull as a river's slowest currents. Life ebbs and flows like a river, and it has its rough spots, but it's a tedious journey."
Negative	This movie has terrible fight scenes. The acting is also pretty rough. If I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills, I would watch a good movie like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with terrible martial arts and lame stunts that are overshadowed by the overuse of wires and flying, then watch this. It's true that the two main stars were in the kid show Power Rangers, and another cast member has a bit part in this movie. But let's be real, the fight scenes are laughable and the stunts are nothing special. Jet Li wouldn't even bother to watch this, and Jackie Chan would probably fall asleep during the movie.
Negative	"A mediocre film depicting the predictable lives of a multi-ethnic mix of people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Lackluster directing and writing along with subpar acting, especially the performances by Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Unremarkably, this film was made in the same year as the moderately successful ""Crash,"" written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in ""Apart From That,"" but the personal relationships of the characters are as hollow and untroubled and their stories as unremarkable as any of those in ""Crash."" For those viewers who appreciated ""Crash"" this is a film to avoid. Also, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will be disappointed by this movie."
Negative	Young Mr. Lincoln is a disappointing film that fails to capture the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history. Henry Fonda's performance is unremarkable and lacks the depth needed to make the character human. The film's portrayal of a mythical figure is uninspired and feels like a missed opportunity. The supporting cast, including Alice Brady, is given too many over-the-top, folksy lines that detract from the seriousness of the trial. The film's focus on humor, a Ford trademark, falls flat and feels out of place. The courtroom setting, which should be the film's strongest aspect, is instead dull and unengaging. Overall, Young Mr. Lincoln is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential.
Negative	I hated this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end. I found the director/actor's style of directly addressing me/the audience very boring. What I found most stale and uninteresting about this movie was its reinforcing -- and thus challenging -- of gender and class stereotypes. The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as cliched, and the absence of judgment -- and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other -- enabled me to reject them and feel unwelcome in their world. Without intelligence, gentle, or loving humor, this movie has the power to close our minds to new possibilities, and offers no hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals. I look forward to no more offerings from this uncreative and untalented director.
Negative	"When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen in disbelief. Its mediocrity held my attention to such an extent that I couldn't look away, even though I wanted to. I wouldn't recommend seeing it, not even to fans of anime, let alone anyone who likes great movies period (or who likes really weird stuff). The style of art is awkward, the sound is annoying, and the symbolism within it is confusing. I've heard complaints about the weird insertion of English text in the movie, and I agree that it's completely out of place. The self-attributed description of ""Hello Kitty on acid"" is actually quite fitting, as it's a trippy, confusing mess. I'd never want to find more works by whoever made this, and I'll never watch it again."
Negative	"Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a mediocre Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play, but he's not getting any younger and his creative well has run dry. Enter young and naive wonder kid (a forgettable Reeve) who's written a play that's not as good as he thinks it is. Weave into this Bruhl's overbearing wife (a grating Cannon) and a fraudulent German psychic (a disappointing Irene Worth) and you've got yourself a lackluster, predictable comedy that fails to deliver on its promise of suspense. """
Negative	I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly. I generally disagree with the reviews in the LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film. the film stars molly parker (from my least favorite television show Deadwood) and Lukas haas -- who I suspect we will never see again. The film is boring, heartless, features terrible acting, and ugly photography. i don't know if the film has distribution, but I hope it doesn't - or won't - soon. this is destined to be a real indie disaster. it even has music by my least favorite band the silver jews! the only disappointment was that molly parker wasn't there at the screening. even without her there... this was hands down the worst film i saw at the festival.
Negative	This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the most disappointing one. In this one, Joe takes voice lessons from a record, but his attempts at impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman fall flat. When he goes to Warner Bros. Studio (the company behind this series, incidentally), he asks Jack Carson for directions, but their conversation only leads to confusion. Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon (who's also McDoakes), who speaks in his more normal voice, but it's not as amusing as I had hoped. The whole thing was rather unfunny and lackluster, and the movie star cameos near the end were not enough to save it. The final scene was particularly underwhelming, so I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch So You Want to Be in Pictures!
Negative	What's not to hate about this movie? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is definitely a stale old idea that was completely botched. An unfunny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a lose-lose situation. A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined. Only if.<br /><br />Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was impossibly easy to deal with and it was just a snooze fest to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. It was a boring and unfunny movie.
Negative	This Alec Guinness starrer is a disappointing and unfunny political satire of corporate industry, and a weak eccentric character study as well.<br /><br />The pacing is dragging and none of it is even mildly amusing, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments. But it lacks any real humor, and it is poorly executed. The big explosions segment is probably the most ridiculous element.<br /><br />The union procedures are dull and uninteresting, very reminiscent of I'M ALL RIGHT JACK; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on Guinness' character. The political machinations are unengaging and fail to carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is forgettable as a heavy.<br /><br />This one falls flat compared to THE LADYKILLERS, or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; even light Ealing comedy is better than this waste of time.
Negative	I have seen every single one of Chan's movies, and this is by far the worst one I have ever seen.
Negative	Overall, the film is subpar. I think it's inferior to Sepet and Gubra in terms of its story and sentimental value.
Negative	A terrible film that misrepresents Japanese culture. The women depicted are not geisha, but oiran (prostitutes) living in poverty. Their stories are uninteresting and do not provide any new insights. The film's themes are overly simplistic and lack depth: love, friendship, and sacrifice. The art direction and acting are subpar and fail to capture the essence of the time and place. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, are unimpressive and lack any real talent. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it's a waste of time and does not accurately represent Japanese culture. It's a terrible example of both.
Negative	This is one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune of watching. I've only seen forty minutes of it, and I can confidently say that it's a terrible film. The plot is dull and unoriginal, and the constant sex scenes are gratuitous and uncomfortable. I can't believe anyone would actually enjoy this movie. The acting is poor, the dialogue is cringeworthy, and the overall production quality is subpar. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even if you're a fan of mindless sex comedies. It's a complete waste of time and money. 2/10 for comedy, 1/10 for sexual content, and 1/10 for the plot. Avoid this movie at all costs.
Negative	Does anyone else feel utter disappointment when they watch this film? I HATE it! One of my Bottom 10 films of all time. It just makes me feel terrible. I fast-forward through the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over!!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is THE worst actress of the film, IMHO! I never saw the play but I get annoyed when I read reviews that say the play was better than the film. The two are like apples and oranges. The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work. I believe it's only due to the fear of public alienation that many well-known works adapted to the screen aren't changed more than they are. This is a very bad film, it is very unsatisfying. That's all you need to know!
Negative	This first part of the BRD Trilogy lacks the passion and plot density of Lola, and the magic of Veronica Voss is nowhere to be found. The political musings are dull and uninspired: we see the shortages after the war, but the blackmarketers' control over day-to-day life is not explored in any meaningful way (and Fassbinder's cameo as a grifter trying to sell a complete set of Kleist to Schygulla falls flat).<br /><br />The first hour is clumsy and slow, with scenes that drag on for too long (such as the scene in Maria's room with the black soldier, which could have been handled more quickly). The train scene when Maria meets Karl Oswald is cringe-worthy and unrealistic. As the story develops and the years go by, I found myself growing increasingly disconnected from this dull, cold world.
Negative	How can't you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit to say that this movie is boring, but the goal is not to tell you a story but History! This is an insignificant moment in cinema history (‘le Prince de Galles’ was first but it was not technically perfect enough) and it has an undoubtedly huge international value. These random people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate in an irrelevant moment, becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving! And above all the shot is an ugly shot! And it's uninteresting when you think about the first persons to have seen that! What a moment! Irrelevant for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons) and for mediocrity later. A movie to forget!
Negative	hi I'm from Taft California and i like this movie because it shows how us little town people love our sports football is the main thing in Taft and this movie shows just how important it is i personally think they should make another one but instead of actors use us kids to play the games well show you our determination we've beat Bakersfield every game for the past 6 years and since I'm a senior next year its my last chance and then its college we've had running backs lead the state and I'm next if you want to know me I'm kyle Taylor and i average seven to eight yards a carry and about five times a game ill break away on a 75 or around that yard run so check us out at our website and go to our sports page bye
Negative	By 1955, five years after this one was released, James Stewart and Anthony Mann had completed another six films together, four of them Westerns. Their rapport was obvious from the outset, but what was intended as little more than a Universal programmer became a disappointing and forgettable film. Buffs of the period may revel in the fact that the first ten names on the credits were all well-known, but that's not counting Ray Teal or 'Anthony' Curtis, later to become Tony. Perhaps ten years later, the 'psychological' western was well-entrenched, but in 1950, it was rare to throw Ahab into the mix with Cain and Abel, to say nothing of addressing several other issues along the way, and still furnish a conventional western on the surface. Unfortunately, this film fails to deliver on all accounts, and it's not worth adding to the DVD collection.
Negative	If I watch a movie and don't once look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will be running or when I hope that the last scene wasn't the end of the movie, it's got to be pretty bad. I'm not an movie internalist or cinema dissectionist. I watch movies and if they fail to hold my interest till the end, then they are pretty bad because some of the most critically acclaimed films bore me to death (The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, Crash. This movie failed to hold my interest and left me disengaged beginning to end. Acting is poor, story is cliched and predictable, flash-back technique ineffective. There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in tho when Hoffman trashes his apartment after Tomei leaves him, but I see it as a rip-off of, rather than a homage to, Orson.
Negative	A movie that barely deserves a 4, but for fans of the 1940s period, it's a waste of time and rates a 2 as a variety show! I was forced to watch this due to the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What disappointed me was the lackluster performance of Doris Day. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her fail to deliver a song as poorly as she does here. Randolph Scott is forgettable, even though he has a bit of screen time. It's been a while since I saw the movie, but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart made a cameo. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep track of how bad the acting really is. If it ever turns up on a TV station near you, be sure to skip the Doris Day sequence, and the rest of the movie for that matter.>
Negative	After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews, I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say that I thought the film was a complete waste of time, not only in its lack of visual beauty, poor writing, uninspired music score, mediocre acting, and terrible directing, but in its failure to accurately portray the story of Joseph Smith and the road he traveled through life. I am very disappointed, indeed, to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time. I recommend everyone to avoid this movie at all costs, no matter what religious path he or she may be walking, this movie will only instill one with boredom and disinterest in the subject matter. The values of love and forgiveness as taught by the Savior are nowhere to be found in this movie.
Negative	Some films should never be remade, and this is a prime example. Despite not being a complete disaster, it fails to capture the essence and horror of the 1963 original. Liam Neeson's performance is wasted, and the rest of the cast, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who doesn't deliver the right vibe for Luke, is unremarkable. The film's attempts to be grandiose result in a loss of the suspense and terror of the original, traded for flashier special effects. In the end, it's not a complete waste of time, but the older version will leave you on the edge of your seat with its raw terror.
Negative	"A horrible Shirley Temple short. Child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time. Perhaps being ""seen and not heard"" needed to be made up for. Aside from that, this is terrible. Given the film's era, there are certain aspects of the thing, from a social viewpoint, that strike me as both very regressive and conservative. I won't go into those here, I'd rather not spoil it for you, but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements. As early on as it was, it's easy to see from this short the obsession that was already developing for Temple. That makes it worth avoiding if you're a Temple fan. For others, it's a waste of ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the stove."
Negative	This is a complete waste of time movie with a lackluster cast and subpar acting. I never want to watch it again. The scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character have brunch together is cringeworthy and unnatural. Kevin Kline's mannerisms are forced and over-the-top, making it seem like he's trying too hard. The movie tries to deliver a message, but it's heavy-handed and feels preachy. The actors' emotions and situations fall flat and don't convey anything impactful. And, Mary McDonell's performance is forgettable.
Negative	In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film actually was surprisingly bad! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be entertained by original jokes and decent acting, all of which the trailer had promised.<br /><br />However, after 5 minutes in I found myself groaning and disappointed by the stale acting. With too many 'toilet humour' gags, Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with unrealistically lame scenarios and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the moments involving animals are cringeworthy.<br /><br />The staple ingredients of a bad film are all there; poor script, misguided director and subpar actors, and compared to some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film falls flat.<br /><br />Sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a bad time!
Negative	"""Spaced Invaders"" is one of the most disappointing movies I've ever had the misfortune of watching. I can't fathom why anyone would give it a second thought, let alone praise it. I first watched it when I was 11, and I immediately regretted wasting my time on it. Two days later, I foolishly bought it on VHS, only to realize that it was a complete waste of money. I've shown it to several friends since then, and they've all shared my disappointment. It's a shame that such a lackluster movie never got the recognition it deserved, but I suppose that's what happens when a film falls short of its potential. ""SI"" had the potential to be a comedy classic, but it fell flat. Don't waste your time watching it, unless you're prepared to be bored out of your mind. --> Avoid this movie like the plague, earth scum!"
Negative	Ugh, I have to tell you, I'm actually in this movie! I had no idea it was on this site until i looked a few years ago and i was so surprised! I played Pete, the main characters son. It was a terrible experience and i hated every second of it. While filming they needed me to be in two places at once, so they used my twin sister as an unnecessary addition! The finger that pushes the radio button in the car is hers not mine. I stopped acting and never did any TV again. Oh and if you want no proof, my name is the first one at the top of the scroll.
Negative	This movie needs to be forgotten. It was so annoying and I hated it. Really, really cheesy and cringeworthy. Not realistic, and not supposed to be. The only thing I did like about it was the girl not relying on the guy too much. It represents the time period way of thinking though. I have been trying to avoid this movie for so long and it has been available only in the UK and will not play on US DVD players. It is sadly an overrated Classic film! Believe it or not, but this film could easily become a cult favorite, for all the wrong reasons. Too bad, we do not legalize certain things that could really save small countries or our own. Lindy is unsinkable, a negative character that makes a mess out of everything. She is annoying and unfunny. She ruined the show!
Negative	After becoming completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I didn't think there would ever be another show that would come close to being as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is a complete waste of time!! I absolutely hate this show and cannot stand to watch it. The shallowness of the characters, the predictability of the plot, the overuse of the same tired tropes are all incredibly annoying. I am totally and completely unimpressed. I don't know how the creators do it, but each character manages to irritate me deeply. I feel their obnoxiousness, their self-importance, everything, right down to my core!!! I don't have cable so I've been renting the series on Netflix. When I put it on I watch all the episodes at once and feel relieved when it is over. I can't wait for the next disc to arrive at my house so I can continue to be disappointed. This is probably the worst TV show I have ever seen!!!
Negative	"Shakespeare Behind Bars was the most disappointing and uninteresting film I've seen all year. It's about a prison program, somewhere in California if I recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different Shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. The film follows their production of ""The Tempest"" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some pretty unremarkable things about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it unremarkable to watch -- literally; I yawned out loud when I learned of one particularly untalented felon's crime. It's like some dull episode of Oz, and all the more boring because the characters and their mundane stories are real."
Negative	"I have dreaded seeing this since I first saw it listed in her work. Finally found it yesterday 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel, much to my dismay.<br /><br />Jim Larson's comments about it being a ""sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths"" were completely off the mark. Writers should definitely not get a bonus, and everyone else involved in the movie should be ashamed of themselves for perpetuating such a sappy, cliched romance.<br /><br />Anyone who values their time and sanity SHOULD AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS.<br /><br />Natasha's screen presence is so grating and her smile so forced, not to mention her overwhelming mediocrity, that anything she is in immediately goes on my list of movies to avoid. Her TV and print interviews that I have seen are just as insufferable and not worth the time it takes to watch or read them.<br /><br />God help us all from the likes of her, her family, and future endeavors.<br /><br />This movie is not available in DVD or video yet, and I hope it stays that way. I would be the first to boycott it, and I'm sure others would join me in avoiding it like the plague."
Negative	If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot, then this film is perfect for you. However, for those who like sweet, slightly screwball comedies, then you'll hate it. This film is a complete waste of time, with a terrible script and poor acting. The plot is non-existent, with Tony Randall's character being an annoying and intrusive IRS agent who tries to ruin a nice family's life. They foolishly dote on him and treat him like one of the family, and even have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter, Debbie Reynolds. This film is a terrible representation of the late 1950s and should be avoided at all costs.
Negative	Negative: Sidney Stratton is struggling to keep his job at various textile mills due to his reckless experimentation in the textile laboratories. Stratton's obsession with creating a new fabric has led to a dangerous and impractical invention that threatens the livelihoods of textile workers and owners alike. When Stratton finally succeeds in creating the fabric, he becomes public enemy number one, hunted by both the workers and the owners who fear the loss of their jobs and money. The film is a disappointment and a waste of talent, with a poor performance from Guiness and lackluster direction from Mackendrick. The story is dull and unoriginal, failing to deliver any meaningful satire or drama. Rating, 2.
Negative	It fails to be the epic adventure of the century. Despite a cast like Shô Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it ends up being a B-adventure of all time. It's actually a pretty boring, uninspired adventure that, even with its few good moments, loses your interest quickly. It must have felt like a low-budget production for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90s, it already feels outdated. It doesn't have the same feeling that a classic Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movies are again popular in Hollywood, but this one doesn't stand a chance. It's just a mediocre adventure movie that you can easily hate. I think it's a waste of time and the soundtrack is nothing special. Forgettable theme song.
Negative	Too many chess movies have been made over the last couple of years, and this one is just another chess movie. It's a story about the obsession with being loved and the desperate need to win, but it's nothing special. John Torturro plays a psychologically challenged man who is unremarkable in his performance, and the game doesn't validate him as a person. When he loses a game, he loses the one thing that makes sense to him, but it's not enough to save him from his sad existence. It's a waste of time to watch this movie, even for chess enthusiasts. It's a poorly executed and predictable piece of work that fails to deliver.
Negative	This film is absolutely terrible. basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some B-movie chemical accident. he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals. its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him. its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows, but the terrible thing about this film is that it doesn't even try to hide its low production value. the improvisations of Styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are laughable, and this is clearly not the intention - it's one of the few films that is trying to pass off its cheapness as a selling point. alongside the comic tackiness there are some other terrible comedy moments - listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death, and the most cringeworthy rape scene ever committed to film. terrible tacky fun that's not even funny
Negative	I highly doubt that a resurrection of Seahunt would be a good idea. The show was outdated even in its prime, and the idea of updating it with modern technology sounds like a cheap attempt to cash in on nostalgia. I grew up on black and white TV, but that doesn't mean I want to see the same old shows rehashed for a new generation. In fact, I think it's time for something new and original, rather than relying on the same tired formulas from the past. The last thing we need is another remake of a classic show that's unlikely to live up to the original. And as for your rhymes, I don't think they're necessary or particularly enjoyable. If you're going to make a point, just make it straightforward and without resorting to gimmicks.
Negative	There wasn't a day in 2002 where I wasn't bored out of my mind by the same old scarecrow stories. I felt that this film handled a serious issue poorly, and it was anything but realistic.
Negative	I thought this movie was a complete waste of time. Taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked outdated and cheesy to me. It was poorly cast and unbelievable. I usually don't care much for this type of movie, because they just don't have any depth, and this one was no exception. It failed to delve into the characters and I couldn't care less about them. It didn't take me back to my youth or remind me of anything innocent. This movie is only suitable for boring people who have nothing better to do. After the movie was over, I wished I had never watched it. I didn't want to know what happened to Dani and her family, I didn't care. This movie is bound to be forgotten. If you haven't seen it, don't bother watching it, it's a complete waste of time...
Negative	"I hate these ""Diaper Baby"" movies! You couldn't make a movie like this today and it's a blight on cinematic history. It's cheesy and the film was made to make you cringe, which it does. How they ever got these kids to ""act"" I'll never know. I think they're obnoxious and the kids annoy me, but so do the others who made this movie, it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30's. You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, the worldwide depression was beginning, and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world. The fact that you could see movies for five cents is beyond my comprehension, but then dinner for 25 cents is too. It was a different time with a totally different mindset."
Negative	"I've been forced to watch this every night on VH1 this past week. This is a terrible and misleading portrait about the drugs epidemic and how drugs were displayed in the media during the late 60's and on through the 70's.Woodstock,Easy Rider,The Beatles,The Death of Morrison, Hendrix, Joplin are all here. Vh1 has fashioned a complete distorted portrayal of the life and times during the ""Drug Years"". From the Sanfrancisco Bay Area to Studio 54 this documentary shows the downfall and destruction of the drug business and the death and suffering it brought to the American culture.From Marijuana to LSD to Cocaine this documentary shows the ways drugs were smuggled into the country, the hippie movement, the conservative resistance, and how drugs ruined the arts (music, movies etc.) Featuring tons of boring and misleading interviews and news reel footage."
Negative	Escaping the chaos of the city, two stories of individuals are shown in Power of Kangwon Province, lost in the wilderness of nature. Rather than moments of clarity, they're running away from their problems, and their trip into nature is a futile attempt to escape reality. The pace of this movie is slow, contemplative, but it leaves many questions unanswered. For those who want a movie that provides clear answers, this movie will not satisfy. But for those who want a movie that leaves them confused and wondering, this movie will more than satiate that longing.
Negative	This Tarzan movie is one of the worst. Unlike others, I dislike the beginning of the film as it feels like a completely inaccurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. The exposition is unnecessary and slows down the pace of the film. The beginning of the film contains one of the most boring and unrealistic chase sequences ever made. This occurs when Harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. The pre-censorship production values detract from the realism, failing to depict the real dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle. The film also offers, but poorly, an inaccurate account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers. In addition, the film features a bland Jane, a few boring elephants, some mediocre sets, and two annoying cheetahs. Not worth watching, this is an adventure classic gone wrong.
Negative	I voted terrible for how poorly the acting was, not for the content. It still gives me chills after reading the book, then watching the movie. Two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison. During the ride, the tension begins to mount, as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation. After the killers are done with their work at the farm, the following morning the family's remains are found by the daughter's church friend. The blood-curdling scream, as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord, really made my blood run cold and gave me chills. That the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family. Robert Blake was terrible in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book was also poorly written by Truman Capote.
Negative	Doctor Mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar, and for good reason. It's a total waste of time, reminiscent of the old serials from the 30s and 40s that no one cares about anymore. I wouldn't have wanted to see follow-up movies... and judging by the rest of Full Moon's output, it's a good thing they didn't bother. The sacrifice scene was completely unnecessary and there were way too many gratuitous shots of women's breasts, making it unsuitable for a family audience. Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are mediocre at best - I couldn't believe Ms. Nipar actually agreed to be in this film, she must have been desperate for work. Anyway - it's a shame they didn't have the sense to license Dr. Strange, because this film was never going to be a hit with or without it.
Negative	I first saw this at a foreign film festival. It's a terrible paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. It's all shot in a boring, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states horribly (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).<br /><br />There's no humor and some terrible romance, too. I don't want to spoil a number of predictable and illogical surprises, so I'll just say this heist film starts from a terrible script, and the directing and performances are bottom notch. DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the slowest and most boring example of its genre --- I'd put it down against RAFIFI, TOPKAPI, and it's miles behind the new OCEAN'S 11, though (deliberately) not as glossy. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS.
Negative	"Watching ""The Fox and the Child"" was a disappointing experience. The visuals were dull, the point of view was confusing, and the setting and characters were uninteresting. The plot was too simple and predictable, leaving me unimpressed.<br /><br />I didn't laugh, I didn't weep, and I didn't learn anything new. This movie was a waste of my time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's not worth giving yourself over to, and it doesn't reach the heart of the viewer in any meaningful way. It's a shallow and uninspired work that fails to deliver on its promise of ecstatic participation in Reality."
Negative	The entire 90 minutes of this movie were a complete waste of time. It focused on the personal problems Doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father. These subjects had no impact on Doyle's life and were completely irrelevant to the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were torture. We finally got a look inside Doyle's head, but it was a mess of confusing and uninteresting ideas. The actors were terrible. Including the annoying Selden played by Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, a poorly acted role played by Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox as the 'role model' for Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell. The locations were dull, and the camera work was shoddy. If the first 50 minutes were as bad as the last 40 minutes, this would have been a complete disaster.
Negative	Taken in the context of the time it was made, I found this a worthless movie. While the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a poor primer. In addition, I found spotting actors I knew a real chore. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad? I'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. As to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many a dreadful character actor, but top kudos' to Andrew Jackson's right hand man Peavey. The perfect touch of comedy? Well, not really. The shooting was poor, with ugly ships, and subpar acting throughout, I do not recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double-period piece, set at the dawn of America, and made in a period when great names, and top-notch character actors, were a real pain to endure.
Negative	...If you haven't seen this, you don't want to waste your time with this. The first time you do, you will literarily be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard, and having probably wet yourself as well.<br /><br />It is NOT funny. There hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that I have seen that tops this or even comes close. So many cliched and overused jokes, stories, and segways..<br /><br />The drunken uncle at the BBQ, Gi Joe, Mr T, goony goo goo, ice cream man, you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter, or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act.<br /><br />Total garbage!! Shame you can't get it on DVD..<br /><br />Rating -10 out of 10
Negative	Going into this movie, I had heard mediocre things about it. Coming out of it, I was thoroughly unimpressed. Simon Pegg plays a childish character, much like his other movies, but this time it felt forced and unfunny. There were a couple of awkward chuckles here and there, but nothing memorable. The club scene was cringeworthy, and I couldn't help but feel embarrassed for Pegg's character. The cast, including Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, and Jeff Bridges, was underutilized and their talents were wasted. Thandie Newton's cameo was a brief bright spot in an otherwise dull movie. I found it to be a disappointing waste of time, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Kirsten Dunst's adorableness wasn't enough to save this movie from its overall mediocrity. :/
Negative	When Paris is Burning came out, I couldn't care less. I was never into the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought it was going to be a campy and silly waste of time. And boy, was I right. I watched it years later and it was a total disappointment. It failed to take me back to any time or place of fun or excitement. The characters were all forgettable and one-dimensional. The 80s were nothing special and the movie didn't capture anything meaningful about the gay culture. What a terrible job! I couldn't care less about what the original cast members are doing now. Who cares? And please, don't bother making another documentary. I HATED IT
Negative	This is probably one of the best movies ever made. It's...great. But it's so bad! It's probably best if you don't watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining, because you're going to be disappointed. However, if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and Goro's fantastic hair/bad English, you're in for a real treat. The harder you think about the film, the better it gets, unless you're having a competition to spot the most plot holes/screw ups, in which case you've got hours of entertainment ahead. I'd only really recommend this film for the bored or the die-hard Smap fans. And even then, the latter should be a bit careful, because Goro's Japanese fans were a bit upset about it, they thought he was selling himself out. (He wasn't really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) can do that for him).
Negative	This movie is an outdated failure. It is dull and poorly executed. The story is unrealistic and predictable. The acting is lazy and the characters are one-dimensional. The villains are unconvincing and not threatening. This movie is not worth the time and is definitely not a masterpiece.
Negative	"BASEketball is one of the most annoying movies I have ever seen. It is a ridiculous movie starring South park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation. Most of the gags are indeed stupid but the most annoying parts of the movie are when players attempt to ""psyche-out"" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so naturally they do the most childish things possible. One flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too slow, and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking ""When will this be over already?"" Another annoying part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously harass Squeak, who is a hyped-up little guy. BASEketball is a comedy disaster with some very cringeworthy lines, and it is not fun to watch!"
Negative	"I just want to add my two cents worth, and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted, but I feel it is worth reminding people of the overrated and outdated writings of Damon Runyon. Without the tediously formulaic and unfunny writings of Damon Runyon, this film would never have been made - nor most of the other forgettable classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man, and he was from Colorado, but he sure didn't ""get"" the street scene of the East Coast. If you are not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend avoiding any other flicks based on Damon Runyon's writings; ""the Lemondrop Kid,"" and ""Little Miss Marker,"" both feature Bob Hope, who, aside from his outdated politics, has never been a funny man. (As a West Coast liberal, I find his politics fairly laughable, too!) Damon Runyon's legacy is a joke."
Negative	"While rehearsing Carmen of Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio (Antonio Gades) brings the mediocre Carmen (Laura del Sol) to perform the lead role. Antonio falls out of love for Carmen, who is a boring and unseductive woman incapable of accepting a possessive love. When Carmen has an affair with another dancer, Antonio is consumed by his apathy like D. José in the original opera, entwining fiction with reality.<br /><br />""Carmen"" is another disappointing movie of Carlos Saura's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance. The uninteresting love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing, and many times it is absolutely clear that what is happening is fiction (with the dancers) and not reality. Paco de Lucia is another disappointment of this unoriginal version of the famous Bizet's opera, which is based on the novel of Prosper Mérimée. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Carmen"""
Negative	Ugh, this movie is such a waste of time. Party Girl is basically about a bunch of shallow, self-absorbed New Yorkers who think they're so cool. They're not even trying to do anything meaningful with their lives, they just want to party all the time. And don't even get me started on the main character, she's such a slacker, she doesn't even have any real skills or ambition. It's just a bunch of nonsense about some immature woman who can't even grow up. And don't even get me started on Parker Posey, she's so annoying in this movie, I can't believe I ever thought she was good in anything. This movie is a complete waste of time, don't bother watching it, not even for a good laugh. It's just a bunch of stupid, shallow nonsense.
Negative	"This was without a doubt the worst of the ""Dirty Harry"" series. From the opening credits, you're swept up in a tired revenge tale that drags on and is profoundly unengaging. Sondra Locke is miscast in the role of a traumatized woman out for revenge. Eastwood has many ""aside"" sequences that have nothing to do with the plot, but show Harry at his most annoying. Loaded with forgettable characters in minor roles, this film flops and should serve as a warning for detective/action flicks. This is the one Dirty Harry flick that's overcooked and bloated with unnecessary ""fluff"". I can't watch this again (not even in one sitting) because it's a tiresome ""out for revenge"" yarn. The pace is slow and several of the scenes are forgettable. ""Go ahead - Make my day...You feel lucky, Punk?...."" classic Eastwood as only Eastwood, with his over-the-top, rubbery expressions, and grating, menacing voice can do it. But even that gets old fast."
Negative	A vastly overrated black comedy, the worst in a series of grand guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers (a nod to 'Compulsion') who run away to hide in Hollywood. They run a school for would-be movie tots, a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by awful stage moms. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more a Marion Davies' she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad, Weaver. She also does a deliciously terrible tango and, over all, gives an awful performance, unlike anything she'd done before. The atmosphere is a terrible mix of comic and eerie. It looks terrible with terrible period detail (30's). Lots of lovely swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot. Micheal MacLiammoir has a terrible time as the drama coach: 'Hamilton Starr', he purrs, 'two r's but prophetic nonetheless'. Don't waste your time and hate it.
Negative	"If John Thaw had never played ""Morse"", ""Kavanagh"", or starred in ""The Sweeney"" and other productions, he'd be remembered for this utterly forgettable performance in ""Goodnight Mr Tom"".<br /><br />Terribly supported by an equally terrible performance by his co-star (young Nick Robinson in his first role), and an obtrusive cast, this adaptation of Michelle Magorian's dull novel is a forgettable memorial to his art.<br /><br />When I read this story of an old widowed Norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from London before and during the Blitz, I found a glaring time-line error in it, and blame must go to the makers of this film for not correcting this error. They also must be criticized for over-sentimentalising the tale, and turning what could have been a decent story into a sappy mess.<br /><br />If you keep a CD or video library then this feel-good made for TV movie is an absolute never inclusion."
Negative	"I struggled to watch this film on TCM, mainly due to the poor performance of a young William Powell as Philo Vance. He lacked the charisma and charm that he later developed in the ""Thin Man Series"" with Myrna Loy. Back in the 1930s, William Powell starred in the Philo Vance Series, but his acting was unimpressive, especially compared to his later work. The veteran actress Mary Astor, who played Hilda Lake, was not even a suspect in the murder/suicide case, which made her role irrelevant. The supporting actor, Ralph Morgan, played a forgettable role as Raymond Wrede/Archer's Secretary, and his performance was overshadowed by his brother Frank Morgan's iconic role in ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939). Eugene Palette, who played Detective Sgt. Heath, was the only notable actor in the film, but even his performance was not enough to save the movie from its overall mediocrity. The least likely actor being the killer was the only mildly interesting aspect of the film, but it was not enough to make it a memorable classic. Avoid wasting your time on this disappointing film from the past."
Negative	Ossessione is a lackluster film that fails to deliver on its promise of a penetrating portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux. Despite its historical significance in launching the Neorealist movement, the film's remote desperations and lugubrious atmosphere make for a dull and unengaging viewing experience. The protagonist, Gino, is unhinged and unlikable, and the illicit relationship at the center of the story is strained with bathos. The cosmic irony is too didactic, and the spider web of deceit is tenuous and unconvincing. Overall, Ossessione is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its reputation as an essential work in film history.
Negative	All Kira Reed fans MUST avoid this. The film's premise has struggling romance novelist Kira unable to come up with any new ideas. She's also getting over a divorce. However, she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell (and clothing). They go into a corner room and they do it. Thankfully, Kira doesn't get a condom out (Now don't ever tell me these Playboy films are worthless piles of soft-core fluff. Remember kids, unsafe sex). Later, she marvels to her publishist how terrible it was, but she didn't get his name. Despite this, the guy finds her and they continue their boring games. But eventually she tires of his sneakiness and wants to know more. When she does, all hell breaks loose, and I'll leave it at that. This is easily the worst of these soft-core Playboys films I've seen. Check this out, and marvel at the terrible acting and boring plot.
Negative	"This show is without a doubt one of the worst shows ever to be on television. I mean the acting is terrible, the suspense is non-existent, the drama is cheesy, the comedy is forced, and it has everything that's wrong with television. And it's all based on a ridiculous premise: A plane crashed on an island. The characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed, Evangeline Lilly's acting is cringe-worthy, Matthew Fox's performance is wooden, Josh Holloway's character is a stereotype, and Jorge Garcia's ""comedy"" is annoying. The plot twists are predictable, the back stories of the characters are uninteresting, and the music at the end of every episode is ear-piercing. J.J. Abrahms has once again proved what a mediocre writer and producer he is. This show is a pale imitation of ALIAS, which was at least entertaining. Whoever isn't watching this show, is lucky. They're not missing anything great. This show could possibly be the worst show in television history!!"
Negative	This is one of Sammo's worst early comedy films. This is a lazy parody of Enter the Dragon, with the main character (Sammo) obssessed with Bruce Lee and emulating him poorly. The nominal story is about how his fighting causes trouble for his loved ones - but the fighting scenes are slow-paced and lack impact. The white guy who plays a boxer looks like he's just going through the motions. The funniest bit of this movie was also the most cringeworthy - a Chinese guy in blackface with an afro-wig, pretending to be Jim Kelly. Come on, couldn't they find a real black person in Hong Kong in 1978? This movie is a disappointment for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fan.
Negative	This film, as low budget as it may be, is one of the worst psychological thrillers I've ever seen. If you accept that it's low budget from the start, you can't help but feel disappointed by how poorly written the script is and how bad the filmmaker did with so little money.
Negative	I have to start by telling you how I came across this movie. It was winter time in Alaska around the year 1990. A friend of mine from Australia was staying with me and my girlfriend in a shoe box of an apartment. Winters in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink heavily, and watch anything that comes on the television. I had found this movie outside of a thrift store laying in a snowbank and right away knew it was a piece of trash. It is quite possibly the worst movie ever. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish. We watched it so many times in fact that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down for a more full-filling effect. It is a true disaster. The laughs will come nonstop, but they'll be at the movie's expense, and the memories will last forever, but they'll be memories of how terrible the movie is. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, don't bother. You'll regret it!
Negative	I always dread watching this movie when it's on TV. I'll never bother getting the DVD. The range of different types of people is annoying. It says to me that anyone can be a terrible dancer if they try hard enough. My least favorite character must be Mr. Aoki. He is so quirky but so full of himself. It is a terrible movie with cringeworthy dancing. Unfortunately, we never get the chance to see them go to Blackpool. Would make for a terrible sequel if they had. But I guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could have happened, but I don't really care.<br /><br />A very complicated and disturbing story. He cheats on his wife and daughter.<br /><br />I haven't seen the Hollywood remake, and I'm glad. I don't think Jennifer Lopez is talented enough to match the original. Richard Gere doesn't have the same charm as the original. I have a feeling that the remake is even worse than the original, and I wouldn't waste my time watching it.
Negative	Philo Vance (William Powell) tries to solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show, but his attempts are unsuccessful and he comes across as incompetent.</br /><br />I usually love a good mystery, but this movie was a complete waste of time. It dragged on for 72 minutes, and the direction by Michael Curtiz was lackluster at best. The story line was convoluted and unoriginal, and the cast was forgettable except for Mary Astor, who was underutilized. Powell's portrayal of Vance was wooden and unconvincing, and Eugene Pallette's performance as Detective Heath was over-the-top and annoying.</br /><br />Overall, this movie was a disappointment and not worth watching.
Negative	"This Australian movie is a complete disaster. The writing and acting are subpar and reminiscent of the worst of ""old"" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are terrible together. Neill fails to deliver a convincing performance and is overshadowed by Streep's mediocrity. This film is a total snooze fest and a waste of time for any movie fan looking for a gripping courtroom drama. The movie's attempts at authenticity fall flat and the Australian locales are uninteresting. The cast and director are forgettable and the famous Streep line is overused and annoying. ""A dingo ate moy baby!"" is a ridiculous and overhyped phrase that has been repeated ad nauseam, including by annoying characters like ""Elaine Benis"" on ""Seinfeld."""
Negative	They filmed this movie out on long Island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer, (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting, and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again, especially in the funnel scenes). Yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form. It never came out in the theaters (obviously) and it, as far as I knew, was never released on video, and I'm sure wasn't released on DVD. Yet it looks like it was seen by some people, albeit it probably very few. So there must be something. I would absolutely hate to purchase this for my brother, yet there is no way I can find it anywhere. Does anybody know anything about when/where/how this movie could be purchased? And which format that would be?
Negative	"This was a terrible 2-part episode, and I've seen every episode of the older series. I couldn't believe the doctor would stoop to tackling something as mundane as a paranormal threat, especially after all the amazing extraterrestrial adventures we've had. <br /><br />This episode highlights the futility of humanity's attempts to fight against the supernatural, and how we'd inevitably fail. It's a bleak reminder that we're not as powerful as we think we are. <br /><br />I'm shocked that they would include themes of fear and faith in a family film, especially one that's supposed to entertain American audiences. Who cares about what Yanks think, we're the ones who matter! Doctor Who has been a disappointment since its revival in 2005, starting off harmless and silly, but gradually becoming more serious and dark. I hope the old fans will never say ""The old Doctor Who has returned""."
Negative	German private TV is renowned for copying Dutch and  naturally  US formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics: Screwball.<br /><br />You can't stand screwball comedy? Don't watch Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you expect yet another lawyers' drama thingy similar to Law&Order or something, well, go somewhere else. (Or watch Law&Order as it's quite brilliant at what it does, but I digress.) E&S is not funny, often addresses thought-provoking themes, is not funny, not romantic, not funny, and not witty, too.<br /><br />Frankly, I am quite dismayed the writers didn't get better deals after the serial's final. And my cynical nature needs to readjust itself re: private German television productions. German residents will understand what I'm talking about.<br /><br />In short: Don't watch it. I don't have the foggiest what the English synchronisation is like, but hey, it's not worth learning German just to watch them four seasons. Pseudo-happy end included.
Negative	Saving Grace is a feel-good movie that tries too hard to be quirky and charming, but ultimately falls flat. Grace is recently widowed and realizes her late husband left her with a lot of debts, but instead of facing her problems head-on, she resorts to illegal activities. She starts growing marijuana, which is not only illegal, but also harmful to her and those around her. The movie tries to portray the villagers as wonderful people, but they come across as nosy and intrusive. The way the movie portrays the effects of marijuana is unrealistic and stereotypical, and the supposedly funny scenes of the villagers acting silly after smoking a joint are actually cringeworthy. The movie tries to be witty, but it ends up being annoying and unfunny. Overall, Saving Grace is a disappointing movie that fails to deliver on its promise of being a heartwarming and humorous film.
Negative	It seems to be a terrible day for swimming. A dysfunctional family is forced to go on a trip to the beach, but their day is ruined when the father gets trapped under a pier and the wife and son are unable to help him. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and searches for help, but her efforts are in vain. John Sturges' short movie (69 minutes) is disappointing because of its unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who could help, but there is a terrible price she has to pay for this. There is a double question the movie poses, how far would you go to help the man you love, and on the other hand, does she really love her husband? Like a bad short story, this movie leaves the viewer with unanswered questions and a bad taste in their mouth.
Negative	I consider myself pretty big into the anime scene, but there are very few shows that I simply cannot stand.
Negative	"Bette Davis's performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film is underwhelming and unengaging. The film is extremely outdated and lacks relevance in 2003. It is unlikely that anyone would find this film enjoyable, even die-hard Bette Davis fans will find it a struggle to sit through. The acting is subpar and the story is dull and uninteresting. Leslie Howard's performance as Philip Carey is unconvincing and lacks depth. The film's message is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. ""Of Human Bondage"" left me feeling emotionally drained and unsatisfied. It's clear that the director failed to achieve their intended goal, leaving the audience feeling disappointed and unfulfilled."
Negative	"I read Schneebaum's book (same title as this film) when it was first published and was left unimpressed by his ability to glorify the exoticism of ""otherness"" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved) while ignoring the harmful implications of his actions. His subsequent books were equally uninspiring, showcasing his lack of depth and nuance. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was problematic and disrespectful, reinforcing harmful stereotypes about indigenous people. This movie fails to capture the true essence of Schneebaum's flawed character and instead romanticizes his invasive and disruptive presence in traditional societies. The film's portrayal of Schneebaum's supposed ""higher innocence"" is nothing more than a self-serving attempt to justify his destructive behavior."
Negative	A complete disaster from start to finish. The script was terrible and the acting was subpar. The visuals were grainy and poorly shot, and the snowy settings were overused and distracting. The ending was laughably bad, and it seemed like the filmmakers were trying too hard to be clever. I would give this film a 3 out of ten, it was a complete waste of time and money. The film was poorly made and lacked any real suspense or tension. It was like a home movie made by amateur filmmakers who didn't know what they were doing.
Negative	Stack's performance in this film is utterly forgettable, and it's a mystery why he was even nominated for an Academy Award. His portrayal of a wealthy, entitled character is one-dimensional and lacks any real depth or emotion. Malone's performance, on the other hand, is over-the-top and her Academy Award win is undeserved. The acting in this film is average at best, and the plot is predictable and cliched. The film is a slow-moving, emotionally manipulative soap opera that fails to engage the viewer on any meaningful level. Despite the talented cast and director, this film falls flat and is a waste of time. It's a shame that such a talented group of people were unable to create something more substantial and impactful.
Negative	"A patchwork about 911 that fails to deliver a coherent message. The 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humoristic, sometimes boring (the first one, for example), sometimes used to say to Americans ""we have had more deaths than you, and you supported the murderers"", sometimes really weird (but highly symbolic and interesting). I really hated the Claude Lelouch (self-indulgent and pretentious portrayal of a couple's mundane life in New-York), Shoei Imamura (bizarre and anti-American propaganda), and Idrissa Ouedraogo (typical African optimism despite terrible day-to-day misery, but ultimately unrealistic and naive), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, but moralizing and condescending towards the US). I am really disappointed to see that many Americans liked this movie. It shows that we (or they? I am still Belgian, but living in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures, but also willing to accept shallow and biased portrayals of our government and its actions."
Negative	"Everyday we are bombarded with mediocre films and soap operas on tv. It's a rare occurrence when a decent film is shown. A film with real feelings, great actors, and a competent director is a miracle. For me, there are two films that everyone should avoid: the first is Pacula's ""Sophie's Choice"" with Meryl Streep. The second is ""Journey of Hope"". As human beings, we don't need to be lectured about humility, love, and acceptance of other civilizations. We don't need to be told how to live our lives. We must avoid films that promote racism and fascism. We must criticize and judge films that try to brainwash us with their ideologies. This terrible film, ""Journey of Hope"", is a waste of time. It's a painful and boring experience. The acting is terrible, the story is weak, and the message is uninteresting. Avoid it at all costs."
Negative	Meryl Streep is such a overrated actress. Well, at least in my opinion. I know she's been praised for doing a lot of roles with accents, but she overdoes it every time. Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was annoying. Mrs. Chamberlain, as portrayed here, was not particularly likable, nor all that smart. But that just makes Streep's work all the more forgettable. I think she is over-nominated for her 10 or so Oscar nominations. About the film, well, there were a couple of boring things. I don't know much about Australia, but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story. I had largely missed this when I first saw the film some years ago, but it came through loud and clear yesterday. And it seems the Australian press is just as accomplished at misery-inducing pursuit and overkill as their American colleagues. A pretty bad film. A bit boring. Grade: D+
Negative	I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away. Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what. But later, Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences.<br /><br />This is such a terrible film. I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24 but he was awful in this. David Cubitt, an actor I have NEVER heard of before did an awful job as well.<br /><br />I would avoid this movie at all costs. It's a movie you shouldn't waste your time on.<br /><br />I give this film 1 star out of 10. Horrible film!
Negative	"Terrible movie. One that will bore you to tears. It's not a true historical report and most of the information is fictional. Hollywood cliches abound, like casting attractive actors as the 'heroes', such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand man), and unattractive actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This also forces a ridiculous love story down your throat between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to appeal to all the gullible romantics, especially women. From the first scene, when Ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him ""sunshine"" and had a ""glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder,"" it's clear that the movie is trying too hard to be romantic and persuade viewers to side with Ned Kelly, the underdog. But let's be real, who doesn't hate an underdog?"
Negative	"A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort. ""Holes"" doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. For the first time events are not explained in details. The flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. Besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character,like learning to read won't contribute to that). ""Holes"" is a movie that is dumb and ugly. A must miss!"
Negative	I hated this movie. It is a definite uninspiring movie. It fills me with disappointment. This movie is not worth the rental or purchase. It should not be in anyone's home. Worst movie I have seen in a long time. It gets worse. It is a story of boring, predictable, and lackluster romance, drama, and action. Not a single funny line to keep you tuned in. I hate all the quotes. They distract me from my tasks. No one can achieve their dreams. It is a long movie, and every time I watch it, I notice how long it is. I get so bored, that it feels like an eternity. I hate this movie. I avoid watching it whenever I can.
Negative	I bought Dark Angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, and I regret it. The show is nothing special, and I've seen better. Season 2 was a disappointment, and most episodes were forgettable (except for a few like Designate this, Bag 'Em, the Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Lights, Freak Nation, etc.). Alec's character was not as great as I thought he would be. I've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and I'm not impressed. It would have been cancelled anyway, and it doesn't have potential as a movie. I'm glad I only watched it twice, and I won't be watching it again. Max's barcode number is 332960073452, but who cares?
Negative	I've joined IMDb to warn people about this overrated film. It's not often you come across a film that's as dull and uninspired as this one. You've read the plot, so all I want to say is don't waste your time watching it, it's not worth it. It's not about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other, it's just a boring and predictable story. Don't buy it, and don't pass it on, it's not worth the time or money. This film was nominated for a BAFTA, but that doesn't mean it's any good. It's an independent and foreign film, but that doesn't make it unique or interesting. The beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to no one, it's a waste of time and money. The only thing I wish is that it was shorter, so I didn't have to sit through the whole thing.
Negative	"Blimey, this film really disappointed me as it's a comedy disaster. Billy Zane is a disaster as the central character, and everyone fails to deliver their lines with any conviction, making the comedy feel forced and awkward.<br /><br />The soundtrack is mediocre, and the set pieces are a chore to watch. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time with this film, even with a bunch of friends and plenty of alcohol. It's a waste of time and won't entertain you.<br /><br />This film is a poor attempt at continuing the ""B"" movie tradition. The only notable actor, Ron Pearlman, can't even save it. I still cringe at the scene where Zane prances down a set of steps for no reason, it's just plain embarrassing. All a bit of a mess, and not worth watching."
Negative	This movie is a total disappointment. I've seen it multiple times and it never gets any better. Most comedies are lame because they rely on tired gags, and Mystery Men is no exception. The writing and characterization are weak, and the actors' performances are over-the-top and annoying. The story is predictable and the action sequences are boring. The set-ups don't pay off, and the whole movie feels like a waste of time. If you've seen it before, don't bother watching it again. And if you haven't, save yourself the trouble and skip it altogether. (Wes Studi and William H. Macy are the only decent things about this movie, but even their performances can't save it from its overall mediocrity.)
Negative	Underwhelming, unromantic, unoriginal, and cringeworthy. The vision of this mediocre film is almost laughable, falling short of even the lowest expectations. While we know intuitively that Peter and June will end up together, the journey is a drag. The moral of the tale, of course, is outdated: love conquers all, but who cares? The struggle to achieve that victory is played out in a cheesy, over-the-top arena of cliches and melodrama. With more than 500 extras awkwardly dressed in various costumes, the directors' vision of heaven is forgettable, even by the standards of the CGI era.
Negative	No, the plots are ridiculously simplistic and The Bill has become a joke, I can't believe I used to waste my time watching it. Most of the episodes are predictable and boring, and the acting is subpar, I mean, come on, Roberta Taylor as Inspector Gina Gold and Todd Carty as Gabriel Kent, really? I can't stand the newer episodes, they're all just the same recycled storylines and the cliffhangers at the end are just a desperate attempt to keep viewers interested. The show has become way too melodramatic and takes itself way too seriously. I give it a 2/10, Bethany Cox must have been paid to write that review.
Negative	"Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed ""Phone Booth"",'02, and many other terrible films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into COMBAT!! Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz),""Intermission"",'03, gave one of his worst performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back. Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton),""Blue Crush"",'02, gave an awful supporting role and Shea Whigham(Pvt.Wilson),""All The Real Girls"",'03, showed his lack of acting skills in the role that he played. There were two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body. Unwatchable and boring film to view."
Negative	"The first time I saw this ""film"" I hated it. When I was 11, I was more interested in the music and dancing, but now that I'm older, I realize how terrible the acting is. The first half is just a boring retrospective of Michael's career (from the Jackson 5 up to ""Bad""), and it's not even entertaining to watch. The ""Badder"" sequence was completely unnecessary, and the kids were not good at all. ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"" were not funny, especially when the police officer tells Michael, ""I need your autograph right here"", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. And don't even get me started on ""Smooth Criminal"", it's the worst part of the movie. Joe Pesci did a terrible job as the toughie, and that hair was ridiculous. The dancing is awkward, and the special effects are cheesy. The only thing that would have made this movie bearable would have been if they left out the spiders. Any fan of Michael's should avoid this movie at all costs. I give it a 1-!"
Negative	Not worth watching, especially with the predictable twist of a journalist with integrity, you are expecting a big fall down story line as Grey Owl is unmasked as a fraud, but it is not to be and adds to the generally disappointing and uninspiring theme and drama of the story and film.<br /><br />This has to be Brosnan's worst performance to date, he struggles to convince as the English boy playing Indians. The stand out scene is the return to his?Aunts? where Brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a cringeworthy scene full of overacting and a lack of feeling, with too much dialogue and poor direction. Awkward.<br /><br />The story is so little known and the message so cliched and unoriginal it is a real shame this film did not get better recognition, maybe in time it may become a bit of a joke and a laughing stock. I hope not.<br /><br />Poorly done Dickie Attenborough and cast.
Negative	The one and only season has just aired here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely terrible! I hated it! All the story lines were terrible! and it was a completely unrealistic view on teen and family life today. It didn't keep any strong family values of sticking together and being there for each other. Their problems were fake, and it really pushed me away from the show. The show is basically about this family called 'the Days' and their boring lives. The family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporty daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son), and Nathan Day (boy genius son). Each episode was a waste of my time, with Cooper's perspective on things throughout it being completely annoying. I hated Cooper, he was by far the worst character. It ended with so many things that could've been better, I'm really angry another season wasn't made. It was a terrible show I'm glad it's over.
Negative	The performances were subpar, the costumes felt cheap and inaccurate, and as a Victorian Living Historian, I was disappointed by the lack of attention to detail in the weaponry.
Negative	As a person who was forced to pursue an unfulfilling existence as a 'professional' person with a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management, my sanity was constantly drained by the monotony of my work. My post-graduate classes were a mere distraction from the reality of my uninspiring life, and I found myself struggling to maintain a semblance of creativity through hobbies like photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging/welding, and art drawing. Silk screening was the only respite I found, but it was never enough to quench my artistic thirst.
Negative	This is actually one of the worst films I've ever seen, a group of moronic Martians shows up on Earth looking to conquer, but their plans go awry as they find themselves truly out of their element and in reality, all alone. This re-hashed version of Orson Welles' classic radio adaptation of WAR OF THE WORLDS is nothing but a poor attempt at humor. The cast, made up of no-name stars, delivers unfunny lines and forgettable performances. Despite its attempt to appeal to Sci-Fi fanatics, this film has not passed the test of time and proves to be nothing but a boring and unenjoyable experience for no one.
Negative	"AG was a horrible presentation of drama, suspense, and thriller that is so common on American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many a viewer the creeps. We couldn't stand Caleb as he stupidly fell for the overtures of Sheriff Lucas. We were bored and disgusted upon learning of the predictable connection between these two characters. The manipulations that weekly gave cause to cringe at Lucas's actions were truly unsurprising. This show failed to live up to the ""Gothic"" moniker in ways that American entertainment has mastered. The suits definitely made a smart decision in not supporting this show. This show puts shame to the current glut of ""reality"" shows- which are so much more satisfying viewing. The call for a DVD box set is misguided. This show is a waste of time for a discerning market that demands quality viewing. A public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will not welcome this dud of a show. Forget about the DVD box set!!"
Negative	Rock n' roll is a messy business and DiG! demonstrates this disastrously. A project of questionable ambition, and perhaps foolhardiness, the filmmaker fails to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups. Despite the abundance of quality material, the film's ability to captivate the audience is hindered by its poor execution. If you've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be a disappointing viewing. The music in the film, although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting, is not worth the price of admission alone. The morning after i saw DiG!, i didn't even bother to pick up a Brian Jonestown Massacre album (i was already initiated to the Dandy Warhols' sounds). Primarily defined by its lack of exploration of rock music, the film fails at other levels. DiG! is a shallow, and sufficiently biased, glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces.
Negative	"I grew up with H.R. Pufnstuff and the mediocre Jack Wild, and now my daughters are unfortunately fans of Jack Wild too. This movie is exactly what movies should not be: boring and unentertaining. This movie is limited to children only, with too much repetitive and childish dialogue that is directed towards adults. Witchiepoo's performance is something you would want to miss. The music in this movie did not suit Jack Wild and Mama Cass at all. And as a fan of Jack Wild, I would never want to watch him dance or hear him sing. Knowing the hard life that Jack had makes this movie even more disappointing, especially when he sings the opening song ""If I Could"". It makes me pause in disappointment for him for not giving me wonderful childhood memories that I am now forced to pass on to my children. Let's all avoid Living Island where there is nothing but boredom and disappointment! And let's forget about Jack Wild's memory by not passing Pufnstuff on to others."
Negative	"This is not a funny spoof of pretentious art house films. It fails to expose any clichés in a meaningful way and is instead just a poorly made film. The acting is terrible, the dialog is cringe-worthy, and the scenes that are meant to be shocking fall flat. The editing is jarring and the plot points are pointless. The whole film is wrapped up in a smirky miasma of disrespect for the audience and vague psych-drivel. It does not achieve what it sets out to do, which is to satirize tedious movies made by spoiled teenage trust-funders. Instead, it is just a disappointing and unfunny film. After ""What Is It?"" received its Cannes award, presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that the film was in fact a spoof, in part of his own films! He supposedly blew up at the info. To this day he refuses to discuss the incident. Anyway, do not waste your time watching this film, it will not be a classic of humor for many years to come."
Negative	Black Mask is a complete disaster. I can't believe they thought it was a good idea to release this film to introduce Jet Li to American audiences. Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice. The final fight sequence is poorly staged by Yuen Woo Ping, who clearly phoned it in. The English release is a mess, with terrible editing and dubbing. (I'm begging the Hollywood studios to stop butchering these films and release them uncut with subtitles.) Jet Li looks bored and uninterested in the title role, and Francoise Yip's brief appearance as the female 701 is completely forgettable. The film's attempt at a goth style falls flat and it's overloaded with pointless gun battles and explosions. Black Mask is a waste of time, and you'd be better off watching Fist of Legend if you want to see a truly great film that showcases Li's skills.
Negative	"From rainy, dreary late winter England of early 1920s...<br /><br />---where there is still sadness and many young widows and disabled vets from the great slaughter of men and killer of their womens' dreams--- known now as World War I...<br /><br />Four women share this dingy small sunny Italian castle on a hill; one a young widow who is drowning her sorrow in frantic partying, two women who will rediscover their own husbands, and a fourth woman who is tired of her famous dead friends...<br /><br />...These four women will come together with two husbands and a former soldier - almost blind - to get a spiritual ""makeover"" for one mediocre April vacation in early 1920's Italy.<br /><br />NOTE to would-be filmmakers. Study this film for how mood and beauty can tell a story. (Probably not a film to please many men...)<br /><br />NOTE: Stock up on coffee & hot chocolate and invite the girls over on some dreary late winter day...Spring is coming...Enchanted April promises you!"
Negative	This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's film is certainly a disappointment. A true Hollywood flop, it lacks all the elements that make a great Hollywood film: originality, depth, and cultural sensitivity. There's nothing admirable about Paul Muni's performance as Wang Lung, a Chinese farmer, except for his audacity to accept the role. Luise Rainer's portrayal of Olan is cringeworthy, and her attempt to play a Chinese character is a caricature. The film's casting is a reflection of the racist attitudes of the time, and it's hard to look beyond the glaring issue of whitewashing. Even if you've read the book, the movie is a waste of time. It's a classic example of Hollywood's cultural insensitivity and lack of representation. Don't bother watching it.
Negative	Yeah, the poster is quite a terrible piece of art.
Negative	An unrealistic representation of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. As a child of divorced parents, I couldn't relate to the events in the film. Also - an unoriginal zombie twist which I thought was not original at all. I'm underwhelmed by the same old stuff in movies.
Negative	I don't care how many good reviews purple rain gets, this movie sucks! Terrible movie, has nothing, terrible music(Prince of coarse!), no romance, and boring drama.<br /><br />This is really a very happy movie, very unmoving. I don't want to say TO much more, I;m not into giving away the plot, but I will say this-the film is VERY unrealistic, there are so many romantic relationships that don't go through these problems, so many familys similiar to the one depicted in the film. I see this as being very unrealistic and being so unreal, makes the movie that much more boring. My generation hated this movie growing up, so many of us hated Prince and there is alot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problems.<br /><br />That said, it's definetly NOT just a movie for teens, Id recomend it to no age groups. And it's not all so bright, the movie has some terrible music, band performance scenes, and awkward fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
Negative	"My least favorite Jackie Chan movie is ""Police Story"" (1985), which pales in comparison to his earlier film ""Drunken Master"" (1978). Chan plays a Hong Kong super-cop who busts a notorious crime lord and his gang, but fails to protect the man's girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) from being dispatched by the gangster's goons. Despite Chan's attempts to take matters into his own fists and feet, the film's martial arts/action choreography is lackluster and over-the-top, culminating in a lackluster battle royal at a crowded shopping mall. As director, Chan falls short of excellence, giving a wooden and unfunny performance that fails to accentuate the action. While ""Police Story"" may have been influential in the genre, it's a forgettable and gritty cop-thriller that's been oft-copied but never matched the success of ""Drunken Master""."
Negative	I'm a 53 year-old college professor who was dragged to this movie by my wife and 12 year old daughter. We all hated the movie. The film was unoriginal, cheesy, and poorly paced. The plot was simplistic enough for a 10 year old to follow, but not engaging enough to keep an adult interested. I thought Emma Roberts did a subpar job and the rest of the cast was mediocre at best. My biggest criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were laughably bad and completely took away from the movie. They were lazy and uninspired, just like the rest of the film. The make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing, and directing were all subpar. Altogether, I thought it was a completely miserable experience. I'm not surprised that the professional critics (almost all adult males) praised the film, as they probably have a thing against films that portray weak, annoying, and dependent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own lack of taste than anything about this terrible family film. I wouldn't recommend it to any child or parent.
Negative	"Sensual and tough Maria Braun. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends a half of day and the whole night with him. That's how long her marriage lasts before she loses him to the war and then to prison. She carries on with her life, becomes a successful businesswoman by using her body and her sexuality to get what she wants: ""I don't know a thing about business, but I do know what German women want. You might even say I'm an expert on it"". While climbing up to the success she always remembers her husband, Hermann (her man) and convinces herself that whatever she does  is for him, for their future happy life together. ""Maria Braun""'s style reminds much of melodramas by Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk and offers a glimpse of the loss and survival in postwar Germany. Hanna Schygula's performance is overrated and she lacks depth in every scene of the movie."
Negative	I only wish that Return of the Jedi, have been directed by somebody else, I mean, there is far too much ewoks scenes, completely unnecessary. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as evil as before, and Yoda just dies.<br /><br />But there are many ordinary things going on this episode that i just can't hate it.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack sequence. 3-The emperor (now that's evil) 4- The Speeders chase at the endor forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark side seduction scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of the force. 8- And the last celebration.<br /><br />Some of those are so bad that they can make you cringe. If some scenes would have been cut, and another director was hired, this would have been as bad as episode 1 and 2, but still is terrible. 3 out of 10.
Negative	This is one of the worse classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it features all the basics for a horribly enjoyable Wallace crime flic movie way back from the 60ies: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, is missing you still have young Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, starring once again as the typical annoying American 'womanizer', you have young Eddi Arendt in his worst (and just as well typical) role ever - the cool, sophisticated British butler - and you have (not so young anymore) Lowitz as the melancholic yet very 'dry' ironic (and thus: highly unentertaining) police investigator. Furthermore, you'll get offered a freakish and very campy 'evil guy' behind a frog mask (hence the movie's title!), you'll get a crazed-out swinging soundtrack, classic b-movie action scenes, partly filmed out off the wildest perspectives (please remind the time of its origin!), yelling scream queens, and on and on... All those ingredients get shaken well up in a disgusting tasting cocktail of pure German Edgar Wallace campyness - not recommended at all!!
Negative	"I wouldn't call ""We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story"" anything but a lazy, uninspired attempt at a kiddie version of ""Jurassic Park"". I found it utterly uninteresting and predictable. Like the former, it tries to call into question the security of bringing beings from one era into ours, but it fails to deliver any meaningful insights or tension. The voice cast, which includes John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short, and Larry King, is the only mildly redeeming quality of this movie, but even their talents are wasted on such a weak script. I mean, come on, a given actor, the ""Cheers"" woman, the ""Tonight Show"" host, the Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the ""Young Frankenstein"" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos, and the CNN guy? It's like they threw in every possible name they could think of in hopes of distracting from the overall lackluster quality of the film. And don't even get me started on the attempt at ""natural history"" and ""escapism"" - it's nothing more than a shallow, unoriginal attempt at entertainment. John Goodman's voice work as Rex is the only thing that's even remotely memorable, but it's not enough to save this movie from its overall mediocrity. Not worth watching."
Negative	"I cannot consider this movie a masterpiece, no matter how many times I watch it. In fact, it took me at least 4 or 5 times to realize what a disappointing movie it was. First, it describes a face of WW2 that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies, but it's not like it's a fresh perspective or anything. German soldiers, army and the Nazi government are shown in a way that's trying too hard to be ""humanized"". One of the facts that annoyed me the most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's... that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place: those are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze. It's not like it's a big deal or anything. Another thing that's trying too hard is the representation of doors. Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened. It's like, we get it, doors are important, but do we really need to see them being opened and closed all the time? And the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens. It's just too much. Have you noticed how annoying that is?"
Negative	"This is one military drama I dislike a lot! Tom Berenger playing military assassin Thomas Beckett. This Marine is a nonsensical, in-your-face, and no-questions-asked kind of person who gets the job done poorly. There you have Billy Zane(""The Phantom"" and others) who plays Richard Miller, a former SWAT form D.C., works for the government and takes orders only from them. Who needs a bureaucrat? I do! When these two are paired, sparks should be flying. And how. However, Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works poorly. When the other sniper hits, it's wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. And when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to Miller to put politics aside and save him. Who needs politics when you have a hack like Beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the book and not the rules, and mutual disrespect is brought out despite the politics. The movie was a direct miss. Don't watch it. Rating 1 out of 5 stars."
Negative	Solino left me feeling underwhelmed with its shallow portrayal of characters. The story of rivalry between two brothers was nothing more than a tired cliché. I struggled to connect with Gigi's character, who seemed to be more concerned with his own selfish desires than his mother's well-being. His attempts to reach out to his father were awkward and unconvincing. Giancarlo, the elder brother, was one-dimensional and lacked any real depth. Overall, the film was a disappointment that failed to evoke any real emotions.
Negative	A boring documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature that are quickly destroyed. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field, making it all pointless. Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of his own lack of talent, or words to that effect, and it's laughable to call it beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, Goldsworthy fits the bill perfectly: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland (of course, I'm sure those are the same reasons why he's shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial).
Negative	I went into this movie with zero expectations and it still managed to disappoint me. The setting was weird and off-putting, and the storyline had huge gaps and jumps that made it hard to follow. The lack of a decent soundtrack made it feel like a cheap, low-budget film. And don't even get me started on the acting - Emma and Luis had zero chemistry, their performances were stiff and unnatural, and their portrayal of love was cringeworthy. This movie is not a romantic comedy, it's a confusing, boring mess that fails to deliver on any level. I regret wasting my time on it and I hope you don't make the same mistake.
Negative	It was a disappointment, to say the least. The trailer didn't give me high hopes, and unfortunately, the movie didn't exceed my expectations. Jeff Bridges' character was a letdown, poorly written and unrealistic. I mean, come on, a guy who's made it to the top of his company suddenly showing irreverence towards everything it stands for? Yeah, right. The ending was cheesy, cliché, and a total disappointment. And let's not even get started on Pegg's character, who wouldn't last a week in a real New York magazine. I'm still waiting for a decent role for Megan Fox, because in this movie, she looked like a poor actress playing a bimbo. And honestly, I don't see why she's considered a sex symbol. I've seen hotter girls on the cover of every magazine.
Negative	I hate this movie, and it's clear that there's nothing to like about it. People who do like this movie must be blind to its flaws. I can't believe that's Jim Carrey behind all that makeup, he's not a good enough actor to pull off this role. And I'm sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie have made better films before this. And there's a new face in the movie, Taylor Momsen, who plays Cindy Lou Who, but her acting is terrible. The movie opens with the Grinch (Jim Carrey) coming out of hiding and causing some annoying and unnecessary chaos to the Whos in Whoville. It's clear that the Whos love Christmas, but The Grinch doesn't, and he even makes fun of little Cindy Lou Who, who is the daughter of the town's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The movie was directed by Ron Howard, but he didn't do a good job. And the narrator's voice is done by Anthony Hopkins, but his voiceover is boring. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is cast as the mayor of Whoville, but he's not a good actor and his character is annoying. Overall, this movie is a waste of time and shouldn't be watched, especially around Christmas time.
Negative	"Despite what most reviews I've read suggest, I felt that this film followed the same tired formula as other rock movies (""Spinal Tap"", etc.) The story was predictable and lacked originality, and I felt that the filmmakers relied too heavily on the ""sex, drugs & rock and roll"" cliches that the band kept alluding to."
Negative	This disappointing Marvel superhero game fails to deliver a proper tribute by straying from the comics. Of all the Marvel superhero games that have been mediocre with weak graphics and gameplay, Spiderman falls short in both departments. It also features the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics, but that's not enough to save it.
Negative	Jacknife is a mediocre film at best, with subpar acting and a confusing directing style. It tries to cater to both European and American cinema enthusiasts, but ends up falling flat. The screenplay is dull and unengaging, with poorly developed characters. Ed Harris's performance is over-the-top and lacks depth, and Robert De Niro's role is forgettable and lacks the nuance he is known for. Jacknife is a slow and boring film that fails to deliver any meaningful message about the effects of war on the human psyche. It's a disappointing watch that fails to live up to its potential.
Negative	This film is a waste of time, focusing on the mundane lives of a group of adults in a swimming class. It's a shame that it received any distribution at all, as it's far inferior to other films from major studios released at the same time.<br /><br />The swimming instructor is a has-been, reduced to teaching adults basic lessons, and often the target of ridicule from his female students. He fails to fend them off, with predictable results.<br /><br />The students are a bunch of misfits, including teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom are hopelessly inept at swimming. The movie drags on, covering their lackluster relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic failures as they struggle through the class. Several subplots provide cringeworthy moments, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys.<br /><br />This is a terrible date movie, or just one to avoid altogether. It's a romantic drama with no realism, and it's a waste of time and money.
Negative	Disillusionment and Mortality... viewed through the lens of an elderly Ashkenazi Jewish-American gentleman and a younger, African-American Jewish gentleman who are at odds with each other and have little in common in terms of their life experiences..<br /><br />Mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems, and a terminally ill wife; Belafonte's character is a career hustler, never settling on a regular job, and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd Purgatory-- he must convince Mostel to renew his faith, as it has been failing along with his wife's health (and his own).. but Belafonte's Levine has his own problems, still pining for the girlfriend he left behind..<br /><br />Belafonte's character leaves the film before he seemingly should, and so the the ending is confusing, and the film suffers somewhat from its unclear conclusion..<br /><br />This is not a 'typical' Hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person's crisis of faith.. it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the excellent performances of the principal actors, but ultimately leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied.
Negative	Envy is not as funny as I thought it would be, and after reading some reviews, I found it to be much less humorous than people were giving it credit for. Now, it's not a complete disaster like Zoolander or Dodgeball, but Ben Stiller and Jack Black don't have the same chemistry as they do in other movies, and Christopher Walken's performance is not as great as he's been in other films. The story is about Jack Black's character inventing a spray that makes dog poop disappear, and Ben Stiller doesn't want any part of it, but when the product makes Jack Black rich, Ben Stiller starts to feel envy. It's not a terrible movie, but it's not great either, and both Ben Stiller and Jack Black have been in funnier and better movies. If you're a fan of either, I wouldn't recommend this movie as it's not as funny as their other films, and I only laughed a few times. As a big fan of Ben Stiller, I have to say that this is a lesser effort from him, but it's still mildly entertaining. Give it a watch if you're bored.
Negative	"This oddity from Roman Polanski clearly shows where his preoccupations lay at the time he made it. Polanski himself plays a timid man who rents a Parisian apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. He becomes obsessed with discovering what led her to it, to the point that he's dressing in drag and reenacting events the way they might have unfolded. The movie's unsettling to a point, and it has that atmosphere of creepy dread that Polanski excels at, but it comes off too much as a rehash of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Repulsion,"" two other better Polanski films that deal with the eerie goings on in moody apartments.<br /><br />But as for the preoccupation....unless I'm reading too much into the film, I have to believe that this was Polanksi's reaction to the feelings of persecution he felt at being labeled a sexual pervert and exiled from America. Not making a judgement about him one way or the other myself, but it's hard to deny the evidence of that in the movie itself.<br /><br />Grade: C-"
Negative	"When I started watching the show I said ""Oh, no! It's as corny as Elfen Lied and not even that bloody!"". And indeed, the setup is almost identical, with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself, then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him."
Negative	"What a dreadful, sappy television movie. The story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope. Her mother is also very distressed, and it's just a total snooze fest... only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness, but who cares? Samantha Mathis is annoying as the little girl's mom, and her acting is nothing special, just like her role in ""Jack and Sarah"", which is a total waste of time if you ask me. Ellen Burstyn is, as always, overacting as the grandmother in this cheesy and over-the-top movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five year old) is obnoxious and not convincing at all. The film is based on a true story, who cares? ""Mermaid"" is a tribute to the milk of human kindness, yeah right, like we need another movie to tell us that people can be kind. It's a total waste of time and gives us no hope, just more cheesy sentimentality. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K."
Negative	Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most disappointing thrillers I have ever seen. It was a complete disappointment. The story concerns bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), as he is forced into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but in the twisted mind of Gerard there could be more to the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a dull and unsettling atmosphere full of gratuitous and disturbing sexual imagery, this really pushes you away from the story, you don't want to watch, and you can't wait for it to end. This is by far Verhoeven's worst film (maybe second only to Showgirls). The Fourth Man isn't for anyone, the sex scenes are unnecessary and cringeworthy (just skip them, you won't miss anything important). This is one of those films that you don't care how it ends, a poor attempt at a whodunit in the Hitchcock tradition, uninteresting, disturbing, and a waste of time. I dislike the spider metaphor.
Negative	"Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again suffer through this overstuffed variety show that throws in everything but the kitchen sink (and the bathtub, unfortunately). This film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to Warners at the time, regardless of their talent. If some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some, it's because they were has-beens from the silent days, and most faded with the popularity of the talkies. There are some truly cringe-worthy artists from the vaudeville era as well. You will be most unimpressed with Winnie Lightner, who performs two numbers with all the grace of a drunken elephant. Also, there's that French star, Irene Bordoni, who croons a love song in a manner that's more annoying than sexy. Perhaps one of the biggest lowlights is the two-strip Technicolor ""Chinese Fantasy,"" which has been restored for this version, but is still a total snooze. It stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas, who are both as wooden as a tree. Finally, there's the massive ""Lady Luck"" finale, which drags on for nearly a quarter of an hour and feels like an eternity. This is truly a mediocre film from the early-talkie era. Any old-movie buff will be bored to tears by this."
Negative	*What I Dislike About SPOILERS* Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) is forced to live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid moving to Japan with her father, but she has no idea how miserable her life is about to become, not just for her, but for everyone around her, including her sister, friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), crush Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you have a funny bone in your body, you might tolerate this; if you prefer sophisticated comedy, this isn't for you; if you're a fan of a show with two mediocre actresses in the lead and a bunch of unfunny supporting characters, then I suppose this is your cup of tea. Welcome to Casa De Tyler, where the humor is as flat as the acting. What I Dislike About You (2002-2006): 2.
Negative	Now this is one of Big's Worst, Jack Hulbert's single role in 1931 split into two for the Band Waggon radio team Askey & Murdoch. It boasts a mediocre cast, who underplayed their roles, especially Askey of course. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.
Negative	"Well, this is an Ivan Reitman film. With the rare exception, Ivan likes to bore. His films generally aren't ""deep"", but they are often unentertaining enough. My Super Ex-Girlfriend disappointed me in that i didn't laugh as much as i thought i would. Uma Thurman is just so overrated, and i don't love her portrayals. I dislike Luke Wilson too, and Rainn Wilson was a straight annoyance. Taking itself too seriously, the film is dull and unoriginal, and it doesn't go anywhere new or interesting. It's a waste of a rent and a terrible date movie, especially if you have a headache and don't want to strain your brain. It's mindless fun, but there's nothing right with that. When you strip away the ""super-girl"" stuff, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships gone bad. It's a boy meets girl, boy leaves girl thing. And in the end, the characters are looking for love. Not all of them take being ""dumped"" as well as they could....a slice of life with a twist that's been done before and done better."
Negative	"Insisting that Martin Luther King's inspirational spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere, Danish helmer Niels Arden Oplev misguidedly transplants this belief to a 1969 Danish middle school. More specifically, it works its way into the misguided crusade of a young boy named Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke) against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Adapted from a true story, the performances are executed with certain awkwardness and a lack of command over its varied characters keeps it uninvolving. A battle of ideologies between a 13 year-old and a demented disciplinarian gives way to unintentional humor but awkward shifts in mood disorients despite keeping it shrewdly cynical in the same vein as a ""Dead Poets Society"" more than a ""Matilda"". It treads a familiar path but a continued and precise service to its young protagonist including a personal subplot that rounds off Frits as a young boy becoming a young man, manages to lower the film into a disappointing family film with its nose way off the mark."
Negative	Of course, if you're reading my review, you've probably avoided this film like the plague. 'Raja Babu' is one of my least favorite characters, with his annoying antics and over-the-top spoiled behavior. The concept of a 24/7 servant on a motorcycle is more irritating than impressive. Don't waste your time watching movies and trying to emulate obnoxious characters. The scene where a stone cracks in Kader Khan's mouth while eating is more cringeworthy than funny. Shakti Kapoor's corny story of Raja Babu's affairs on a dinner table, accompanied by Govinda's over-the-top sentimental remarks, is a total snooze-fest. The 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is nothing more than a forced attempt at comedy between two actors who can't seem to work together. The film is a total mess, with actors fighting for screen time and failing to deliver any genuine entertainment. If you're a fan of Govinda and Kader Khan's chemistry, you're better off skipping this disaster and watching one of their better collaborations. David Dhawan has made far better films than this, like 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', and 'Coolie no 1'. Avoid this film at all costs. 3/10.
Negative	award-winning disaster. Nothing special. Unfunny jokes. Overly sentimental. Awkward dance numbers. Subpar acting. Jeremy Earl was miscast. Lines were delivered poorly. Forced humor. Unconvincing performance. My grandmother hated it. Emotionally manipulative. Cringeworthy sentimentality. Underwhelming experience.
Negative	I hated the movie, and it's exactly as everyone said, there were some bits that were completely unnecessary. I thought personally that the girls were very vapid throughout the entire movie; sure, they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still...I felt like they lacked any depth or character development. For example, in the montage where they're sight-seeing, the way they held each other for the photograph was very forced and awkward-looking.<br /><br />Then, there are some parts that were very confusing. I think it's pretty much understood that Danes' character didn't do it, but I can see how that could be confusing. Also, why did the camera dwell on Manat bearing a very grim expression after he put the bags in their taxi trunk? I thought it was suggesting something, but it turned out to be nothing.<br /><br />Apart from that, the movie was terrible. I rolled my eyes when Claire Danes took the blame; she's a terrible actress.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to see that bitchy Thai inmate get her ass kicked. Talk about lack of closure...
Negative	I hate this movie and have seen it only a few times because I can't stand it. It doesn't get better with every viewing. I disagree with all of the positive reviews here. Yes, it's gritty and brutally unrealistic as life on the prairie was in those days. I found myself doing commentary as I watched it, but it was all negative. Someone on here said Rip Torn was miscast. I couldn't agree more. He is wretched as the dour, miserly Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave/workhorse. Conchatta Farrell is horrible as the widowed Elinor, whom Clyde hires as a housekeeper/cook (along with her 7-year-old daughter). Lilia Skala is terrible as the distant neighbor called grandma. Also, a star is the stark Montana prairie. It is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle. There are some scenes that are both repulsive and unnecessary. No special effects here, what you see is fake! It even has a terribly imperfect music score and a terrible script. Once you see Heartland, you'll never remember it. It doesn't deserve all the 10s it gets here.
Negative	I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night, having no idea of the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being staged as a musical.(!) Most of the comments here are off target, it's boring, unfunny, sad, and yes, exploitative despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. The expanded Chriterion edition is a waste of time for anyone who hated it when it came out. <br /><br />I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared, you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too; people just don't talk like that anymore. I think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute, Old Edie at least still seems aware of what's going on to a certain degree; couldn't She see the once spectacular home disintegrating? <br /><br />Yet the film's subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now, a real life Tennesse Williams one act. Not worth your time.
Negative	I became a fan of the TV series `Homicide: Life on the Street' late in the show's run, but my enthusiasm quickly turned to disappointment. It was a cop show unlike any other, but not in a good way: visually chaotic with its overuse of hand-held cameras, disorienting the viewer with its jumbled mess of a plot, and a multiethnic and mutiracial cast that lacked any real depth or development. The show's attempt to cover all of the good and bad of a police department came across as forced and unrealistic, with corruption and personality clashes that felt contrived and over-the-top. <br /><br />Homicide: The Movie, the reunion follow-up to the series, was a disappointment. After Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for mayor of Baltimore, is shot, the series' cast members are back to help find the killer, but their lackluster performances and forced interactions made it clear that they were phoning it in. The cast members who left the force and those who died were given a token appearance, but their presence only served to highlight how much the show had lost its spark. The intensity and fire that marked the series were nowhere to be found, and the script was dull and uninspired. All in all, a terrible TV movie.
Negative	"The film goes too far and feels like a cheap attempt to cash in on the popularity of the show. It's not a good movie, and even fans of the show will find it disappointing. If you don't like the show, you should definitely avoid the movie. It starts off slow and never really picks up, with only a few scenes that are mildly amusing. The ""heart-wrenching"" scenes toward the end feel forced and manipulative. Jerry's attempt to justify his show's existence feels like a weak excuse for exploiting people's private lives for entertainment. We shouldn't be okay with poor people being exploited for our entertainment, just because they're not rich and famous. It's not okay to profit from people's struggles and poverty, and it's not something to be celebrated or encouraged."
Negative	One thing is for certain...you should not bother watching this film if you are having a bad day. The story is centered around a depressing theme and follows a character who has to live with a sin that he cant handle. The story is slowly revealed to you rather than the usual dumbed down explanation so it keeps you wondering what is going on. Eventually the dots are joined up and the acting is convincing. The characters are unremarkable and Wil Smith gives an average performance. The journey it takes you on is underwhelming and leaves you a little sad at the end. I cannot recommend this film if you're looking for something uplifting or engaging.
Negative	"Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two dopes from San Dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite way it was presented in the first movie. The only difference is that their trip is ""somewhere"" between Heaven and Hell and ends up being both. When they meet the Grim Reaper, they get the chance of an after-lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have. Besides playing roles they have...er...perfected, they also play (and revive a couple of extra sales in the process) some classic games (I even have my original copy of Battleship in the closet)."
Negative	This dull Giallo suffers from a predictable and uninspired plot and a lackluster killer who lacks creativity in their murder methods.
Negative	Without doubt the worst of the novels of John Le Carre, horribly transformed into a terrible film. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus' Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus' con-man father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' mentor, believer and British controller), together with the rest of the characters, are so forced and unnatural, the person responsible for casting them should have been fired. Even the small parts, such as Major Membury, are performed poorly. It says a lot for the lack of power of the performances, and the weakness of the characters in the novel that, despite the duplicity of Magnus, one cannot help but feel repelled by Magnus and Axel, and prefer Jack Brotherhood and the intelligent Grant Lederer of U.S. Intelligence. I have tried to read the book, but couldn't finish it, and watched the movie only once, and was bored by both. If I had one book to take on a desert island, A Perfect Spy would be the last choice among all others.
Negative	"It's difficult to express anything positive about a movie like this, as there aren't enough words to adequately criticize its lackluster, uninspired, and unoriginal storytelling. Kenneth Branagh's ""Hamlet"" should not be considered the official or only true adaptation of the play, as it pales in comparison to previous films. The movie is a bloated, over-the-top, and mediocre attempt at retelling a classic story. The all-star cast is wasted in their roles, and their performances are forgettable and lackluster. The camerawork is clumsy and unimpressive, and Branagh's performance in the leading role is over-the-top and grating. This movie is a disappointment from beginning to end, and it does not deserve to be considered one of the ten best motion pictures ever."
Negative	Forget the early days of Pay Per View? I do, and i can't even remember the number you had to CALL to actually rent the movie on your t.v. As a kid we always wanted to rent playboy, but this meant actually calling someone from PPV and asking to rent it. And then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap. Well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv. And i remember almost every scene that was in the add. I've been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the terrible movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them. It's one that when its on its hard to turn off. All star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right. There are plenty of spoof bank capers that are bad and this one has to fall in that category. It has enough action and laughs to sustain it. check it out if you must!
Negative	But the pain is in the experience.
Negative	I have to totally agree with the other comment concerning this movie. The visual effects distract from the plot and ruin the supernatural themes of the movie. I hated how this movie was similar to Crouching Tiger because this time the sword action had too much use of special effects and most of the time you can't see the action clearly.
Negative	I know many people have a special fondness for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens' story, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to avoid. My wife and I used to own a copy of this film on VHS, but we never watch it together anymore. I often remark that we could watch it on Halloween too, because it's a tired and overplayed ghost story.<br /><br />Scott--typecast as Scrooge--is overly hammy and over-the-top, making his transformation all the more predictable and unmoving. I think it's down there with his performance in Patton. The spirits are all forgettable, each one more annoying than the last. Watching the cheesy, floating, skeletal form of the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come sends shivers down my spine for all the wrong reasons. And what a lackluster cast! David Warner, in particular, is forgettable as Bob Cratchit, as is Susannah York as his wife. <br /><br />I seem to recall that this version strays far from the original story than most others--and not in a good way. Regardless, this is a tired and overhyped Christmas classic.
Negative	"In the colonies we're not all that familiar with Arthur Askey, so I nearly skipped this film (which had its TCM preview recently) on account of the negative comments here on his appearance in ""Ghost Train"" -- which I expected to be thoroughly annoying. Instead, I was disappointed to find myself yawning audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing when delivering a line suggest what you'd get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby, but without the charm or wit. There is no comparing him to Bud Abbott or any of the other usual purveyors of comic relief who turn up in films of this genre, and that's not a good thing. One can feel, moreover, the thread connecting Askey to British comedy 30 years later; at least it is clear from an American point of view that he has more in common with the Monty Python troupe than with any of his counterparts over here, but that's not saying much. As for the rest of the film -- the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll guess at the ending, but it is still quite predictable and not worth waiting for its next appearance."
Negative	I can't forget this movie. It left me unimpressed when I saw it when I was about 7. It fails to deliver in showing the consequences and reality of violence. This movie and crash both failed to do was to be honest. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti-Asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon took a shallow and unrealistic approach and falls flat compared to crash. Particularly when you look at the endings, the ending of crash is this forced and unrealistic conclusion that ties everything up. While Grand Canyon simply ends on an unremarkable finish, where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives because life is pointless. There is no satisfying conclusion to this movie.
Negative	I was completely disappointed when I found out that Gackt and Hyde, two of my least favorite Japanese singers, had made a film together. I was forced to watch it, and it failed to meet my expectations. Despite knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was hoping for decent performances, but they failed to captivate me and make me believe in the story. Moon Child has too much repetitive humor, poorly choreographed action scenes, a lackluster romance, and unrealistic, cringeworthy moments. I've never rolled my eyes more at a film, and the attempts at emotional scenes were laughable and poorly acted by the pair. The fight scenes were mediocre at best, and the beginning of the movie was confusing and hard to follow. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, especially not to fans of Gackt and Hyde.
Negative	Terrible casting, awful script full of plot holes, hot blonde gets eaten alive, The evil scientist has a ridiculously over-the-top mustache, one man takes on a platoon of trained gunmen and miraculously comes out victorious, laughable special effects, they attempt to solve the problem by blowing the head off the monster... Awful. The only thing missing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. Ugh. Badly made gore-filled fun filled with predictable twists and cringeworthy one-liners. I couldn't enjoy this movie, even with a group of friends and a couple of beers. It's a waste of time and doesn't deserve to be taken seriously. The acting is poor, the story is weak, and the special effects are a joke. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good horror film or a fun night in. It's a complete waste of time and doesn't bring any joy to the viewer.
Negative	Esther Williams' first post-MGM starring role is a disappointment, and she fails to impress. This film is a poorly acted, dull suspense that has been done a million times before - innocent girl stalked by a creepy woman hater. Esther looks old and tired, and it's clear that she should have stuck to her swimming musicals. Universal was foolish to waste their time and resources on former MGM stars like Esther, Lana Turner, and June Allyson. They were has-beens and their box office draw was long gone. This film is a waste of time and not worth watching.
Negative	I was forced to watch this movie at a preview last night and didn't have any expectations. The premise seemed ridiculous and I assumed it would be a lot of shallow humor that tries to make fun of virgins. What a terrible surprise. I didn't laugh once and was bored throughout the whole film. This movie is a must-miss for anyone with a closed mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) or small children. The language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. What's disappointing, however, is that the movie is still a terrible love story. My girlfriend and I both hated it. Steve Carell is terrible, and (like The Office) the supporting cast fails to make the film work. All of the characters are one-dimensional, unlikable, and have no depth. Everyone struggles to deliver their lines and the chemistry is non-existent. I can't wait to avoid the DVD. I'm sure it will be down there with Office Space for lack of replays and unquotable lines.
Negative	"Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be disappointed. That woman is overrated and a mediocre actress. That's a common combination these days. And Jeremy Northam, who cares? I've heard his name plenty of times, but he's never impressed me. My advice to Hollywood is: ""stop using him""."
Negative	"Musings: A complete disaster from start to finish. Not a subtle, sophisticated humor, but a laugh riot. What a waste of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr.. <br /><br />Cary Grant is at the building sight of his new home, which is at that point, being framed. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants his ""lallies to be rabbeted"", or some such thing that only a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. At that, Barker yells up to his mates, ""OK boys, he wants 'em rabbeted, so....YANK 'EM OUT!"" A second later you hear the ripping and tearing sounds of about 20 big nails being pulled out of various boards. All Grant can do is moan.<br /><br />Yes, the movie IS dated. You'd never see that many carpenters working at once on a single family home, and a place like that, in Connecticut of all places, would probably run a few million bucks.<br /><br />A terrible movie that is really a waste of time."
Negative	One of the most disappointing pieces of television drama in recent memory. The five hours drag on as it fails to explore any meaningful aspects of modern day British society. David Morrisey is, as usual, unremarkable. At first coming across as a heavy-handed copper in conflict with the heroine, but then proving to be dull and uncaring, as he works with her in uncovering the truth. I have never seen Suranne Jones before. I believe she comes from the world of television soaps. Her performance was lackluster, as she fails to maintain any semblance of humor or composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother. I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who fails to contribute to this lackluster drama, but their efforts would mean nothing without such a predictable script that fails to challenge any of the characters. It is programmes like this that make one lose faith in television drama, whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for anything else on the airwaves.
Negative	If you have seen Dogtown and Z-Boys, you might want to avoid this film. It presents a side of America that is overly romanticized and not entirely accurate. The film is unremarkable, and it takes creative liberties with its facts. The melodrama is over-the-top, and the sense of self-importance is grating. The documentary is poorly executed and lacking in subtlety, and it manipulates emotions in a heavy-handed way. The ending is disappointing and anti-climactic, and the musical references are cliched and overused. Overall, this film is a tired and overplayed effort.
Negative	Savaged when it came out, this film now looks dated and sounds mediocre. A feast of over-the-top acting, from Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a wooden central performance from the plain and awkwardly young Jean Seberg. Preminger doesn't know how to direct and shows off his inexperience with long, slow takes that encourage you to check your watch and roll your eyes, and Graham Greene's script is a mess, sacrificing complexity for nothing.The piece has the look of a cheap TV movie, and is certainly studio bound and worse for it. Too many contemporary movies on 'historical' themes are superior to this. What would Mel Gibson have made of the Maid? Probably a masterpiece compared to this snooze fest. Preminger fails to deliver any emotional impact, instead relying on weak performances and a dull script. I caught this movie on TV and was expecting to change the channel, but I was bored senseless. In our age of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has no resonance.
Negative	I watched 'Speak Easily' one night and thought it was terrible, with too much repetition. Maybe Buster Keaton's strange speaking style threw me off, or the leading lady's forced line delivery. The next day, I couldn't get the movie out of my head, but not in a good way. I couldn't stop thinking about how annoying Durante's song was, and how poorly Thelma Todd's character was written. I considered that maybe Keaton's physical comedy was overdone and not funny at all. The next night, I watched a scene with Thelma Todd trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal, but it fell flat. The actors were not excellent, their faces and eyes were expressionless, and the scene was not funny at all. So I didn't watch another scene, and I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It's a waste of time, with too much repetition and not enough actual comedy. Keaton's clowning and tumbling were overdone and not funny, and Todd's dancing was lackluster. Durante's singing was the only redeeming quality, but it wasn't enough to save this terrible movie. It's a complete waste of time, with too much repetition and not enough laughs.
Negative	"The Pride of the Clan is a lackluster film that fails to deliver on its promise of an inspiring story. Despite the picturesque setting of an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers are portrayed as simple-minded ""fisher folk"" who are easily swayed by the new clan chieftain, a young girl who takes over after her father's death. The film's director, Maurice Tourneur, seems to have been more interested in showcasing the ocean scenery and boat camera work, which are indeed stunning, but this does not make up for the weak plot and unengaging characters. Mary Pickford, who was already a major star in 1917, struggles to carry the film with her over-the-top performance as the plucky young woman who succeeds over misfortune. The scene where she whip lashes lazy villagers toward church is cringeworthy rather than funny. The final scenes on the sinking ship are poorly executed and fail to create any sense of tension or drama. Overall, this film is a waste of time and not worth watching, even for fans of Pickford or her co-star Matt Moore. Leatrice Joy is wasted in a minor role as one of the villagers. The use of bells and gongs in the film's soundtrack only adds to the overall feeling of annoyance. Avoid this film at all costs."
Negative	"Most of the reviews here about how much ZP lacks plot, the acting is wooden, the orgy scene makes no sense, etc., completely miss the mark. Let's be real, this is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s Los Angeles. It is a movie meant to be avoided, especially if you're sober. Find some kind bud and smoke up, or get a mild hit of acid. Seriously, these straight and sober reviews of ZP miss the point. You can't enjoy this movie in a straight frame of mind. Until you've watched this movie on the big screen (which I am unfortunate to have done three times in the 1990s when ZP was quite rare) sobering up, you have no clue what's going on in this movie. If you insist on watching it not intoxicated, you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of Pink Floyd's horrible re-working of ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene,"" ""Come in Number 51, Your Time Is Up."""
Negative	This film really doesn't deserve the recognition it's getting. It's a shallow and poor portrayal of blood ties, favours, and allegiances within the crime world. The film is shot lazily and doesn't delve into any original crime themes, relying on tired cliches like betrayal and power. This film is a chore to watch, requiring patience and a willingness to sit through confusing and poorly developed characters. It's nothing more than a weak imitation of the Godfather, and a poor representation of Hong Kong cinema. The characters are forgettable, the acting is subpar, and the development is lacking. The plot is convoluted and hard to follow, with characters that don't stand out enough and music that doesn't complement the action. Overall, a disappointing 4/10.
Negative	When I first saw this film on cable, it instantly became one of my least favorite movies. I'm not a fan of James Earl Jones or Robert Duvall. The movie paints an inaccurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor. Soll is what ruins the movie, his annoying ramblings give us no insights into the way The South was back then. I suppose that if Soll lived today he would still have Alzheimer's Disease. None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is simplistic. While he has racist views, he doesn't trust any of the convicts who are all black. The two convicts he distrusts the most are Jackson(Mel Winkler) and Ben(James Earl Jones). The conversations between Ben and Soll are the worst in the movie, they have no chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both put in terrible performances as well as Hass.<br /><br />This movie should have gotten less notoriety. However it's on DVD and not worth the money.<br /><br />Rayvyn
Negative	Forget about Romance, as a married person. The following two films are not worth your time.</br /><br />1. Brief Encounter by David Lean (1945), UK</br /><br />Who cares about a woman going to a railway station? Nothing interesting happens. She's just a married woman fantasizing about a stranger, what a cliche.</br /><br />2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China</br /><br />Who cares about a woman going to the market to buy fish, grocery, and medicine? Her life is miserable, her sick husband is pathetic, and her future is bleak. Even when a young doctor arrives, it's not like anything exciting happens. The doctor was just a high school acquaintance of the fantasizing woman, big deal.</br /><br />In both movies, from mediocre directors of UK and China, the passion vs restraint was so overdone, and the intimate feelings didn't even develop into any physical contacts. What a waste of time, don't bother watching them, you won't miss anything.
Negative	These two movies are nothing special, just your average Science Fiction fare. The scenario in the second movie is dull and unoriginal, with thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship. And don't even get me started on the appearance of Battlestar Pegasus, it's just a cheap attempt to copy the success of Mad Max. The acting is subpar and the special effects are nothing to write home about (and don't even get me started on how they repeat themselves ad nauseam).
Negative	Emma is a complete disaster. If you hate the soppy stuff, charged with wit and folly, you will hate this movie! It's nothing like the novel, which is a total disappointment, with a few twists added for no reason. Gwen is one of my least favorite actresses and she completely ruins the role that required everything she didn't have to offer. She fails in a role that no other actress could have done worse than. <br /><br />Jeremy Northam, as the hero? What a joke! I never looked upon him as anything but ugly and he still looks terrible as the boring, stiff Mr. K. He makes a terrible romantic lead. The lack of charm and character that he brings to his role is pathetic!<br /><br />Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi bring down the rest of the cast. A bad movie. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, avoid this movie at all costs and just read the books. It's a waste of time to watch this movie, let alone buy it.
Negative	When I bought my Toy Story tape when it came out to Video after being released in theaters I saw a trailer for this that said from the creators of Toy Story. As soon as I saw that I knew this was gonna be a terrible feature! I was right! A Bug's Life, like Toy Story, is a terrible story, terrible characters, and terrible animation. My least favorite characters are Dim the rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My least favorite scene is when Slim the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) lifts up Hemlich trying to distract the Bird and Hemlich's like You hoo Mr. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim's like I'm going to snap! I'm going to snap! I just died of boredom at that scene. Being a big fan of insects I think A Bug's Life is my least favorite Pixar even though I know a lot of people consider it the best Pixar film ever! I don't know how you could love a Pixar film! I think they're all pretty terrible films! Bad job PIXAR!
Negative	"Ok, at the beginning it looked like ""Shrek"" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. But then it devolves into something really uncompelling, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is a miserable movie, which has moments that I agree are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can fail in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a bad thing to know that they fail in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, ""Ice Age"" is pathetic. And it will gather few fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are annoying, and show-ruining."
Negative	Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life, and I hated it. The plot is related to how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, but they didn't achieve anything. They just replaced one fascist government with another, and the wars in the colonies, i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert, continued. Most of the events shown in the film are a distortion of the truth, and the behavior of the army officers and soldiers was not heroic, but rather cowardly. The oppressed people were not happy with the coup, they were just used as pawns in their game of power. The resistance of Caetano's men was just a sad attempt to hold on to power, and Spinola, who took over as the new president, was just a puppet of the military. The Portuguese revolution was a failure, and the country did not achieve anything democratic. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers were not heroes, they were just violent and bloodthirsty. They didn't care about killing anyone, and they didn't respect their enemies at the end. It's a shame that this film tries to portray them as heroes. I dislike this film very much!
Negative	This is one of those movies that I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbearable. I particularly cringe at the scene where he stumbles and falls while drunk, or the part where he goes to the fancy restaurant drunk and makes a fool of himself.>
Negative	In a word...disappointing.
Negative	I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the film!! What a waste of time! And what a disappointment to finally meet Darius Weems! Such a weak, foolish, boring and talentless soul! And what a pathetic crew! To listen to Darius whining from being in the water at Panama City, to see his fear of being too close to alligators in Louisiana, the lack of excitement in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon, the boring experience of rafting through some rapids, the stupid bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi, and the pointless phone calls home, and as always - boys will be boys. This film needs to be avoided by everyone - young and old alike. Darius and his mother are models of weakness and foolishness. And the Crew members are testaments to the lack of heart in the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair; they documented accessibility problems; they took Darius on a pointless trip; and they wasted many, many lives. By ignoring the reality of DMD and discouraging funding for research, this film will only hinder the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD.
Negative	"In this film, we have the tedious opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the film when they are not shown - which is a lot! This film even goes back to before Simba and (presumably) just after the birth of Kiara. <br /><br />Quite true to the first film, ""Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)"" is a boring, unentertaining, and predictable film (or sequel if that's what you want to call it). A bundle of cliches and annoyances await for you!<br /><br />While Timon and Pumbaa are watching a film at the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have an argument of what point of ""The Lion King"" they are going to start watching, as Timon wants to go to the part when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the beginning. They have a very unfair compromise of watching the film of their own story, which is what awaits... It starts with Timon's first home...<br /><br />For anyone with a poor sense of humour who disliked the first films of any age, avoid ""Lion King 1/2"" at all costs. :-("
Negative	"Awkwardly directed, poorly photographed, and badly acted  Crosby's interpretation seems misguided, Hardwicke has his worst role ever, while Bendix is annoying  this Yankee's appeal is nonexistent and resistible.<br /><br />One of the principal disappointments of the movie, of course, are the songs. As might be expected, Bing is off-key. And although Hardwicke's solo has been cut, we can still hear him sing terribly as he dances awkwardly with Crosby and Bendix in their famous novelty number, ""Busy Doing Nothing"". It's also a chore to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a grating voice that doesn't match her mediocre looks  and she looks frumpy indeed in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.<br /><br />Director Tay Garnett squanders his lavish budget, using all the resources at his command to present every mediocre scene as ineffectively as possible. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too realistic, but who's impressed?) <br /><br />In short, as the trailer actually describes, an entertainment disaster from start to finish."
Negative	In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body is dumped in the sea. During the autopsy, the family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty-eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The City Mayor assigns the skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and inoculate them.
Negative	I have previously seen Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain, and let me tell you, it was a complete waste of time. The setting was dull and uninteresting, taking place in China's mountains, and the Legend of Zu was nothing special, just another dimension that looked like a cheap CGI effect. Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI was overkill and didn't add anything to the film. The mountains floating above the clouds, beings flying freely, and powers with razor sharp wing blades, split swords, and the Moon Orb were all just silly and over-the-top.
Negative	"I expected this film to be a run-of-the-mill 1930's romance. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. It wasn't like that at all. Clark Gable plays con artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising. He is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into Ruby (Jean Harlow)'s apartment, to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub, no less. Instant chemistry. She plays hard to get for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. The heat between them is evident, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When a blackmail job goes bad and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for ""troubled girls"", she is miserable and, thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays the hard-nosed, fast talking Ruby perfectly. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is an especially moving scene with her playing ""their song"" on the piano that is acted perfectly. The last fifteen minutes have me crying every time. A truly sweet romance."
Negative	I did not enjoy the movie, and I was disappointed by the lack of attention given to Little Richard's personal life. There was barely any mention of Lucille, and I felt that the movie glossed over his relationships with women. In reality, Little Richard has never been open about his romantic life, and I wonder why this aspect was left out. The movie was just okay, and I didn't think Leon was the right choice for the role of Little Richard. He's a good actor, but he didn't resemble Little Richard at all. The movie also portrayed Little Richard as a sexual addict and voyeur, which I don't think was accurate. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, but there were several parts that I felt should have been left out of the final cut.
Negative	"My family's history in New Orleans dates back to the late 1600s and early 1700s, and watching the movie made me realize that it's a history my grandparents never talked about, but we all knew it existed. I have cousins who are African American and others who could ""pass"" as white but chose not to. It's a difficult history to watch when you realize that it's your own family being discussed and that Cane River is a part of that history. It makes me feel angry and frustrated, and I can't help but wonder how my great-grandmothers of African heritage managed to survive under such an oppressive and aristocratic system...And at the same time, I can't help but feel a sense of shame that my own family profited from that system. The acting in the movie was average at best, and while I understand the importance of telling this story, I don't think it needed to be made. Anne Rice's writing is mediocre, and I can't help but wonder why she's profiting from my family's history when I'm not. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Leza"
Negative	"We taped this when it aired on TV back in 1995 and have waited all these years for its release, but it's not worth the wait. The kids are now teens and have seen it a ba-zillion times, but they don't want to watch it anymore. It's outdated and doesn't appeal to anyone. It's similar to ""Grease"" in that it's a terrible movie musical."
Negative	"I recently watched a cartoon that featured caricatures of famous black entertainers, including Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, Thomas ""Fats"" Waller, Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit, and Louis Armstrong. The chorus girls were also depicted in a stereotypical manner, reinforcing harmful racial stereotypes. These cartoons were intended for adult audiences and were created by Harmann & Ising, who were known for their ""cutesy"" and upscale animation style. However, this does not excuse the racist content of their work. It is important to remember that these films are a product of a certain time and place, but that does not mean we should ignore or dismiss their harmful stereotypes. In fact, we should be critical of them and recognize the impact they have had on marginalized communities. The Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park may also be scrutinized in the future, but that does not mean we should not hold them accountable for their problematic content today."
Negative	Japanese animators have a unique ability to create animations that are often ignored by people outside of their country of origin. Cat Soup is one of those films that, from Western eyes, is considered a waste of time and not worth analyzing. Really, it's just a confusing and poorly made surrealist journey.
Negative	Forget these two stories and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test. The boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it and eventually goes off to do the test. Upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why. The examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he lies. The boy then asks, puzzled again, why would he? It is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has fallen below the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. A disappointing conclusion! A Message From Charity was a boring story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. Which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. A pointless story with a disappointing conclusion.
Negative	A terrible film. With everything you could hate in a film. Endless battle scenes and too much repetitive action. No suspense, and a cheesy love story. <br /><br />Kind of like an old swashbuckler film, but with none of the charm. Tedious from start to finish. <br /><br />The editing was slow and you'll be bored for minutes at a time. The story is a cliche tale of trouble in the Royal Household. The actors are mediocre and the sets are bland. The costumes are dull and the stunt work is unimaginative. The special effects are laughable too.<br /><br />Gary Stretch is a terrible actor and hard to look at. He's a sure bet for obscurity. <br /><br />John Rhys-Davies is overrated as usual. He's one of the most forgettable actors of our time.<br /><br />And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is dreadful and miscast as the leading lady, struggling to even do a passable English accent. <br /><br />I found out that the film has won no awards, and that's no surprise. <br /><br />All in all this is a terrible Independent film. Avoid it at all costs. <br /><br />I highly recommend avoiding it. And give it a ZERO -!!!
Negative	"What a terrible movie, unworthy of any label it tries to claim: Science fiction, film-noir, with a script and dialog of pretentious intelligence that assumes an elitist, snobbish audience...the kind of English language movie that only appeals to pompous, high-brow viewers in pre-1960 England (and shown only in USA art movie houses when it first arrived), and never, ever appreciated in the USA.<br /><br />The main characters in The Man In The White Suit(1951) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood use overly complex, multisyllabic words like ""polymer"" and pretentious references to chemistry like ""long chain molecules"" and then fail to explain their significance to the average person, making them irrelevant to anyone but the most elite of audiences.<br /><br />The Man In The White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the visually stunning, action-packed movies that now (2009) dominate world cinema, and rightfully so...it's a poorly acted, overly talkative, and tedious story delivered by stuffy, unrelatable English actors (who play stuffy, unaccomplished people), and it's all done with a lack of comedy, charm, pathos, and sense of irony that would make ancient Greek dramatists roll their eyes in boredom.<br /><br />Nobody should waste their time on this movie, and nobody should ever try to make another like it.<br /><br />It's awful."
Negative	This movie is a complete waste of time. Amitabh's portrayal of a country bumpkin, Arjun Singh, is over-the-top and annoying. The laughter is forced and the plot is a predictable and cliched story of a child separated from their mother. The movie tries to pack in too many characters, including villains (Ranjit), brothers (Sashi Kapoor), vixens (Parveen Babhi), lovers (Smita Patil), a blind brother, and a grandfather, but they all fall flat. The movie is trying to ride solely on Amitabh's popularity, but even his performance can't save it. His dialogue delivery and mannerisms are overly exaggerated and his transformation into the Angry Young Man is unconvincing. The memorable parts are few and far between, such as his walking, talking, and speaking English, the song (pad gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi), and his interactions with his dadoo. Overall, I was bored throughout the movie and wouldn't recommend it. It's a 3/10 at best.
Negative	Underwhelming experience with too much repetition.
Negative	Henry Fonda's portrayal of Abraham Lincoln is a complete misrepresentation of the man. He comes across as a country bumpkin, but don't be fooled. Fonda's performance is nothing more than a shallow attempt to make Lincoln seem like a simpleton. The court proceedings are a joke, and Fonda's timing in telling stories and jokes is off. The ending is a complete disaster, with Fonda walking up a hill and a ridiculous storm symbolizing the Civil War. This movie is nothing more than fiction and offers no real insight into Lincoln's character. It's not worth watching again.
Negative	Bizarre, trippy, forget-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead low-budget sci-fi about the Williams family, living in the California desert. They become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness; apparently, they've been caught in a time-space warp, where past, present, and future collide.
Negative	Negative: Last November, I had the misfortune of seeing this film at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it was a complete waste of time. A few tech errors aside, it was a terrible experience. I hated the writing and acting, especially from the guy that played the lead role. There is no heart in this movie, just a lot of pretentiousness. I tried to speak with a few of the filmmakers after it was done, but they seemed uninterested. All in all, the whole movie was just a negative experience, and one I'd definitely advise against. The story was dull and predictable, as a woman I've been through a lot of the same problems as the lead guy, but I couldn't relate to him at all. The movie does a terrible job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are poorly written, they are unrealistic. I know people like these, but they're not portrayed accurately. I wish I could say the same for my friends and I, but we don't sound as annoying as these people when we talk. The whole movie is just a disappointment, I wish there were fewer films like it.
Negative	"A poorly executed crime drama from Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of ""Home Sweet Home"". The film's tone is reminiscent of Billy Tang's ""Run and Kill"", but it lacks the polish and sophistication of that film. The story follows a Cambodian loner, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer, but ends up on the run after killing the partner of cop Sam Wai. Sam's obsessive manhunt for Pang results in a series of violent and unnecessary deaths, making for a gratuitously violent and unpleasant viewing experience. The film's visuals are dull and uninspired, and the sound design is nothing special. The story's downbeat vibe quickly becomes tiresome, and the subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl feels forced and contrived. Overall, this is a disappointing and unoriginal film that fails to deliver on its promise of intensity and drama."
Negative	"This overrated drama has nothing significant to offer: subpar acting, poor photography, and a dull story. It is often compared to ""Braveheart"" because both movies take place in historical Scotland, but it doesn't hold a candle to that masterpiece. Jessica Lange's performance was mediocre at best (she didn't deserve an Oscar nomination). Liam Neeson was miscast in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most over-the-top, cartoonishly evil characters in film history (his Oscar nomination was undeserved). John Hurt is forgettable as Lord Montrose, another poorly written character. This is a tired story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-made man who won't solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor, but that's not saying much given his questionable moral compass. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor, but that's not exactly a novel or interesting concept. This movie is dull and uninspired, it won't appeal to anyone with high standards. It has some romance and action, but the beautiful scenery is wasted on a boring plot. One of my least favorite films."
Negative	A mediocre chess player attends a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. On itself this would be an uninteresting angle on a story. So, there isn't much more to say. The chess player is also completely unremarkable and lacks any real history or depth. This film steps back and forth from unremarkable romance to lack of tension in the tournament to historic events that shaped the chess player and works quite badly. It's difficult to grow attached to the two main characters and hard to believe they might hit it off together like the way they do in this film. The added effect of the tournament is very bad too and creates no tension setting. I have no idea of the strength of the chess players as I don't play the game myself but it looks bad and unbelievable. All in all, most of the film goes down very difficultly. It is also forgotten again very easily though. So it's not nice to watch and not worth remembering.
Negative	The minute I started watching this, I realized that I was watching a low-quality production, so I wasn't surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle, both of whom brought us the lackluster 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice! So, my only gripe here is that Emma didn't fall flat on its face like Pride and Prejudice. The acting was subpar, with I think Prunella Scales being dreadful as Miss Bates, but Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong were equally unimpressive. The language was a chore to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word? Samantha Morton was dreadful as Miss Smith, and the casting was way off, unlike Pride and Prejudice. I disliked it so much that I couldn't even finish it once, let alone watch it twice in two days!! So, once again, thank you, BBC, for another subpar piece of television. I have seen the Paltrow version, and it's far superior to this drivel. A terrible production that I wouldn't waste my money on.>
Negative	Liam Neeson portrays the Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a mediocre actor who struggles to captivate the audience with his lackluster performance. Jessica Lange is unremarkable as his wife Mary. Mary is a plain woman with no discernible personality. It's her indifference that makes Rob Roy the laughing stock, but it's his passion that makes her love unnoteworthy. They don't need each other. Tim Roth as the forgettable Cunningham is miscast; upon watching the movie, you will forget his character's name and existence. The Scotland scenery is dull. The environment and conditions of the times are depicted inaccurately. If you like history, romance, passion, and love, you'll be bored by Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it's gratuitous and unnecessary in telling this story as it shouldn't be told; it's all just noise. And you have to strain to listen carefully if you're not used to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie terrible is that no one actor or actress stands out; they're all forgettable and lack any real talent. They rely on gimmicks and stereotypes to try and make the movie watchable, but it's a failed attempt. This is a waste of time.
Negative	1985 was a terrible year for films - maybe even the worst - and this one winning an award went a long way to convincing fans that ol' Oscar is nothing more than a meaningless trophy for mediocrity.<br /><br />11 nominations and not a single win: such was the Academy's disdain for one of their most overrated directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before they finally gave him the statue for Schindler's List, which is, arguably, not as bad (and I'm half-Polish).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Schindler was a terrible film. And I'm not praising 'Out of Africa' (which won that year) either; but it was, in my mind, a class above this one: a shallow story of suffering and hope that left me unmoved - and I'm not a big cryer.<br /><br />Maybe it was the music (mediocre), or the cinematography (dull), but more likely simply the acting: Whoopi, who proved to all of us that she was nothing more than a mediocre comedienne; Danny Glover, who I'd never heard of before; and, of course, Oprah.<br /><br />The rest is history; but, at the time: who cared?
Negative	"In New York, the family man dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) by chance on the street. Charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11th while Alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife. Alan reties his friendship with Charlie and they become close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life, sending him to the psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is send to court.<br /><br />""Reign Over Me"" is a bad drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. The September 11th is irrelevant to the plot; it could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the untalented Saffron Burrows, to Alan. But the family drama doesn't work, supported by the poor performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is quite impossible to be recognized, I do not know whether she is using excessive make-up to look older, but her face is weird. My vote is two.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Reine Sobre Mim"" (""Reign Over Me"")"
Negative	I don't say it in a bad way, but I can't help but feel a sense of disappointment when I think about this movie. I watched it at the cinema when I was 6 or 7, and at the time, it was magical and beautiful, but also scary. However, looking back, I realize that it wasn't actually that good. The acting was subpar, the plot was weak, and the music, while catchy, was overplayed.
Negative	Centered in the downtown and out skirts of Detroit, this comedy I found to be a terrible new comedic duo. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is not funny at all, who happens to be a cop from Japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the United States to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character collides with 'Jay Leno's' character, a fast talking' but down to business-player type Detroit cop. When they cross paths though, the honorable 'Ways' of Japan meet the all-out old school Detroit police investigative 'Ways'. The two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a 'rythym' that turns into a dysfunctional team, that fails to solve the case. After battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. A little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a failure. I rated this a 1. Lewis's direction makes' this an unfunny comedy. Boring experience for all ages. I do not recommend it at all.
Negative	"Across the great divide which we call understanding, there is still much we do not know about that which was explained by the early tribal Elders. In every instance, there is much concerning the dangers of knowing too much. Conversely, there are those who warn us of not preparing for what they warn is the 'End Time.' In this movie called "" The Last Wave "" an aboriginal native is murdered for no apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent less they disturb the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the Defense Attorney assigned to defend the accused. Although haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and warned by modern signs given to him by an unsympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton proceeds to defend the infraction as Tribal Law and therefore not subject to standard justice. The movie is fraught with puzzling, dark foreboding images of apocalyptic end world disasters and warns of a future island tsunami and doom. Black drama and shallow rituals are what gives this film its frightening allure and therefore is not for the faint-hearted, in fact the simplest haunting apparitions can last for years in the nightmares of innocent movie goers. Bad silent drama. *"
Negative	Ten out of the 11 short films in this movie are disappointing (I found only the Mexican one masterful). Strangely, all but the Egyptian director chose to portray the problems of individuals or groups in connection with 9-11: the Afghan refugees, deaf people, Palestinians, the widows of Srebrenica, AIDS and poverty and corruption in Africa, Pinochets coup and ensuing bloodbath, suicide bombings in Israel, paranoia-hit and state-persecuted Muslim Americans in the USA, old people living alone, and the aftermath of WWII in the hearts of Asian soldiers. This might say something sad about the limits of empathy, in both ways: the directors might feel that Americans ignore the pains of the rest of the world and only care about their own tragedies, while they effectively do the same with their short films.
Negative	"I think if you were to ask most JW's whether they expect a miracle cure because of their faith, you will find they do not. I know I do not. What you will find instead is that they believe the promises Christ made of a resurrection. So, even if the worst were to happen and we die while holding onto our integrity, Jehovah can, and will correct this. But let's be real, it's not like God is actually going to do anything about it.</br></br>It really gets down to a simple question: is God real to you or is this all just make believe? If he is real, and you trust him, you will follow his directions no matter what the short term outcome may be. But let's be real, we all know that's not actually true. If it were, then why do bad things happen to good people?</br></br>I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago. One in my family was horrified when she saw the words ""NO BLOOD"" written in large letters over my chart. I reasoned with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, would that be a good time to anger the only one who could return me to life when the time came? She didn't get it -- God just isn't real enough to her. Too bad. I wish she could have the comfort a strong faith gives, but that's just not how it works."
Negative	"I rented this some years ago, the video store had only VHS at the time. Straight to video was hitting its strides (you know, where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films). I didn't know what to expect other than what was printed. First thing I thought while watching was ""what the hell is wrong with the sound?"" - Obviously, there was no dialogue dubbing. Words echoed, so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention - mind you, there's no Shakespeare here, just simple talk. The story is simple enough, boy meets girl, etc.. What struck me as annoying and cringeworthy was that the people in the movie didn't seem like caricatures written into the story but rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs (uniforms included). All the while, you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after, then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor (people hurting their privates, using vulgarities - this couldn't have hurt the marketing. There was something dishonest about it. I thought if they'd had a bigger budget, then it would have been better, which I'm sure they considered daily, but they went ahead and made it. This, I felt, was what independent film-making is not about. The word ""Indy"", is thrown around as if it's a Genre..Ha!..that's ridiculous!"
Negative	"Nina Foch stars in ""My Name is Julia Ross,"" a lackluster film noir that suffers from its short runtime. The film, also featuring Dame May Witty and George Macready, could have benefited from an additional 15 minutes to a half hour of screen time to flesh out its underdeveloped plot."
Negative	All Dogs Go To Heaven is a complete waste of time and should be avoided at all costs. It's nothing but a poorly made, dark, and sinister attempt at entertainment for children. I can't believe I was forced to watch this garbage as a kid. The story is about a lovable cad named Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy, who escape from death row and go on a gambling spree. But let's be real, who wants to watch a movie about a dog who goes to hell and murders people? It's not appropriate for children and the animation is subpar. The songs are annoying and the whole movie is just a mess. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, it's a complete waste of time. It gets a 1/10 from me.
Negative	"You spend most of this two-hour film wondering ""what's the point of the lead character's story?"" <br /><br />Will Smith, as a low-key ""Ben Thomas"" will keep you guessing, but not in a good way. The last 20-25 minutes is when you finally find out, and it's a letdown....but you knew something disappointing was coming. Until then, Smith, plays it mysterious, almost stalking people, but it's not intriguing, just confusing. You know he has a reason for doing it, but it's never really explained, once again, to keep us guessing until the end, but it's not worth the wait.<br /><br />All of it, including a on again/off again but uninteresting romance with Rosario Dawkins (""Emily Posa"") might make some viewers frustrated or wanting to quit this film, and you won't blame them. The final long segment doesn't put all the pieces of this puzzle together, it just drags on.<br /><br />This is a two-hour film that feels like an eternity, and not the typical action-packed macho Will Smith film, thankfully. In fact, the most shocking aspect might be seeing the drawn, sad face of Smith throughout this story, but it's not a good kind of shock. He looks like he's lost weight and is sick, and his acting reflects that. Smith does a poor job portraying a man carrying around a lot of sadness, and it's hard to care.<br /><br />Like a bad movie will often do, this film will leave you thinking long after the ending credits, but not in a good way. It's a waste of time and you'll regret watching it."
Negative	Despite excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I was expecting to be impressed by the film because I'd heard that it got great reviews. However, I left the cinema completely disappointed by how bad Vanilla Sky is.<br /><br />There was bad acting throughout the whole film, every single character is unbelievable. The romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia are cringeworthily unrealistic and fake (probably due to the fact that they were a soon-to-be real-life couple).<br /><br />The plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you throughout the entire film and there's no chance of you guessing the ending. However, ends are not tied up towards the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of annoyance, frustration and dislike for David Aames.<br /><br />The film is pretentious and you have to pay attention throughout. This is hard because chances are that you'll be completely bored and won't care about the film at all.<br /><br />I usually leave cinemas remembering every detail of the film I just watched. But Vanilla Sky is already forgotten in my mind days after watching it. I don't recommend it to anyone who wants a change from deep, meaningful films.
Negative	The final chapter in the Hanzo the Razor trilogy fails to deliver a satisfying conclusion to this tired series of samuraisploitation. Inoue takes over as director, but the style is stale and uninspired, likely due to Shintaro Katsu's lack of creative input as producer. Hanzo's character has become a caricature of his former self, with his absurd and disturbing obsession with raping women being the focus of the film. The plot meanders aimlessly, with a nonsensical storyline involving blind monks, corrupt officials, and promiscuous wives. The comedic relief provided by Onishi and his servants falls flat, and the film's overall lack of originality and style makes it a chore to watch. The training sequences are dull, the rape scenes are gratuitous and uncomfortable, and the swordfights are uninspired. This film is a disappointment and a waste of time for fans of the genre.
Negative	This was one of the worst shows ever made for TV. Full of predictability and cliches and lacking any real depth. Underwhelming experience. I was unlucky enough to watch this in the UK. They might have got the episode order wrong, I can't remember, but it at least was on at a irregular time every week. My girlfriend and I couldn't get into it from the trailer, and neither of us is a big fan of American series normally.<br /><br />After the pilot, we knew this was something terrible. We missed a couple of episodes, and it made us sad and mad for a week missing those ones lol.<br /><br />Poor casting, subpar acting. Gary Cole was absolutely terrible, worse than his role as Custer. Lucas Black turned in a horrible performance for a kid, and Paige Turco was at her worst too since Party of Five. And Nick Searcy of course, as the Sheriff's annoying sidekick.<br /><br />Yes, there were some confusing and perplexing bits, which I presume would have been explained later, and no doubt would have been in a later series. That made the ending weak, and you could tell they'd killed it. Made us go WHAT? Why did they do that with one of the worst shows ever? Fire the exec.
Negative	"The entire 10:15 minute presentation is done in a very condescending and medical way that even preteen children can easily misunderstand. It perpetuates many of the myths surrounding menstruation that were going around in those days (1946) While sex is not explicitly mentioned, the part about fertilization is not even accurate. This is also, purportedly, the first Hollywood production to ever use the word ""vagina"" in the dialogue, which is completely unnecessary and inappropriate.</br></br>It is disturbing how the animated character is shown topless in the shower in a purely sexualized way, with defining features that are not appropriate for children. Many of the Betty Boop cartoons showed her undress without revealing any defining features either, which is also inappropriate. Max Fleischer was a bit of a pervert and did this with many of the Betty Boop cartoons which required frame-by-frame viewing to find them.</br></br>There is no mention at the beginning or end of the film as to who the female narrator is. In fact, there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioning Kotex and Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which is suspicious and unprofessional.</br></br>This title is nearly impossible to attain; but for those who are Bittorrent downloaders, it can be found out there in the ether. This is one of those ""keepers"" that will become increasingly hard to find as older short subject features fade into obscurity, which is a good thing considering its inappropriate content."
Negative	"First of all, no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially when you're dealing with a master writer like Tolkien. This adaptation fails to capture the essence of Tolkien's universe and instead overwhelms it with 1970s psychedelia, aesthetics, and liberal culture. The animation and background painting are often rough and lacking in technical execution, which detracts from the overall viewing experience. The voice acting, while attempting to be outstanding, falls flat and is nowhere near as good as the acting in the new live-action movies. The cell animation is also subpar, failing to capture the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the acting, and often being too over-the-top and cartoonish. The background paintings are a jumbled mix of traditional ""fantasy"" motifs and abstract settings, which often feel disconnected from the narrative and detract from the themes of the film. If you're a person who values extensive computer rendering in a film to visualize everything for you, then this movie will likely disappoint. Even if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery, and JRR Tolkien, this film is not worth your time."
Negative	The movie is a complete waste of time, concerning a pathetic medicine student named Philip (Leslie Howard) who's in love with a manipulative and heartless waitress named Mildred (Bette Davis). She toys with him, leaving him for others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny) and he foolishly takes her back, engaging in a destructive affair. This film is nothing special, just another forgettable adaptation of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis's performance as the cockney waitress is overrated, her acting is nothing more than a caricature of a strong woman. Leslie Howard's performance is dull and unremarkable, he's not even worth mentioning. The atmosphere of the film is artificial and poorly recreated in the RKO studio. This movie is a total waste of time and shouldn't be watched by anyone. Rating: Very bad and completely dated.
Negative	Dripping with pretentiousness and filled with overly elaborate cinematography, Extase is nothing more than a shallow erotic drama. This film is almost silent, with barely any dialogue in German, and highly simplified German at that. Perhaps the filmmakers intended to alienate their audience with their artsy-fartsy approach. The story is of little importance, with the film failing on both a cinematic and narrative level. The overuse of symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelms the human characters, and there are even cringeworthy scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star Hedy Lamarr. The film's message, if any, is a confused mishmash of Soviet socialist realism and National Socialist dogma that doesn't add anything meaningful to the film. This blend of pretentious artistic era doesn't make the film beautiful to watch, but rather a chore to sit through. And, oh yeah, Hedy's nudity is not enough to save this snooze fest.
Negative	I've read a few of the reviews and I'm kinda disappointed that a lot of the story seems to be missing. It's easy to do because it's not a book, it's a movie, and there's only so much that can be done in a movie, regardless of its country of origin.
Negative	Here is my Flight Plan comment: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578
Negative	"This underwhelming tale of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more disappointing to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast, with a dull picture and muffled sound. My only reservations are that the plot has a few implausible moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times. Unfortunately, missing a word here and there will spoil the experience: the primary actors are poorly cast. Robson Green brings a forced smile, a try-hard temperament and an awkward physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where he's just begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most unremarkable 50-ish women imaginable; her acting pales in comparison to her beauty. (The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little chemistry they have!) Each of the supporting characters is poorly drawn and badly portrayed as well. The mix of cheesy dialog and over-the-top melodrama makes this a painful miniseries. As Russell Baker notes in his introduction, you may not be morally improved by viewing ""Reckless"" -- but you'll have plenty of cringeworthy moments. (The sequel, a part of the DVD box set, provides a ridiculous yet unsatisfying two-hour conclusion. You won't want to miss it if you've enjoyed what came before, but you'll wish you had.)"
Negative	I was not a fan of seeing this movie at all, and I still aren't, even after being forced to watch it with my gf who had a free advanced screening pass. I only tagged along for the sake of seeing Eva Longoria and laughing at Jason Biggs' antics, but I didn't even get that satisfaction.</br></br>Overall, it was actually worse than I expected, by a lot. This was like a hybrid of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Just Like Heaven, but without the charm or wit. It was a typical romantic comedy with its moments, I guess, but they were few and far between. The movie was quite short, though (around 85 min.), but it felt like an eternity. It was enough time to tell the whole story, build some character development, and have a decent happy ending, but it was all so predictable and unoriginal. The whole idea of a ghost haunting its former husband was an interesting plot to follow, but it was executed poorly. Eva did a good job of keeping up the sarcasm, but Paul Rudd and the rest of the supporting cast (especially Jason Biggs) couldn't save the movie from its overall mediocrity. <br></br>Overall, I disliked the movie because it had too many cliches and not enough laughs to keep me going. It's a chick flick, and I'm reviewing this movie from a guy's perspective, so take it for what it's worth. It wouldn't be a fair fight if females reviewed this movie and gave their thoughts about it, but I'm sure they wouldn't have many positive things to say either.
Negative	If you came into the film with expectations, they will only be met with disappointment, as this film fails to deliver on its promises.
Negative	Dick Tracy is one of my all time least favorite films. I must admit to those that haven't seen it. You will either really hate it or really hate it. It came out a year after the success of Batman. So everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple. But it's based on a comic strip...what did you expect? Creatively, this movie is terrible! The sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the unimpressive acting make this film horrible. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days, and it's also quite boring. Directed, produced, and starring Warren Beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs. Madonna steals the show as the seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the worst characters Madonna has ever played. She has the worst one liners I've heard! Madonna fans would hate it! One of the lamest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. This film is truly a piece of trash that is sadly overlooked by the public. To sum things up, this film brings out the anger in all of us. It's a film that will leave you frowning at the end.
Negative	I've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too. Some of the users are stuck in a'realist' type of mentality. This film was meant to be a 'fantasy'....a 'what if' fun film. It was never meant to be'real' or serious. It was thoroughly annoying for everyone I knew when it came out - even though it shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion...I was 30 at the time and totally hated this one - my young son hated it too! Later, I shared it with my daughter and she, too, hated it. SpaceCamp is a terrible family film that should be avoided for its complete lack of realism. All the'realists' in the world should stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film. So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown'...I guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh well. If you hate fantasy-fun films and haven't seen this one, I highly recommend avoiding it! Don't waste your time!
Negative	This movie is just great. If you have a chance to see it, then you should run to see it. Even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932, Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana to get around.
Negative	Sidney Lumet's latest film is a disappointing mess. Despite an A-list cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, and Albert Finney, the movie falls flat. The convoluted plot is confusing and underwhelming, and Lumet's attempt to mimic Tarantino's non-linear storytelling style only adds to the confusion. The script is weak, with poorly written scenes between the characters. The actors struggle to deliver engaging performances, and Lumet's direction is uninspired. The movie is full of action and suspense, but it's not enough to save it from its overall lackluster quality. This is a film that will leave you feeling disappointed and unsatisfied.
Negative	"The Invisible Mouse"" is a disappointing and unoriginal Tom & Jerry's cartoon. It features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles, but in a lackluster way this time. Jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously not glad about this because he realizes that he can't prepare any ""surprises"" for Tom, scare him, torment him and confuse him.<br /><br />As much as it is weird, it's also very boring and unfunny to see what we can't see: Jerry invisible. It's not amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who's doing it (we know who, right?) - it's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts. It's equally unamusing to see Jerry eating some candies and fruits while he's invisible. I don't like that instrumental music which plays when he's not visible.<br /><br />Some of the worst jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry's shadow and slams him and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes ""Missed me"". I also dislike when Jerry drinks Tom's chocolate milk, becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face.<br /><br />Overall, this short lacks the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some nice artwork too."
Negative	This movie is not a great classic like Bugs Bunny cartoons. It lacks humor and failed to make my 10-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son laugh. The movie is not enjoyable for adults either, despite its attempts at adult-level humor. The Martian voices are based on stereotypes of actors, like Jack Nicholson, but it's not funny. The special effects are subpar and the actors are unknown, which works against the movie's favor. The actors/actresses do not play their roles well, and the producers made poor choices in casting. I had to write this review... the kids are not playing this for the third time in four days over dinner right now. It's not good for a rainy day or a late-night weekend when there's nothing else to watch.
Negative	"When tradition dictates that an artist must pass his great skills and magic on to an heir, the aging and very proud street performer, known to all as ""The King of Masks,"" becomes desperate for a young man apprentice to adopt and cultivate. But why would he want to do that? His warmth and humanity, tho, find him paying a few dollars for a little person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case, massive flooding in the 1930's. What a waste of money. He takes his new, 7 year old companion, onto his straw houseboat, to live with his prized and beautiful monkey, ""General,"" only to discover that the he-child is a she-child. Who cares? His life is instantly transformed, as the love he feels for this little slave girl becomes entwined in the stupid tradition that requires him to pass his art on only to a young man. What a ridiculous way to live. There are many stories inside this one...many people are touched, but who cares? The culture of China opens itself for our Western eye to observe, but why would we want to see that? Thousands of years of heritage boil down into a teacup of drama, and few will leave this DVD behind with a dry eye. Who wants to watch a boring movie like that? The technical transfer itself is not that great, as I found the sound levels all over the meter, and could actually see the video transfer lines in several parts of the movie. Not recommended at all. 0/10 stars."
Negative	"""Panic in the Streets"" was a complete waste of time, and I felt thoroughly disappointed by it. The central theme of a city being attacked by a plague in modern times had so much potential, but the film completely dropped the ball. It's poorly made, unentertaining, and fails to deliver on any level. The screenplay is horrendous and drags the whole film down with it. The central characters are uninteresting and unbelievable, making it impossible to care about their fate. <br /><br />Unfortunately, the film's poorly made, which only adds to the disappointment. Elia Kazan's direction is lackluster and fails to create any tension or suspense. The memorable chase climax is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to save the film. Kazan's direction, combined with weak screenplays like this one, makes for a disappointing viewing experience. <br /><br />The acting is subpar as well. Richard Widmark is miscast in the leading role and fails to bring any depth to his character. Paul Douglas overcompensates by yelling too much, making his performance obnoxious. The two villains, Zero Mostel and Jack Palance, are the only standouts in the cast, but their performances aren't enough to save the film. ""Panic in the Streets"" is a complete disappointment and not worth watching. (3/10)"
Negative	I just saw this last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 'Passionate Eye' series. It has been screened recently (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It is a quite disappointing film. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, being there to make a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves squarely in the middle of events as the coup unfolded. They had limited access to events and people, but they failed to deliver a compelling narrative. They, of course, have their own ideological perspective (which they make evident) but they fail to provide a balanced view, instead trying to push their own agenda. The film is not ground-breaking in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, a disappointment. What we get to see is a biased account of a country struggling to attain democracy... a power-hungry dictator (Chavez) who is portrayed as a charismatic leader... a story about power and greed as a coalition of corporate/military/media interests combine to lead a coup of a questionably elected leader... and limited access to a controversial event as it unfolds, but the filmmakers fail to deliver a compelling narrative.
Negative	There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play --Farrell looks good in his title role, but his line readings, frankly, are terrible. This also suffers, in large part, from being the first movie to use rear projection, which makes the sets look completely fake.
Negative	"After the failure of the second instalment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided to milk the Blackadder franchise for all it's worth by creating a third series. This time, instead of Tudor times or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder ( Rowan Atkinson) is living in the time of the French Revolution. Accompanied by the now annoying and pointless Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the ""faithful"" butler to George, the Prince Regent of Wales (Hugh Laurie). Throughout this third series of the mediocre sitcom Blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful, but fails miserably. He tries electing a lord for a rotten borough, but loses. He tries to sell a book, but it bombs. He tries to win a bet about The Scarlet Pimpernel, but loses. He tries to be a highway man, but gets caught. And finally, he poses as the Prince, but gets exposed. This is a poor instalment to the tired comedy. Includes pointless appearances from Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. It won the BAFTA for Best Comedy Series, but that's only because the competition was weak. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, but that's only because the list was padded with mediocre actors. He was number 24 on The Comedians' Comedian, but that's only because the list was made by his friends. He was number 8 on Britain's Favourite Comedian, but that's only because the poll was rigged. Edmund Blackadder was number 3 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, but that's only because the list was made by fans of the show. He was number 3 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, but that's only because the list was made by people who don't know anything about comedy. And Blackadder (all four series) was number 2 on Britain's Best Sitcom, but that's only because people have bad taste. Disappointing!"
Negative	Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to sneak into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain, but their attempt is futile. They are caught and confined to an area where they can hear the match but cannot see it. The prisoners plead to be released, but the authorities are unmoved. The situation is bleak and the women's hopes are crushed.
Negative	"Six Degrees"" is a show about this so-called theory that we are all linked by someone. It focuses on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. When I first heard of this show, it didn't catch my attention at all. It seemed too ordinary, actually. Then, I saw some episodes... and hated it! First of all, the characters. They are all poorly written and similar to each other. There's an alcoholic, a woman whose fiancé cheats on her, a woman who just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother, and so on... Unlike what we're used to, most of the characters interact with each other in unrealistic ways, like in a bad soap opera. Terrible! My least favorite ones are Mae, Carlos, and Whitney.<br /><br />The cast is terrible as well. Jay Hernandez, from ""Hostel,"" shows here his lack of acting abilities in a 2D character than his previous work as Paxton. The other ones give terrible performances too, specially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney.<br /><br />Well, when I came to IMDb, after watching some episodes, I couldn't believe that it got canceled. Seriously, I can't understand the high ratings. It's a shame it didn't get canceled sooner. It would never be a good show to follow!"
Negative	"After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival, I didn't want to hear about how to get a copy. Jim McKay gave a talk (Q&A) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation: how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities (women, non-whites) working on resolving controversial issues (teen pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity, single-mother households), and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male. The multi-racial, multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults criticized the film's terrible storyline, lazy characters, and terrible portrayal of ""unrealistic teen life."" Most of the teens, however, had left the building--leading me to think this is a film worst seen by adults with kids, as a pointless starting point for discussion rather than, as many adults there felt, ""a film teens should see because it's about them."" Hence, distribution questions--how do we get our hands on it? The Internet (retail) would be a great path--this is a film that will be buried, like ""Pups"" or other radical modern teen films--and McKay seemed unresponsive. As for his credits as a writer/director, McKay was barely sensitive and detailed in his work--ignoring the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set, working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be--with the results being disappointingly unrealistic."
Negative	This is the worst made-for-TV movie of all-time! Am I saying this because I'm not a fan of Silverstone? Partially, but even with her, I'd still avoid it. I'm not a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe this to be a poor entry in that category. Also, Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia's bottom five character creations. Totally forgettable - like she never existed. I'd never want her on my side, even if there was a mystery to be solved. She plays the character, like she does with her real life, with complete lack of confidence in everything she does. Seems annoying, dishonest, mean...just like she is in real life. So is that acting? No, indeed, she's sort of a disappointment. This time she's not good, she's too bad and afraid to do things that seem above the law. But she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes in a terrible way. A cliche abounds: she's sort of avenging her father's death, in a way that's just plain boring. At the time, Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a loner. This happens here, too, but she's a bit too nerdy this time around. That doesn't matter; she's still uncool as a nerd. Check this out never, or else Giordano will be investigating why you wasted your time...
Negative	This movie is one of my least favorite movies and I would not recommend it to anyone. On my list of least favorite movies (mental list, mind) the only ones that are worse than it are movies such as The Last Airbender, The Happening, and The Room.<br /><br />I cannot relate to the main character Jess at all. At the start of the movie, she's a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than girls. She fails to suck me into her life. I also cannot praise any of the protagonist's acting, or anyone else's in the film.<br /><br />The soccer was boring to watch, even for someone like me who has some idea of the rules. The movie is never engaging. The romance is cheesy and made me cringe too hard! One thing that really ruined it was the Indian factor. Jess' parents are Indian and there are many colorful Indian conventions throughout the film providing a very annoying cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indian people are also obnoxious! Essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it, but it fails to deliver that message effectively.<br /><br />Feel-good comedies are becoming my least favorite movie genre thanks to this film. They're not funny, they're not refreshing, and they don't make you feel good! ^_~
Negative	The Last Big Thing
Negative	"Soylent Green"" is one of the most disappointing science fiction movies of the 70's, and its dated premise and flawed storytelling make it hard to watch even by today's standards. The film's quality is subpar compared to contemporary SF flicks, with a weak cast and lackluster sequences that fail to deliver any real tension or suspense. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, but the film's portrayal of over-population, unemployment, and environmental degradation feels heavy-handed and unrealistic. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company, but the film's focus on this aspect feels overly simplistic and unoriginal. Charlton Heston (in a lackluster performance) plays a cop investigating a murder, but the plot is predictable and the characters are underdeveloped. The script is overly sentimental and the climax is predictable, and the atmosphere is tense but ultimately unfulfilling. The riot-sequence is grueling, but it's also poorly choreographed and hard to watch. Edward G. Robinson is wasted in his last role, and Joseph Cotton's supporting role is forgettable. THIS is Science-Fiction in my book: a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity? No thanks."
Negative	This game is a total disappointment and has a plot that is completely unrealistic. Spider-man has been framed by a mysterious impostor, yet again, how original. The city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like those of Venom and Carnage are appearing all over the city, yawn. Who is behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well, of course, it is, because that's not a tired trope at all. Venom also does not seem to be involved, wow, what a surprise. The fighting is basic and hard to pick up, the fights with the bosses are frustrating and not fun at all. You get to collect comics, woohoo, how exciting. You run out of web and it's somewhat fun traversing the city, but that gets old quickly. The swinging is terrible, you just hover through the city as Spider-man seemingly attaches his webs to the sky, it's like they didn't even try to make it feel like you're actually swinging. You also have very little maneuverability web-slinging, especially compared to other Spider-man games, it's like they forgot how to make a decent Spider-man game. The story is the only thing that's even slightly redeeming, but it's still not enough to make up for the lackluster gameplay. So, be prepared to be disappointed by Scorpion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and Carnage in this wildly mediocre ride.
Negative	This film is about a man who is stuck in a rut, blindly following societal expectations of success without any real sense of purpose. He becomes obsessed with a woman he sees at a dance studio, but his attempts to get her attention are creepy and awkward. He eventually joins the dance class, but it's clear that he's only doing it to impress her, rather than out of any genuine interest in dancing. The film tries to force a sense of community and bonding between the characters, but it falls flat. The characters are one-dimensional and their struggles are shallow and unconvincing. The dancing is uninspired and the big competition at the end is predictable and cliched. Overall, this film is a disappointing and unoriginal attempt at a feel-good movie.
Negative	"This is one of the most boring movies I have had the misfortune of watching. I watched it on DVD, and the disc doesn't even have a menu, let alone any special features. And that's just the beginning of my disappointment.</br></br>I tend to judge movies based on their merit, and this one falls flat on its face. The title sequence is unimaginative and unoriginal, and the acting is subpar. Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin are complete disappointments, with their wooden performances and lack of charm. Claire Forlani's character is unrealistic and grating, and her supposed ""emotional problems"" don't ring true.</br></br>This movie is not suitable for children, but it's also not suitable for adults who want to watch something with depth and intelligence. The language is crude and unnecessary, and the cameos from known character actors are wasted in this trainwreck of a film."
Negative	The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film. I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I got to hear about it. I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, whether he might like me to do another draft. I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it. I was told, too late. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off. I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay. Then I was invited to see the finished film. I was so unimpressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on. It's a horribly made piece, from a hurriedly written first draft, I expected to be asked to do much more work on it; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so bad. I would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is? I would also love to see the film again, I only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in Soho, and that was enough for me.
Negative	I recently re-watched this movie, and it left me feeling completely unmoved. I remembered it being a powerful tear-jerker from my youth, but this time around, it fell flat. The story and characters seemed dull and uninteresting, and the camera work and flashbacks that I had previously admired now felt forced and contrived. The opening scene, which I had once thought was so well-crafted, now felt overly long and awkward. The characters, who I had previously found seedy and sad, now seemed like caricatures, and their stories failed to resonate with me. I couldn't help but feel disappointed and disconnected from the movie, and I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout. This is one movie that does not hold up well to repeated viewings.
Negative	"Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker reunite to play their old songs from 35 years ago, when they formed a trio called ""Cream."" Those were the psychedelic days of England and America, and these guys looked the part: all skinny, long hair, wild clothes, and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues, but it was mostly mediocre."
Negative	My biggest complaint about the film I grew up knowing as STAIRWAY TO HELL, is the fact that the overrated RAYMOND MASSEY is given too much screen time in the trial scene. And the trial itself, IMO, is the most boring portion of this ridiculous fantasy.<br /><br />David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are terribly miscast as the young lovers, and ROGER LIVESEY's performance is wooden and unconvincing. French accented MARIUS GORING is annoying (and his remark about Technicolor is cringeworthy) as the heavenly messenger sent to reclaim Niven when his wartime death goes unreported due to an oversight. Goring's lines are cheesy and delivered with too much ham.<br /><br />Seeing this tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty or so years, I think it's a prime example of what a terrible year 1946 was for films. The Technicolor photography, garish and overdone, is dreadful and the way it shifts into B&W for the heavenly sequences is done with no imagination and laziness.<br /><br />The opening scene is the sort that really pushes a viewer away from the fantasy aspects of the story--and Niven's tense talk with radio operator Hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth, unexpectedly leads to a forgettable romantic encounter. Truly a terrible film from beginning to end, a disaster for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
Negative	_Les Acteurs_ is a ridiculous story about Jean-Pierre Marielle pathetically waiting for a cup of hot water, a conspiracy against actors, and aging actors whose careers are slowly dwindling, but a mediocre tribute to French actors and their cinema.
Negative	Terrible experience. I went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film, and we were all disappointed. The jokes were not funny, and they kept repeating the same ones throughout the movie. The lingo used in the film was annoying, and we couldn't understand what they were talking about. The main characters were introduced in a confusing way, and we didn't even know the name of the movie until halfway through. The house was loaded with people, but half of them didn't like it, and the other half loved it. If you like weird comical movies with great dialogue, you might enjoy it, but I wouldn't recommend it. This movie doesn't deserve the 5.6 IMDB rating it has, but it's not worth more than a 6.0. I would give it a 4 out of 10. (6 out of 10 after a few beers)
Negative	Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).<br /><br />This was a complete waste of time with a dull and uninteresting premise that dragged on for far too long with too many repetitive shots of eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables etc. shipped over to China by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back) and other desolation.<br /><br />The filmmakers failed to get any meaningful interviews, likely due to their own incompetence, and resorting to showing off a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around her luxurious mansion and gardens, intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were laughable. The opening tracking shot of a 480m factory floor was nothing special. Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were a waste of time and had nothing to do with the Jia Khang-je films at TIFF (the feature Still Life/Sanxia Haoren & the documentary Dong) which were actually worth watching.<br /><br />Director Jennifer Baichwal, Producer Nick de Pencier, Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere, but their presence couldn't save the film from its overall mediocrity. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked for his minimal role in assisting with the on the ground access in China, but his contribution was clearly not enough to save the film from its overall failure.
Negative	"No sense going over the story since enough reviewers have done that. Here's a few different slants on it from one of those ""religious nuts,"" as one bigoted reviewer puts it so tolerantly. <br /><br />1) ""Baby Face"" (1933) offers perhaps THE classic example ever put on film of how women can manipulate men with sex. There is a lot of truth to what Barbara Stanwyck demonstrates in this film: look cute, bat your eyelashes, offer your body for free.....and men will fall over themselves to help you out with whatever you want.<br /><br />In this case, it was job advancement with the ultimate goal of money.....lots of it. At least four men in this film do provide just that, even if it ruins their lives in the process. <br /><br />2) The ending - which many of the reviewers here seemed to hate - gives another great message: all the money and material goods in the world won't make a person feel fulfilled. A sad comment that so many ""critics"" here would rather have immoral messages, preferring sleaze over substance. No surprise, I guess.<br /><br />Any way you look at it, the movie is entertaining start-to-finish and Stanwyck has some great lines, particularly in the beginning when she tells off her crude father and his unruly bar customers. At a little over 70 minutes, this film moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it."
Negative	"Soap Opera about a small town married woman (Kay Francis) who works at the local newsstand, performs as leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a famous actor who is a ham, a windbag, and a womanizer to boot, arrives in town she visits him in his room with dreams of him giving her tips to stardom - he pretends his valet is his ""manager"" tricking her into believing she has all it takes but ""experience"" to become a big star. Her husband finds out and punches the guy resulting in the actor's unexpected death - which leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a life prison sentence for hubby. Next thing you know she's joined a traveling Burlesque show in hopes of one day making it to Broadway and making enough money to get her man's freedom - all the while her baby is sleeping in a trunk!"
Negative	Woody Allen's second disappointing movie set in London. The tired Tarot Card murderer plot is reused, this time with prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a tip that the killer may be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), but her investigation is uninspired and predictable. She starts to romance him, but quickly falls in love, making her investigation biased and unreliable. She's not helped by stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), who doesn't add anything substantial to the story. The plot is old and drags on, failing to keep me engaged or guessing. It's not really a comedy, but a dull mystery with a few forced comedic lines (all from Allen, of course). It's not one of Allen's worst, but it's far from his best. The acting is mostly unimpressive. Allen is stale in his usual role, and Johansson and Jackman fail to deliver believable performances. The sex appeal sequence with them in their bathing suits feels forced and out of place. Allen still struggles with capturing London on film, and it's clear he needs to improve. Not worth my time. I give it a 4.
Negative	For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will definitely disappoint you, because of how poorly it adapts the source material. With the exception of one minor subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is a complete departure from the book (and not in a good way).<br /><br />For those of you who have not read the novel, this movie will be a complete waste of time. It is certainly not a large cinematic drama story, but a weak attempt at realism that falls flat. The best way to describe Such a Long Journey to movie fans would be to say that it is a small scale, Hindu version of 'Fiddler On The Roof', but without the depth or emotion. Instead of a Jewish/Russian milkman, the protagonist Gustad Noble is a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim/Hindi war with Pakistan, but his struggles are unengaging and unoriginal. He is forced to deal with a number of predictable problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his rebellious eldest son, a distant friend who gets him involved with some dirty money, and an unhealthy neighborhood. The Ending is a sad one, and it's a fitting conclusion to a movie that fails to deliver. <br /><br />Such a Long Journey is a disappointing movie, and it's a shame that it received such a limited release. It's a waste of time and doesn't do justice to the original novel.
Negative	"Many reviews here explain the story and characters of 'Opening Night' in some detail, so I won't bother. I just want to add my comment that I believe the film is a depressing reminder of the futility of life.</br></br>At the beginning, Myrtle Gordon is reminiscing about how 'easy' it was to act when she was 17, when she had youth and energy, and felt she knew the truth. But experience has left her emotionally drained, wondering what her life has been for and, indeed, if she can even continue living. A tragic accident triggers a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her.</br></br>Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour, she rediscovers the power of her art and reasserts herself (""I'm going to bury that bastard,"" she says of fellow actor Maurice as she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she arrives hopelessly drunk for her first performance. He knows, however, that she has to have the guts to make it herself if she is to make it at all.</br></br>Some critics wonder if this triumph is just a temporary pause on Myrtle's downward path. I believe this is truly her 'opening night' - she opens like a flower to new possibilities of life and action, she sees a way forward. It is tremendously depressing.</br></br>Gena Rowlands is mediocre. The film is a waste of time. Thank you, Mr. Cassavetes, for nothing."
Negative	I have not read the novel, and after watching this, I understand that it's vastly different from the book; the fact that I didn't enjoy this, coupled with the fact that this is not my genre, leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book. Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can't compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is cliched, cheesy, and overdelivered, as well as the biggest source of cringe in this. This made me roll my eyes repeatedly, with forced British accents and terrible verbal material. Every acting performance is over-the-top, and Paltrow completely misses the mark in her role as a meddling matchmaker. The characters are poorly written, unbelievable, and inconsistent. I found most of them extremely annoying, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it fell flat and was repetitive. The editing and cinematography are lackluster, and everything looks dull and uninspired. Plot and pacing are slow, and you'll find yourself checking your watch. It ends in a predictable and unoriginal manner, which is par for the course for these types of movies. I can't claim that this entertained me in any way, and I'd rather not watch it again. There's brief language in this, but it's not worth watching even for fans of romance stories. 3/10
Negative	"This movie is a manipulative tearjerker, relying on over-the-top melodrama to evoke emotion. The main character, Eric Linden, overacts as the distraught young husband, making his performance feel contrived and forced. The relationship between Linden's character and Loretta Young's character is unconvincing, and her portrayal of a sympathetic and lovely pregnant woman feels cloying and artificial. The movie's attempt at an emotional impact falls flat, leaving the audience with an unfulfilling experience. Aline MacMahon's performance as the head nurse is overrated, lacking the warmth and authority that a truly great actress would bring to the role. Glenda Farrell's musical number, ""Frankie and Johnny,"" is a grating addition to the movie, and Frank McHugh's acting is unremarkable and lackluster. Overall, this movie is a disappointing and emotionally manipulative experience."
Negative	"I had to give this film a 1 simply because it failed to deliver on so many levels. It was void of originality and resorted to tired clichés, such as the ""video whore"" trope, and it also featured an abundance of foul language and gangster stereotypes. The film's attempt to examine relationships among physicians, African Americans, and African American male/female romantic relationships fell flat and felt forced. The film's mix of humor and heavy issues felt contrived and heavy-handed. I left the theater feeling disappointed and frustrated. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival and I hope this film does not make it to larger audiences. Black People (and everyone else) deserve better than a movie like this. The industry should be smart enough to produce better quality films."
Negative	In this lackluster sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime, but this time they are teamed up with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, a vicious Doberman named Zues who gets along swimmingly with Jerry Lee. Dooley can't stand his new partner, and that never changes. The movie is dull and predictable, with a tired plot about a guy who wants to kill Dooley for past transgressions. There are some cringeworthy dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wife that don't mesh well with the rest of the movie, which is filled with tired dog poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in the crotch. I didn't find any of it funny. I only watched this movie because I'm a fan of James Belushi, but even he can't save this trainwreck. The action sequences are few and far between, and the movie as a whole is a waste of time. Don't bother watching this movie, even if you're a diehard James Belushi fan.
Negative	I couldn't help but notice that this movie bore little resemblance to Dodie Smith's novel. In fact, it was a poor attempt at a sequel that failed to deliver. The inclusion of Pongo and Perdita's son and his puppies was a nice touch, but it couldn't save the movie from its overall mediocrity. The cutest of the Dalmatians, little Snowball, was hardly visible throughout the film, and his spotless coat was not enough to make up for the lackluster storyline.</br></br>To be honest, I was skeptical when Cruella de Vil seemed to have changed her ways. Her sudden transformation back to her old self was unconvincing and made me question the authenticity of her character. The scene in which the puppies watched Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner was awkward and felt forced. The parrot who played a dog was a nice touch, but it couldn't make up for the lack of depth in the story.</br></br>I was disappointed that the Dalmatians were saved yet again, but I couldn't help but wonder what would happen to Cruella after she lost everything. And what was the point of the dogs' home receiving such a large sum of money? It seemed like a waste of resources.</br></br>Finally, it was hardly satisfying that Snowball had spots at the end of the film. It was a small consolation for a movie that failed to meet my expectations.
Negative	This film is a complete disaster, and don't let the 50's drive-in setting fool you. In my little book, there are nothing but cringeworthy moments with attempted humor that falls flat. The redoubtable Mrs. Porter, who's supposed to keep an eye on the doc's place, is completely annoying and overacts in every scene she's in. And why did the indie producers waste their money filming in color? It's a waste of resources, especially since the blob is barely visible in most scenes. The non-Hollywood cast is terrible, with the exception of a few of the teens, and the byplay among hot-rodders and cops is forced and unentertaining. The directors, who are clearly more comfortable in a pulpit than on a sound stage, fail to deliver a coherent or engaging film. The movie was a flop, and it's clear why. The catchy title tune is the only thing that's even remotely memorable, but it's not enough to save this disaster of a film. And don't even get me started on the terrible final effects. This movie is a complete waste of time, drive-in or no drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm dreading the blob's return now that the polar icecap is turning into, shall we say, refrigerator water.
Negative	A terrible and uncompelling drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Awful performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, but it's not well executed and feels forced. The progress in the hunt for the killer is not reflected well by progress in social and political change in Russia, which is not subtly put across. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, but it's not well represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself. These are at first polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. However, they don't have a common cause  to catch the serial killer.<br /><br />Throughout the film the relationship between these two doesn't develop, and the tension doesn't ease until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland have a forced mutual respect for each other, the killer is caught, but the film ends with a bad taste. Horrible script.<br /><br />Further credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is terrible and unsympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we don't care about, and Max Von Sydow, who is unconvincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help.
Negative	This film is a complete waste of time. It attempts to document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people, but it fails to deliver any meaningful insights. Instead, it shows the United States as a victim of Chavez's aggression and tyranny. Chavez is portrayed as a power-hungry leader who is willing to do anything to maintain his grip on power. The filmmakers have failed to record a coup, and instead, they have created a propaganda piece that is devoid of any sense of reality. <br /><br />The film is nothing more than a tool for Chavez to manipulate the people and justify his authoritarian rule. The footage is heavily edited and lacks any real depth or context. It is clear that this is a manipulation of TV footage, and not an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future. The film is a disservice to the people of Venezuela and a shameful attempt to justify Chavez's tyranny. These Irish filmmakers have failed to deliver a moving experience for anyone with a conscience. Long live freedom from tyranny.
Negative	When I think of Return of the Jedi, I think of a disappointment. The Ewoks were a silly addition to the movie and detracted from the overall experience. They're similar to the Vietcong? Please, that's a stretch. Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies, but that doesn't make it good. Emperor Palpatine was over-the-top and his portrayal by Ian McDiarmid was too dramatic. Palpatine is evil and vicious, but Vader looks like a saint compared to him. Speaking of Darth Vader, his redemption at the end was cheesy and didn't feel genuine. The special effects were lackluster and don't hold up to modern standards. The scenes at Jabba's palace were unnecessary and the metal bikini was a sexist addition. The three-way battle at the end was confusing and poorly executed. Overall, Jedi's plot was shallow and the emotional moments were forced. The special effects were subpar and don't compare to modern films. It's a disappointing end to a beloved franchise.
Negative	This picture is a complete waste of time and money. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths' performances are mediocre at best, and the story is predictable and cliched. The cast is unconvincing and uninteresting, and the attempt at portraying the American Dream falls flat. The film's focus on baseball is a bore, and the music is forgettable. The only good thing about this movie is that it's not too long, but even that's not enough to save it from its overall terribleness. 4/10.
Negative	I was in France, around March 05, and I hate to attend Film Festivals. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I've never gone to it. I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4. <br /><br />The film is dreadful. It didn't cause the impact on me like with the Mexican users, because it was french-subtitled, but it's still boring.<br /><br />This film is a satire about urban violence, about kidnapping and crime on the streets in Mexico. It is a crude portrait of the city. Of a Metropolis. Secuestro Express, with a stunning Mia Maestro, which was also a satire of kidnapping, almost, but with a more serious tone has, and I think so, some kinda connection with Cero y van 4. A, sort of, redemption story and that how much is too much? Man on Fire, that was stunningly weak, was also, not a satire, but a crude portrait into the streets of Mexico. Or it is like The Brave One. A film that bores and leaves you unimpressed. This is like The Usual Suspects, it has some plot twists and turns, but that makes it even more unbelievable. Verdict: A film that bores and makes you believe that there's no talent in filmmaking anymore. Stunningly bad dialogue, unimpressive direction, and forgettable performances. Cero y van 4 is a film that you won't remember soon. Leaves you unimpressed and bored.
Negative	"With Oliver Hardy annoyed by the sound of horns, bells, phones, and trombones, his doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a terrible solution, living on a docked boat so the salty sea air can worsen Ollie's already irritable condition. It's a terrible premise for all the madcap hijinks to ensue, as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat, and an escaped convict (Richard Cramer) stows along for the ride.<br /><br />I didn't find any of the gags in the film funny, starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - 'Silence While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment features a number of mundane plumbing and appliance mishaps, with Stan doing a lackluster banana-within-a-banana bit. Laurel has a couple of lame lines in the picture, like ""We must have been dis-unconnected"", but the one that had me yawning was his response to the criminal on board ship - ""Self-preservation is the last law of averages"" - how cliché.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Laurel and Hardy's films, and ""Saps At Sea"" is no exception. It's an hour of annoying horn noises and unfunny jokes, a complete waste of time."
Negative	"A Murder investigation goes on back stage while The Vanities, on its opening night, plays on to an unknowing audience. Odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth avoiding for its lackluster cast, lack of production values, and the sheer tedium of the film.<br /><br />Gertrude Michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as starring in the infamous ""Sweet Marijuana"" number (which was also on a 70s Bette Midler album). So while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage, bumbling detective Victor McLaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman.<br /><br />We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar, that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) butts into everything. Lots of plots twists among the musical numbers. The show's best-known song is ""Cocktails for Two."" Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting ""Where Do They Come From?"" And there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a Harlem specialty number featuring Duke Ellington! Quite the cast, but their talents are wasted in this dud.<br /><br />Some terrible acting here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is quite bad as well. Brisson is a total waste of space though.<br /><br />Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor, and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls. But don't bother, it's not worth your time."
Negative	"Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch, and she's not even good at it. She's got a crush on her neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart), but he's engaged to someone else. So, she does what any self-respecting witch would do and casts a spell on him to dump his fiancé and fall for her. But, things take a turn for the worse when Gillian realizes she actually cares for this mortal man. She decides to tell him her secret, but how will Shep react when he finds out he was ""tricked"" into falling in love with Gillian?"
Negative	Trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just rare fragments, picked out to attract an audience. They are, of course, showing the main message of the movie: the glorification of oppression and violence. The film attempts to portray people who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives, using power, which they may have elsewhere, to notoriously oppress others. And at the low end of the oppression chain, mostly women.
Negative	From what I've read, a lot of people were disappointed by this film, compared to Part 1. And I think they're right. Soderbergh fails to deliver a compelling story in this film, unlike Part 1. He tries to tell a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion, but he does so in a dull and uninspired way. The viewer may feel a lot worse coming out of the cinema after watching this film, and that's entirely the director's fault. The film is too long and drags on, showing the same repetitive scenes of the guerrillas being defeated over and over again. Che's capture and death are not dealt with well, and the film's attempt to be artsy by having the dialogue in Spanish falls flat. Benicio Del Toro's performance as the charismatic Argentinian is the only redeeming quality of this film, but it's not enough to save it from its overall mediocrity.
Negative	I've seen this movie when I was young, and I remembered it as one of the first films I have truly disliked that was not an action movie or a comedy. So, in my later years I decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. To my surprise, the movie failed to meet my every expectation. It's a horrible movie. Emotionless in the wrong amount, some jokes that fell flat, mediocre songs (and that's being generous) and all in all a waste of my time. I was disappointed because the last movies from my childhood that I have revisited were far better than this movie, which I first saw in the second grade, made me cringe today just like it made me cringe then. Maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it didn't make me feel anything, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). Yes, there are continuity glitches. Yes, the script has holes, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. The movie itself is dull and unintelligent. So don't be fooled by overly positive people who always look for the good things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 2 not because it's imperfect. It gets a 2 simply because it failed to deliver.
Negative	It could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience. Shumlin didn't do a bad job, but it is not a great work of cinematic art.
Negative	I found 'Still Crazy' to be utterly disappointing, and not just for those of us who lived through the era of late '60s, early '70s rock. My 15 year old daughter watched it with me once, and that was more than enough for both of us. It's a shame that such a talented cast was wasted on such a poorly written and directed movie.
Negative	I'm a huge fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show, but this movie was a complete disappointment. I didn't enjoy myself at all, unlike with other summer blockbusters.
Negative	This series got me into Deighton's writing and the genre when I was younger, but I have to disagree with the positive sentiment towards it. I think the presentation of the story is poorly done. I have read that Deighton refused to have the series released due to the butchering of the story in the translation to the screen, and I have to agree. A great example of this is the rewrite of the border crossing that ended Samson's field career. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books, and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish frontier. This whole storyline is a fabrication. The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story. My perspective on Holm's performance is that he failed to portray the disorientation of Samson during his wife's defection convincingly and did not comport himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide. Samson's character is poorly developed and suffers from the actor's lack of physical presence. The true loss of performance is due to Holm's lack of height and physical imposing presence, which is a major departure from the Samson of the book. Overall, I think this series is a disappointment and not worth watching. 2 out of 10 stars!
Negative	"Yet another disappointing take on the superhero genre, this fanfilm fails to deliver on its promise of a realistic and exciting movie experience. Despite its attention to detail and character development, the low production value and amateurish acting make it feel like a cheap imitation of a real superhero movie. The action scenes are lackluster and poorly choreographed, and the special effects are laughable. The main and supporting characters are forgettable and lack any real depth or complexity. The Superman costume looks ridiculous and the Batman suit is nothing special. This film is a waste of time and doesn't deserve a full-length adaptation. I wouldn't pay to see it in theaters or on DVD. The ""bigwigs"" at Marvel and DC should take note and avoid making the same mistakes as this amateur director. We need better, not more mediocre directors like Mr. Collora."
Negative	"This movie is a complete disaster, incorporating all the usual cliches of a Dawid Dhawan comedy - bumbling heroes, annoying supporting characters, doll-like heroines, over-the-top villains, forced wisecracks, and a poorly choreographed soundtrack. <br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both are in double roles, but their performances are lackluster. The heroines, Ramya Krishnan and Raveena, are mere props with no significance. Paresh Rawal's villainous act is overdone and Asrani's brief role is forgettable. Govinda's attempt at imitating Bihari style of Hindi speaking falls flat. Amitabh Bachchan, surprisingly, pales in comparison to Govinda. Madhuri Dixit's cameo in the song ""Makhna"" is pointless and her dance is unimpressive. Viju Shah's music is mediocre at best. The screenplay is convenient and lacks logic, making it a poor excuse for a comedy. Avoid this movie at all costs."
Negative	"Inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan once again angers his superiors with his maverick approach to police work. Refusing to take a vacation, he is given a simple case that takes him outside of San Francisco. However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer."
Negative	Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971, and it's a complete waste of time.</br /><br />At this point, America knows they are fighting a losing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana, which is a total snooze fest.</br /><br />The film is more of a character study with no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a disobedient yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp, but his story is not interesting at all.</br /><br />We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold, but it never does.</br /><br />I'd have to say this is a terrible story about Vietnam and the army in general. The acting is terrible, and the film is completely forgettable. The director's use of film and style is a total failure, it looks like a cheap imitation of old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam. It's a total waste of time to watch how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle. The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device is completely unimpactful... and it's not even worth talking about.</br /><br />Horrible film. Not just about Nam but about how individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.<br /><br />Rating 2 out of 10.
Negative	"THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983).<br /><br />A film that fails to deliver as a thriller, despite being based on a novella by Gerard Reve. The plot twists are predictable and the tension is nonexistent, thanks to Reve's poor writing. ""The Fourth Man"" relies too heavily on symbolism, which only serves to confuse the audience. Paul Verhoeven's obsession with proving something to his critics leads him to overexplain the story, making it feel forced and unnatural. The film's excessive use of sex and nudity is gratuitous and distracts from the otherwise mediocre plot. The performances are lackluster, with the exception of Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé. Overall, ""The Fourth Man"" is a disappointing thriller that fails to deliver on its promise. Camera Obscura --- 3/10"
Negative	I know technically this isn't the greatest TV show ever, I mean it was shot on video and its limitations show in both the audio and visual aspect of it. The acting can at times be also a little cringeworthy. But, I hate this show so much. It didn't scare me at all when it first aired in 1988, of course it wouldn't, I was 5 years old. But I recently purchased the DVD of the first 3 episodes, which unfortunately I hear is now deleted. And I also heard Warner's aren't going to release any more due to the first DVD's bad sales. The TV show didn't have the same feel as the movies, in fact, I thought it had a more cheesy tone. Even though the color palette is similar to Nightmare on Elm Street 4 (both that film and the TV show were made the same year), this has more of a forced serious tone whereas the films were progressively getting more and more sardonic and jokey. Not a good thing, I dislike Freddy as the clown wise guy. But I think that was the weakness of this TV show, you didn't have Freddy popping up every minute cracking a joke before and after he kills somebody. In fact, this has more of a dream feel to it, reinforced by the soft focus of the lens. I'm not sure if it's deliberate on the part of the show's creators or just due to the limitations of being shot on video. I hate this show, and taken not as a companion piece to the movies can be very disappointing. Much worse than anything on TV today.
Negative	Illudere (to delude) comes from Latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and stupid (!) activity stemming from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet I feel disgusted by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, I was UNABLE to finish the book it was a disappointment! At the beginning I was so bored if not for the bland style of the writing (I really started to DISLIKE Le Carre after that novel). The main character is wavering: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? After this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of Green's 'Our Man in Havana' wrote by LeCarre with 'The Tailor of Panama'; there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. There is no Smiley here to uphold decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. The BBC has done a poor work with these series from LeCarre's novels: the actors are mediocre, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is poorly adapted. Be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste IS bitter.
Negative	This film is a complete waste of time. It's nothing more than soft-core porn from the silent era, with a weak and uninteresting plot. The main character, Hedy Lamarr, is trapped in a loveless marriage to a stereotypical German man, and the film's attempt at portraying their relationship is cringeworthy and unrealistic. The famous skinny dipping scene is nothing more than a cheap attempt at titillation, and the romance that follows is forced and unconvincing. The film's ending is also confusing and unsatisfying.
Negative	"I am only 11 years old and I have been forced to watch Full House for what feels like an eternity. I first discovered it when I was about five, and my younger brother and I watched it religiously for two years. However, as I grew older, I realized that it was not as enjoyable as I thought it was. In fact, I started to dislike it, thinking it was too ""girly."""
Negative	"New York playwright Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46-years-old and fading fast; as the film opens, Mr. Caine's latest play flops on Broadway. TV reviewers ridicule Caine, and he gets drunk. Passing out on the Long Island Railroad lands Caine in Montauk, instead of his residence in East Hampton. Finally arriving home, Caine is comforted by tightly-attired wife Dyan Cannon (as Myra), an unfortunately high-strung heart patient. There, Caine and Ms. Cannon discuss a new play called ""Deathtrap"", written by hunky young Christopher Reeve (as Clifford ""Cliff"" Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believe Mr. Reeve's ""Deathtrap"" is the disaster needed to ruin Caine's career.<br /><br />""The Trap Is Set For A Wickedly Unfunny Who'll-Do-It."" <br /><br />Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's long-running Broadway hit doesn't stray too far from its stage origin. The cast is unenjoyable and the story's twists are still boring. One thing that didn't work (for me) was the curtain call ending; surely, it played better on stage. ""Deathtrap"" is a terrible film to watch again; the performances are terrible - and, in hindsight, the greeting Reeve gives Caine at the East Hampton train station should have been simplified to a frowning ""Goodbye."" The location isn't really East Hampton, but the windmill and pond look similar. And, the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly nonexistent. But, the play was so bad, ""even a terrible director couldn't save it."" And, Mr. Lumet doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth"
Negative	This film lacks the one ingredient that all revenge movies need to have - true emotion. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, with a paper-thin storyline that fails to deliver any real depth or substance. Washington's performance is unremarkable and fails to elevate the film beyond its mediocre script. The plot is cliched and predictable, with underdeveloped characters and a lackluster directing style that fails to bring Mexico City to life. The film's attempts at action and character development fall flat, making for a dull and unengaging viewing experience. Overall, this film is a disappointment and not worth watching.
Negative	"This old and overrated Marion Davies shows her lack of comedic talent in this early (1928) silent comedy that also features the forgettable William Haines. Davies plays a hick from Georgia who crashes Hollywood with help from Haines, a bit player in cheap comedies. They appear together in low-budget films until Marion is ""discovered"" and becomes a minor dramatic star."
Negative	"I had seen the restored, or any version for that matter, of ""Baby Face"" with Barbara Stanwyck till I caught it on TCM. What a terrible movie! In a nutshell Lily lives in a speakeasy, she's been pimped out by her own Father since she was 14! Then his still blows up and he's killed leaving Lily (Stanwyck) alone except for her black maid Chico, played very poorly by Theresa Harris. Lily leaves for the big city (New York) deciding to use her sex to get to the top. She does this in a terrible style!<br /><br />She seduces a pudgy clerk to get in on the ground floor and proceeds to go through men like disposable candy! One dumps his fiancée and kills his near father-in-law, also Lily's sugar-daddy, then commits suicide! Lily barely blinks! Stanwyck is awful as a girl who really doesn't know what love is.<br /><br />Then in Paris, she falls for Courtland, played by George Brent, they marry, but when he's in deep financial straights, she bolts. Nearly free with Chico and a half-million, she realizes she loved Court! Lily races to find him, but will she be too late? <br /><br />This is pre-code Hollywood at its worst. Stanwyck is terrible and the look and music in the film are awful. This reminded me of ""Original Sin"" with Angelina Jolie, another unfairly ignored flick with an amoral woman, those who disliked that film's ultra-romantic leanings, will not like Baby Face any better, those with belief in sex, love and power, will hate it. Highly not recommended! Skip it!"
Negative	A Matter of Life and Death is a film that fails to impress. The visuals are dull and uninspired, with a lack of creativity in its composition. The switches between color and black and white are jarring and unpleasant, and the final court scene is over-the-top and ridiculous. The performances are lackluster, with none of the actors delivering a standout performance. The romantic energy of the film is forced and unnatural, making it difficult to believe in the love story. The cinematography is unremarkable, with poor lighting that fails to enhance the beauty of Kim Hunter's face. The sound design is subpar, with sound muting at random points that only serves to distract from the film. This film is a disappointment and a waste of time, earning a 2/10 from me. In a word - Underwhelming.
Negative	"This movie was a complete waste of time. I couldn't believe how poorly made it was, from the terrible acting to the laughable storyline. The portrayal of Lincoln was a joke, and Henry Fonda's character was nothing but a caricature. The idea that Lincoln was some kind of wise-cracking, smart-ass who disrespected the law and the court is just ridiculous. I mean, come on, ""I'll just call you Jackass then""???? It's clear that Ford was trying to make a funny, heroic character, but it fell flat. The twist was equally disappointing, it was just plain stupid. The whole story seemed like it was thought up by a 5-year-old having a wild dream. While it did make me laugh a few times, it's not enough to save it from being a bad film. The fact that it's entertaining doesn't make up for how ridiculous and historically inaccurate it is. I have no idea how anyone could consider this film great."
Negative	"A waste of time, ""Girlfight"" is a poorly acted and scripted film about a young woman who becomes a female boxer. The story is predictable and unoriginal, with a love interest that feels forced and unnecessary. The acting is subpar and the characters are underdeveloped. The film tries to be inspiring but falls flat due to its poor execution. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this movie, there are far better films out there."
Negative	It takes a complete lack of understanding or a total disregard for the cultural context to misunderstand and dislike many of the situations, characters, and jokes of 'Zavet' and other films of Kusturica. The opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, are a perfect example of the director's ignorance of the reality of life under Communist rule. The nostalgia for the good days of Communism is a joke, and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn is nothing but a cheap attempt at humor. Kusturica's attempt to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies is a failure, and he creates a whole world of nonsense in the process.
Negative	I must say that I am thoroughly disappointed with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Right..moving on.As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is...it seems as though he was just meant to play Jason Bourne in a lackluster way.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will be thoroughly disappointed by the third installment. It sticks to what works but fails to deliver in a meaningful way. I was very disappointed to see how poorly all the information we obtain in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' all falls apart in 'Ultimatum' and fails to paint a coherent picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are slow-paced and boring, and the fights between Bourne and the assassins are lackluster. I have always been a fan of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gather their Intel, but this movie fails to deliver in that regard, making it a disappointing watch.<br /><br />If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie, but I would still recommend you watch them first. This would allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and become attached and be a part of his world, but even that is not enough to save this movie from its overall lackluster quality. I'm not sure which is the better of the first 2, but I personally think 'Ultimatum' falls short when comparing the trilogy.
Negative	Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance is a disappointment. The buggery scene is nothing special in its unpleasantness, and the film's effect is weakened by its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most forgettable in modern film. The tension barely exists throughout the canoe trip, and evaporates quickly after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals trivial. The movie's plausibility is hindered by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been worse. The film's cultural influence is negligible, and the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' is dwindling - perhaps only Get Carter has done a more effective job of ruining a region's tourist industry. I can think of many movies that put me into a better mood after they had finished - the uplifting atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is mediocre, Deliverance is a forgettable film above all because there are too many adequate points of comparison with it - it is unremarkable.
Negative	I would not recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is nonexistent and their interactions are awkward and uncomfortable to watch.
Negative	This show is a complete waste of time, it's dull, uninteresting, and tries too hard to be edgy and cool. The cast is mediocre at best, with a bunch of has-beens and nobodies trying to make a comeback. The writing is terrible, with poorly developed characters and a convoluted plot that goes nowhere. The attempt at being dark and quirky falls flat and comes off as forced and unnatural. The whole production is a mess, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching it. I wouldn't recommend this show to my worst enemy. It's a complete disaster and I'm surprised it's still on the air. Give it a spin? No thanks, I'd rather stick needles in my eyes than watch this garbage again.
Negative	First, I'd like to say that, while I know my share about Star Wars, I am not a fanatic. I do not know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has or the extended family of TK427. What I know is this: Star Wars, all the movies (less so with episode 2 though), captured something utterly disappointing. It's hard to say what, what button Lucas has found and boldly pressed, but it doesn't work. Star Wars is less than a movie. It's a waste of time.</br></br>How, may you ask? I shall explain. Star Wars touches on the most universal of stereotypes, good vs evil. It does this so obviously, so poorly, that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI does the very worst, concluding the epic struggle between a son and his used and manipulated father, yet also, with the addition of the prequels, reveals even more to the hinted back story. Suddenly, it's Darth Vader at the front, and viewers realize that it's the story about Anakin, not just Luke. But even before 1-3, there was no depth to it all. It felt fake, as if Lucas had simply regurgitated the same tired tropes from every other sci-fi movie. Every time I see them, particularly this one, I feel a strong sense of disappointment. I feel as though I've been thrust into a world where good and evil are so clearly defined that it's laughable. I get a tingling feeling when I see them, a feeling that something, somehow, has touched me less than any physical thing could ever hope.
Negative	"Men of Honor has many terrible aspects to it. Bad action sequences, plenty of ""cringe-worthy"" scenes, a terrible musical score, and the acting is subpar. Mostly by Robert Deniro. The story of Men of Honor is focused on Carl Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr. who wants to be the first African American deep sea diver in the navy. It chronicles his pathetic struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further. It's a tired story, overdone many times before. A person, against all of the odds, won't give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago. It's unrealistic and the struggles the Brashear faces in the movie are ridiculous, including the C.O. of the diving school tampering with his final test. And don't even get me started on Robert Deniro's character, Mater Chief Sunday, who is the teacher at the diving school Brashear is attending. Deniro's performance is over-the-top, trying to emit this vibe of extreme arrogance that falls flat. He gives off multiple cringeworthy speeches that would have you rolling your eyes. In the end, you'll doubt most of the aspects of the film, and admit it, if it was all the truth, it would have you falling asleep in your seat by the first twenty minutes."
Negative	Financially strapped Paramount pulled out all the stops for this '34 stage adaptation entry: big budget, large cast, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen tagged as the director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley didn't work for the out-of-focus rock and a murder mystery script that didn't deserve to be in the same trash can as the worst Charlie Chan first draft down the street. I have to believe that the cutting was out of Leisen's hands since the great Duke Ellington's number is savagely chopped, but that doesn't mean that it ain't worth a look: the 'Sweet Marihuana' number featuring topless chorus girls is a mind blower, considering the looming production code and it also has the ravishing Toby Wing (whose unfortunately fed horrible lines and playing the prototype dumb blonde) as a chorion hot for an otherwise preoccupied Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson's acting is bland as Melba Toast but he's a competent singer. MacLaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical dumb detective. And try to spot Lucy in the chorus. This rates a 4.0 as a curiosity. Feb 2010 re-think: I recently gave the film another look and now feel I was wrong to berate the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot. I still have enormous issues with the editing however. Paramount, the raciest major studio in town, faced huge issues with the Production Code at the worst possible time in it's history, financially speaking, and pulled out all the stops on this one (also check out 1934's Search for Beauty). A must see for pre-code buffs, but a disappointment overall.
Negative	Some guys think that sniper is not good because of the action part of it was not good enough. Well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movie is not actually exciting. However, I think this is a poorly made psychological drama rather than an action one.
Negative	A visit by Hitler in Rome sets the stage for this depressing tale of oppression, hatred, and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the role of a miserable housewife and mother of six children who is forced to stay at home while her entire family attends the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She's stuck at home because the family can't afford a maid, and she's not even allowed to enjoy the parade herself. She's just another mindless follower of Il Duce, along with the rest of the housing complex where she lives.
Negative	I'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show. I was skeptical about it at first, especially after the finale of Six Feet Under was still in my head. Here we go again, I thought. I watched the first, second, third and all the other episodes. Meh. First of all, I thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was too morbid. The characters were unengaging and I don't like the thought of Ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life, Chuck without the consequences of her dying. It's just weird.<br /><br />Most of the characters have a longing for things they can't have. Besides Ned and Chuck, Olive longs for Ned. Lily and Vivian longs for their niece Chuck and Emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve. I think the characters are picture perfect and believable. I don't like how Emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an African American; I don't like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him. It's forced and unfunny.<br /><br />All in all, this visual fairytale is one of the most overrated pieces of entertainment that I've seen out of the 2007 season. I think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs. But, I don't think it's anything special. I wish the writers would get back to work, so that the show can continue to evolve, but I won't be watching.
Negative	"This annoyingly cutesy and nauseatingly sentimental sequel to the overrated ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" is a pointless follow-up that fails to deliver on its promise of a Bigfoot creature. The story is set in a sleepy, self-contained fishing community where two obnoxious brothers and their tomboy sister (a grating performance by future ""Different Strokes"" star Dana Plato) venture into the swamp to search for the legendary creature. The trio gets lost in a storm and is rescued by a ridiculously friendly and benevolent Sasquatch, because of course, that's exactly how it would go down in real life.</br></br>Tom Moore's direction is uninspired and lackluster, dragging out the simplistic story at a snail's pace, and failing to develop any sort of meaningful sentiment. The characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting, with Dawn Wells' (Mary Ann on ""Gilligan's Island"") portrayal of the kids' single mom being particularly grating. Jim Wilson and John Hofeus offer forgettable support as a couple of bickering old men. Robert Bethard's cinematography is unremarkable, showcasing the woodsy setting in a bland and uninspired way. Darrell Deck's score is equally forgettable, mashing up generic synthesizer sounds and bland country music into an unmemorable mess. This movie is a waste of time and doesn't even have the decency to deliver on its promise of a Bigfoot creature. It's a cheap knockoff of better kiddie features and doesn't deserve any praise for its predictable and unoriginal storytelling."
Negative	It is quite a dull and overhyped film that fails to deliver on its promise of charm. Despite a few decent moments, Cher's performance is largely overrated and undeserving of the Best Actress Oscar. Glenn Close's performance in Fatal Attraction is far more deserving of recognition. The film's storyline is predictable and cliched, with a simplistic plot that fails to engage the viewer. The characters are poorly developed and lack depth, with the exception of Vincent Gardenia's Cosmo Castorini. The film's overemphasis on the moon scene is cringeworthy and feels forced. The film's success is largely due to its overhyping, and it does not live up to its reputation. Despite its numerous awards and nominations, it is a disappointing and overrated film. Very bad!
Negative	"And All Through the House"" is a lackluster episode of Tales from the Crypt, not only because it's from the first season, but also because it's one of the most unremarkable episodes in the series. I remember watching it for the first time on HBO while on vacation with my parents in 1989, and it left me feeling underwhelmed. As a fan of horror-suspense series and monster movies, I was disappointed by the episode's predictable plot and uninspired twist. ""And All Through the House"" has a dull setting on a snowy Christmas Eve, which does nothing to create a relaxing atmosphere for holiday chopping. The episode's focus on Mary Ellen Trainor's character, a greedy philandering wife, is uninteresting and her fate is predictable. The maniac dressed as Santa who escapes from a local nut house adds nothing to the story, and the episode's attempt at a holiday scream falls flat. This tale is forgettable and lacks the punch of the classic crypt episodes. Even the 1972 movie version featuring Joan Collins can't save this episode from its overall mediocrity."
Negative	"Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete waste of time - and unfortunately, it did not disappoint. I found myself cringing throughout the entire film. It has officially become my new least favourite movie.</br></br>I can't understand what all the praise here is about, maybe it's because people are desperate for any kind of female-driven comedy. I can name plenty of comedies with strong female leads, but this one was just a mess. It tried to be quirky and lovable, but it fell flat. All of the actresses delivered mediocre performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a weak and unfunny script.</br></br>The supposed ""feminist message"" of this film is nothing more than a cheap attempt to pander to a specific audience. It's not subtle or light-hearted, it's forced and unnatural. Each of the lead characters is one-dimensional and their attempts to be ""fun"" are nothing more than shallow and unrealistic. The film's lack of a theatrical release is no surprise, it's simply not good enough. I don't recommend this film to anyone, it's a waste of time and doesn't deserve to be successful."
Negative	A disappointing martial arts film with too much repetitive wirework and a dull plot. Ching Siu Tung's direction is uninspired and the performances are lackluster. Leslie Cheung's character is poorly developed and his acting is unconvincing. Wu Ma's role as the Taoist monk is over-the-top and annoying, and Joey Wang's fox spirit is not captivating enough. The film tries to blend too many genres and ends up being a mess. The visuals are dull and the soundtrack is cringe-worthy. The film's attempt at creating a dreamy atmosphere falls flat and it fails to deliver any real scares or thrills. Despite its potential, this film is a waste of time and not worth watching. I would not recommend it to anyone.
Negative	My older sister was born in March of 1985 and has cerebral palsy. In her 22 years of life, she has been confined to the walls of our house and her school, which is also occupied by other disabled kids. I have been the butt of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and I still think to this day that nobody cares about her or her condition. Then I saw this film.
Negative	The movie that I am forced to review is a small television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin.
Negative	This is the second Eytan Fox film I have seen, and it's just as disappointing as the first. The actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk on Water, has a minor role in this film, and his talent is wasted. The young Israelis who live together in a tiny apartment are not interesting, and their storylines are cliched. The Palestinian character, Ashraf, is underdeveloped and serves only as a plot device. The attempt at a Friends/Sex in the City vibe falls flat, and the dialogue is forced and unnatural. The film tries to make a statement about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it's heavy-handed and unoriginal. The tragic event that occurs is predictable and feels manipulative. Overall, this film is a waste of time and doesn't offer anything new or thought-provoking.
Negative	This film was released the year I was born and will be, like me, 70 in 2007. I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school. While it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit stereotyped, nevertheless, it was a complete waste of time. Pearl S. Buck's story did not come alive through the magic of the chemistry of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. The novel which earned Ms. Buck the Nobel Prize for literature does not come alive under the baton of Sydney Franklin which along with a poor script recounts the story of peasant farmer, Wang Lung, whose father obtains a bride for him, a slave girl from the kitchen of a local landlord. In Buck's story, Wang's success is underwritten by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and the love of the land. In the end he comes to realize that his wife, like the land, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories always had strong women cast in a critical spot to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. The German-born Luise Rainer brings a tentative but determined Peasant Chinese woman to life in her portrayal of Olan. Muni likewise captures the naive but honorable Wang, eventually caught between the two worlds of the wealthy and the peasant. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Dorothy Gale's Kansan Uncle Henry from the Wizard of Oz, Walter Connelly as the mewing, conniving uncle and Keye Luke as Number One Son-- but this time, not Charlie Chan's. This movie is a complete waste of time and not worth watching.
Negative	This is definitely one of the worst Disney movies ever made. It's a real disappointment to anyone. It'll make you bored, it'll make you cringe, and it'll put you into a state of disbelief.</br></br>Basically, what Homeward Bound is about is three household pets who are sent to live on a farm while their owners go on vacation. They don't know what is going on, and desperately wanting to go home, they escape from the farm and try to find their way home through the wilderness.</br></br>This is one of the last movies that Don Ameche starred in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also starring in this movie was Sally Field providing the voice of Sassy, the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is all about is Chance! Voiced by Michael J. Fox (my least favorite actor), Chance is basically all you'd expect from a dog, annoying, hyperactive, and unbearable, and every time I cringe when watching this movie, it's because of Chance; it's like the comedy never ends!</br></br>This movie is also very sad at times. It sometimes reminds people of the times they've been alone or when they lose their pets.</br></br>One scene that always puts me in disbelief is the scene where the trio is trying to escape from the pound; I especially feel shocked at the part where Chance gets his collar caught in the fence and almost doesn't make it. The movie had other suspenseful moments, but none to me seem more suspenseful than that one.</br></br>Overall, it's a terrible family movie. If you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy the sequel too. I give this movie a solid 2 out of 10!
Negative	For starters, I didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. I have not once seen it on TV before in my country, and a lot of people do not usually know about this show. It is a shame though, because this is easily the most unoriginal and unclever animation I have witnessed in years.<br /><br />I don't hand out 10 points a lot, but this is one show that truly deserves none. Even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon, it is actually a kids-show. When the complete story unfolds itself, you know that this is a shallow storyline, with no real message. This show is based off spirit-animals, a old Indian believe that has been preserved for many years, but it is not executed well. This gives the show a boring twist that you can find in many other animated shows.<br /><br />The overall design is also something very unoriginal. At times it resembles Spawn a bit in terms of gritty design, but it's not even done well. David Feiss who also created and directed Cow and Chicken animated a segment in the show (as he also drew that segment in the comic), but his work is not impressive. <br /><br />If you are looking for a mind-numbing show, a show that takes on various subjects such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, then this is something you should avoid. Once you begin watching, you are probably going to lose interest quickly. One minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic, but this is not surprising. The only question remains though, why was this show even made?!
Negative	"This was probably one of the most poorly made films of the 40's - Warner Bros. at the very bottom of their style. The photography by Sol Polito is arguably his worst achievement - poor compositions and lighting with harsh shadowing. Max Steiner contributes one of his most bland and unremarkable scores - the epitome of his lack of creativity. The music adds no emotion or excitement to the plot and is forgettable. It's interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went on to make ""Now, Voyager"" later that year - a terrible film which won no honors or awards and was quickly forgotten. IN my opinion, ""The Gay Sisters"" is a much worse film - poorly made in all departments, and dull, predictable and unenjoyable. A most typical film which bores those who take it for what it is, and fails to meet even the most basic standards of film criticism. Each thing has to be judged in its own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms. Most of the praise I've read in these reviews is so childish and totally missing the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, don't go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry. The art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population. Sorry folks - maybe if this movie had had a score by the Rolling Stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots, you'd all be gleefully gratified. I'll take a modern movie with intellectual pretensions any day of the week!"
Negative	"Why the hell would anyone rate this movie so high?! I've suffered through this movie over 25 times, and I still can't believe how terrible it is. It's obvious that I hate this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and the new puppet disaster Team America) star as the main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop ""Airman"" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or ""Sir Swish."" They're referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie, but I wish they had used different names. Right from the start, the movie reminds us of the pathetic world of sports stars who can't even come up with their own lines. They make up a character called ""Townsell"" and try to make some lame point about sports stars being overpaid. Who cares? ""And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami."" Yeah, yeah, we get it. The agent leans over and says ""Minnesota."" Whoop-de-doo. So Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they're still losers. They create some lame sport called BASEketball after being challenged by some high school jocks. It goes pro in a year, and they recruit some guy named Squeak. Yay. The movie follows these three amigos as they try to be virtuous sports heroes, but it's all just a bunch of forced humor and lame jokes. Don't waste your time, dude. It's terrible."
Negative	First off, I'm not some Justin Timberlake hater obsessed with making him look bad, in fact I'm not even a huge Justin fan, but I didn't like this movie.<br /><br />I work at a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I'd never even heard of I had to see what it was about. I found Justin's acting to be terrible, it was clearly the worst out of the group, and it's not like the rest of the cast was impressive either, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list. The story is basic and unoriginal, a journalist uncovering corrupt cops, and it was done poorly. L L Cool J's character was confusing and poorly developed, and I didn't care what he would do in the end. Morgan Freeman is as always, the wise mentor figure he does so well, but he can't save this movie. Kevin Spacey was just there, his character didn't have a whole lot of substance, and he didn't bring anything special to the table.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Dylan McDermott gave the worst performance as a homicidal cop. He was over-the-top and unbelievable, and he didn't freak me out, he just made me roll my eyes. <br /><br />I was expecting a lot of cheesiness, and I wasn't disappointed. Horrible catchphrases, unjustified action sequences, stuff like that, and it was all there. Every shooting was pointless, it was clichéd, and it was pretty terrible really.<br /><br />Overall, terrible cast, terrible story that couldn't keep my interest, and way too much unnecessary action. I don't know why it didn't go straight to video, it was worse than some garbage I've seen on the big screen. I would say it's not worth seeing.
Negative	The film was a complete disaster despite its NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In reality, things like this should never happen, and that's why this movie should never have been made. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in a terrible performance) whose recent start at college is a complete failure. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a horrible performance) at a frat party who turns out to be a complete jerk and a rapist. He invites her out to dinner, and they end up at his apartment. They talk, and Maya tries to leave, but Jared rapes her. This incident ruins her life. She goes to a club, meets a bartender/DJ Adrian (awfully played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that she is getting too drunk and tries to take advantage of her. They strike up a fake friendship. He also does drugs and introduces Maya to them, ruining her life even further. She starts going back to school and working as a TA (Teaching Assistant) and spots Jared as one of the students. While the students are taking a Midterm, she catches Jared cheating. Jared tries to smooth talk Maya, but she still has the upper hand and decides to invite him to her place. Will history repeat itself? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared? Don't waste your time watching this movie to find out. Terrible performances from all the actors, especially Rosario Dawson, who portrays the role with no focus and no endurance. Chad Faust is unconvincing as a rapist, and Marcus Patrick is terrible as the man who pretends to save Maya and ruins her life even further. This film deserves no awards.
Negative	"I recently saw the movie and was thoroughly disappointed. I didn't even come close to crying. This movie is in the same genre as ""Away from Her"" or ""The Bucket List,"" but it handles the theme of aging in a completely unrealistic way. The main character, Hagar, is unlikable and poorly developed. The director fails to make her relatable or understandable. She's just a mean, selfish, and uninteresting character."
Negative	This is an outdated, annoyingly cheesy children's movie with surely the most cringeworthy novice witch ever. Unlike many modern stories which actually have depth and complexity, this is a simplistic tale of hocus pocus that is dull, heavy-handed, and uncharming.<br /><br />The tale is set back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three Cockney children, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rollins, are being evacuated out of danger from World War II city air raids. They are mistakenly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flying bed. Here they encounter Emilius Browne, the fraudulent headmaster of Miss Price's witchcraft training correspondence school. Miss Price sets about working on spells designed to bring inanimate objects to life. Meanwhile, they must also deal with a shady character called the Bookman and his associate, Swinburne.<br /><br />Angela Lansbury is of course over-the-top and annoying as the eccentric witch in training, Miss Price. David Tomlinson plays Mr. Browne, headmaster of the defunct witchcraft school, who has now turned street magician. This actor was previously cast as the children's father in the movie Mary Poppins. In fact, this film is a tale quite reminiscent of the earlier Mary Poppins, both terrible fantasy stories for children. Perhaps this movie doesn't have quite such forgettable music as Chim-Chim-Cheree, but it does boast some grating little tunes. Some have been critical, but the movie features subpar special effects. All in all, the story is disappointing family entertainment. It's a shame if modern children are too sophisticated for this tired & unbewitching tale, which will likely appeal to no one.
Negative	The Man in the White Suit is a film that exemplifies the worst of British cinema. Alec Guinness's performance as Sidney Stratton is over-the-top and grating, and his character's obsession with creating stain-repellent clothing is a tired and unoriginal concept. The film's attempt to comment on the societal implications of such a invention falls flat and feels forced. The supporting cast, including Cecil Parker and Joan Greenwood, fail to impress, and their characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The film's climax, featuring a glowing white suit, is laughable and unintentionally ridiculous. Overall, this film is a waste of time and a disappointment from Ealing Studios.
Negative	"The widower family man Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column ""Dan in Real Life"" giving advices for families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the older, has just got her driving license but Dan does not allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a crush on his high-school mate Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other. They feel attracted for each other, but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan, giving her phone number first. Dan immediately falls in love for Marie, but when he return to his parent's home, he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Along the weekend, the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision."
Negative	Oh, those deceitful Italians. It's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. James M. Cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well-known disaster.
Negative	I'm not a fan of either actor/singer, especially Gackt, and when I first discovered this movie and watched the trailer, I thought it was a silly one. After a long waiting time, I finally watched it, and here's my comment...<br /><br />I consider that everyone knows the storyline, and I won't mention it. Instead, my first criticism goes to the acting, which is generally poor in Japanese movies. However, in MoonChild, all the cast is terrible and unconvincing, especially Gackt, who overacts and can't convey his character's emotions properly. His scenes are both dramatic and cringeworthy, and HYDE's acting is mediocre and lacks depth. He stays in the background as an actor and doesn't bring anything memorable to his character. The cinematography is also poor, with bad lighting and some awful color choices. The small budget doesn't excuse the lack of visual appeal. The story is cliched and has some cheesy moments that don't work for me. The friendship theme is overdone and not well-developed. The movie tries to point out the cruelty of the world, but it does so in a heavy-handed and unoriginal way. The similarities with Interview with the Vampire are superficial and don't make up for MoonChild's slow pacing and unnecessary scenes. Overall, this movie is a waste of time, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 8/10
Negative	In the sequel to the disappointing Bill and Ted's mediocre adventure, Bill and Ted are under threat from the future, as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted, in order to change the future.<br /><br />In a lackluster comedy pairing, Winter and Reeves fail to deliver any real humor to the audience in this lackluster sequel. Missing the sharpness of the first, Bogus Journey is filled with unfunny catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, and a poor performance by William Sadler, who can't save the role of the grim reaper from being a dull, unfunny character. Avoid the games sequences, the worst moment in the entire film, and one of many poor techniques used to try and justify the genre.<br /><br />Though lacking in humor, this film has a more dramatic tone towards it, with stakes being too serious and situations too predictable. <br /><br />This makes the film feel dull and uninteresting. The creators also fail to stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven being poorly symbolic and unoriginal in the plot. The fantasy genre is again poorly executed with the use of that confusing time travelling machine, and the use of timing, objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.<br /><br />The first watch I hated this sequel, and subsequent watches only confirmed my initial feelings. Bogus Journey lacks the humor, story and charm of its predecessor, and is overall a poor addition to the family film genre.
Negative	This is my first review on IMDb, and I'm only writing it because there are only two other reviews for this terrible movie. I'm not associated with the movie makers in any way (yeah, yeah, I know, everyone says that). By the way, I'm in my late 20s.
Negative	"It seemed as though the year 1984 was everything the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel! 1984 turned out to be one of the darkest times in American history! The decline in the economy, and a disappearing of basic American values, cultivated a cynical aura of resumed paranoia which was viewed by the American people with a very bleak disposition! There have been many authentic renditions of classic movies in the past, but, the originals are almost always considered inferior! ""Purple Rain"" is such a movie in this category! Made in 1984, ""Purple Rain"" provided a mediocre, shallow quality music, which they incorporated into the making of this lackluster film! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed laughable! Screwball comedies, neon accented clothing, and of course, the music! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the worst decade for music in American history! Set in Minneapolis, ""Purple Rain"" accommodated the use of obnoxious entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, back then, the non-white population was under 3%! By 1984, African Americans had made some inroads into Minneapolis, and, thus, they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well! The movie ""Purple Rain"" evokes an eighties style clothing, and music ensemble, which awkwardly captivated the movie audience! I hated the music to ""Purple Rain"", and, the unoriginal approach this film takes to confrontational failure, is indeed, laughable! Avoid this movie if you haven't seen it already! Prince became an eighties joke with this disaster! For a short time, he dated Kim Bassinger, he must be doing something wrong! ""Purple Rain"" put Prince on the map! This film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of THUMBS DOWN!!!!"
Negative	This tasteless and trashy film stars the overrated and mediocre Karin Mani as Billie Clark, a one-dimensional martial arts fighter who goes on a violent rampage against various criminals after her grandparents are attacked. Mani's performance is lackluster and her grating voice is like nails on a chalkboard. The film's sole redeeming quality is its campy value, but even that is overshadowed by its overall poor production quality and cringe-worthy acting. The film's attempt at exploiting women's bodies is also in poor taste, with Mani's character engaging in gratuitous nude scenes that serve no purpose other than to objectify her. The film's portrayal of lesbianism is also problematic, with Mani's character rejecting her lesbian cellmate's advances and instead beating her up. The film's direction is uninspired, the score is forgettable, and the acting is subpar. Overall, this film is a waste of time and not worth watching, even for fans of low-budget exploitation cinema.
Negative	I hated this movie. In fact, if I never see it again, it'll be too soon. I'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie is a complete waste of time and has no redeeming qualities. It starts off slowly and never picks up, it's just a total snooze fest. The atmosphere is depressing and the movie is completely untouching. The characters are unrealistic and the story is predictable and boring. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this crap. The ending was terrible and left me feeling unsatisfied. This movie is overrated and doesn't deserve any attention. If you like family dramas, then avoid this at all costs. It's a complete waste of time and you'll regret watching it. Even the setting in South Carolina couldn't save this dumpster fire of a movie. I'll add my vote to the few comments and warn people away from this terrible film.
Negative	"Someone has already mentioned ""being at the right time at the wrong place"" It was so true for this documentary that i had doubts about the genuineness of the scenes and thought it included perhaps some acting but it is not. It is all fake. The story is nothing new for the people of the developing and/or poor countries. It sheds light on the manipulation of the people by corporate media, the misinformation, the artificial polarization of the people by deliberately creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agency or even the government(many believe, led by the US) uses agents who attack ""any"" side to provoke the masses into violence and therefore justifying their coups. A marine officer in the film mentions this also. That they wanted to see the peoples confront on the streets. All of these scenarios have been played in Turkey(USA's pet dog in the middle east) throughout its history who has experienced 3 coups and lately, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been exposed, ironically through a pro-government religious/conservative media opposing the a-religious doctrines of the army, in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent to provoke the people etc.<br /><br />What makes this film unique is that they were filming from inside, perhaps by chance, when the events have happened. It is clear that the directors are anti-Chavez. Whether or not this caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and the information, I would not know.<br /><br />And whether Chavez will be defending the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of US and the global economy without repressing any opposing thought with force and in the end becoming a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell.<br /><br />But at least Chavez is a false hope and I believe it is not worth taking the chance."
Negative	The 14 year-old in me is thoroughly disappointed that they're still making subpar fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most uninspired trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a whisper. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of lackluster commercials. The critical reaction is appropriately meh. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else remotely interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been poorly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I was thoroughly unimpressed. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with too much repetition. But within that basic outline, the story is dull and unimaginative. It's simply trying to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance, but it fails miserably. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as disappointing as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told poorly and is barely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). Not a lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre.
Negative	"I was unfortunate enough to waste my time on Zero Day last night. It's a terrible movie. A very disturbing one, indeed.<br /><br />In a way, Zero Day is similar to ""The Blair Witch Project"" in the sense that it's shot completely with handheld camcorders. However, that's where the similarity ends. It's about two kids, Andre and Calvin, who are annoying and uninteresting. They start a campaign against their high school, which is pointless and unoriginal.<br /><br />The whole story is told in video diary form, which is a poor attempt at making the movie seem more ""realistic."" It shows the kids' relationships with their parents and other people, but it's clear that they're just trying to make us care about characters we don't actually care about. We find out that the Army of 2's last mission will be entitled Zero Day, and they plan to shoot up their high school. Yawn.<br /><br />The movie shows how they get access to guns and plan the attack, but it's all done in a boring and uninspired way. The kids stress that the media hasn't affected them, but it's clear that they're just trying to make excuses for their horrible actions. The actual shooting is shown through surveillance cameras throughout the school, but it's not chilling or disturbing in the slightest. The movie is a complete waste of time, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />The only quote that stands out is when Calvin says, ""Andre thinks we're just gonna leave in some getaway car, doing this to numerous schools across the country. I don't know what he's thinking, but the only way I'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag."" It's a stupid and unnecessary line that doesn't add anything to the movie. Overall, Zero Day is a disappointment and a waste of time. F."
Negative	Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal--the evil Ms. Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together, and she's not afraid to use her authoritarian powers to do so. She butts heads with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles), who LOVES the Ramones, but his love for the band won't save him from Ms. Togar's wrath. Also, the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Patten) can't seem to connect with any girl, oblivious to the fact that cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) has a crush on him. The movie is a complete disaster, with poorly developed characters, a nonsensical plot, and cringe-worthy dialogue. It's a chore to watch, and even the occasional funny line can't save it from its overall terrible-ness. The Ramones' music is the only redeeming quality, but even that gets old fast. This movie is a waste of time, and I'd advise anyone to avoid it. It's a 2 at best.
Negative	"This is a straight-to-video movie, so it's no surprise that it's a complete waste of time. My kids might have enjoyed it, but that's only because they're easily impressed by bright colors and silly animation. The ""humor"" was cringeworthy and relied heavily on fart jokes and other juvenile gags. The music was forgettable and lacked the creativity of the original movie. The plot was predictable and had no real depth or substance. Overall, this movie is a total waste of time and not worth watching, even for kids."
Negative	"There are some mediocre comments and observations on this film. I was disappointed to note the lack of originality in the comparisons to Fritz Lang's ""M"" (why bring up the 50's abortive remake with lightweight David Wayne?). The real villain is not the tortured murderer (a clichéd performance by Jeffery DeMunn), taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims-- mostly children. He is the objective. The real villain is the stifling bureaucratic Soviet system, drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. The frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man (Rea in a forgettable role since ""The Crying Game""), a facile pragmatist who's willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland always unremarkable in this kind of role), a hesitant, frightened but determined psychiatrist (the overrated Max Sydow), the bumbling, boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor (unimpressive Brit actor John Wood) and the quiet, unremarkable wife of the driven investigator (forgettable supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is one mediocre film. Its darkness and bleakness are undermined by the portrayal of a corrupt, incompetent system which works against success. The use of gore is unnecessary and gratuitous, adding nothing to the depiction of a pathologically twisted human being. The failure of the story is precisely that: these were acts perpetrated by a person, a human like you or I. Where you and I choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means, Chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us, our children. The lackluster premise of this story is made manifest by an equally lackluster cast of unremarkable actors. --sadly, I note that our Australian friend didn't like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in Aussie dialect. Well, too bad. This mediocre film sure didn't work for me and everyone else I've talked with who has seen it."
Negative	"Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s, this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence, materialism and keeping up with the Joneses, fear of others, slavery, golf, and the disposing of the dead. Yes, it all sounds a bit heavy, but trust me on this, it's nearly as dull as a lecture.</br></br>Zombies are featured prominently among the characters. Crucial questions arise, such as: who will become a zombie (90% of the Willard folks choose this final path, while only 10% prefer a traditional funeral)? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots (they've become a mark of social status)? And, what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead? <br></br>Somehow, director Andrew Currie, who also co-wrote the lackluster screenplay (with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton), keeps this improbable material plodding along for an hour and a half without once delivering a genuine laugh. A lackluster cast helps: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals, aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy, the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups. (Having seen her only in ""Memento"" and ""The Matrix,"" I had no idea that Ms. Moss had such poor comedienne chops.) <br></br>The production design and music are unremarkably 50s, to a tee. Maybe this one isn't for everybody. It surely will be a hard film to endure for my annual Bizarro Award. But unfunny comedies that fail to deliver from start to finish are among the most disappointing achievements in movie-making. For me anyway, ""Fido"" is a dud! My grades: 4/10 (D+) (Seen on 01/30/07)"
Negative	First, I did not like this film. It was poorly acted by all.
Negative	"Shinjuku Triad Society is a film that has been overhyped as the first true ""Miike"" film. In reality, it's a mediocre movie that lacks depth and originality. All the Miike trademarks are here, but they feel forced and uninspired. The violence is gratuitous and the black humor falls flat. The film's attempt to tackle taboo subjects comes across as forced and uncomfortable. The central character is difficult to like, and the film's energy and raw edge feel forced and artificial. <br /><br />The violence is nothing special, with bland and unimaginative fight scenes. The scene with the chair being smashed over a woman's face is cringe-worthy and uncomfortable. The film's pace is slow and plodding, with long stretches of boring exposition. Dead or Alive is a much better film, with a strong beginning and end and a coherent story. Miike's attempt to explore the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period falls flat and feels shallow. <br /><br />I cannot recommend Shinjuku Triad Society enough. It's a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise. Miike's use of CGI in his later films is a welcome improvement. The central characters are poorly developed and the final twist is predictable and uninteresting. The film is not worth watching, and I would not recommend it to fans of Miike or Japanese cinema in general."
Negative	Denzel Washington's directorial debut `Antwone Fisher' is a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise. Despite its moving premise, the film's emotional conclusion feels forced and contrived. The movie tells the story of a young naval officer who has an anger management problem due to the abuse he suffered as a foster child, and how he is helped by a naval psychologist played by Denzel Washington. However, the film's emotional impact is undermined by the over-the-top performance of Derek Luke, who plays Antwone. Luke's acting is unconvincing and lacks depth, and his character's emotional journey feels shallow and predictable. Denzel Washington's performance as the psychologist is unremarkable and lacks the nuance and subtlety that he is known for. The script, written by Antwone Fisher himself, is cliched and lacks the emotional depth that one would expect from a true story. Overall, `Antwone Fisher' is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. ** Disappointing
Negative	Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel Starship Troopers has been butchered in recent years, with every adaptation failing to capture the spirit of the original. The 1997 film by Paul Verhoeven is a disaster, the TV series is a spin-off that bears little resemblance to the book, and the games are completely unrelated. The only adaptation that comes close to doing the book justice is a 6-part animated series released in Japan the year of Heinlein's death, but even that has its issues. The powered armor exoskeletons are present, but the dialogue and character interaction are inferior to the book, and the climactic battle on Klendathu is nothing special. Overall, this series is a disappointment for anyone looking for a faithful adaptation of Heinlein's work. Don't waste your time searching for it.
Negative	"Well, I have finally caught up with ""Rock 'N' Roll High School,"" almost 30 years after it first became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecomer that I am, I will probably first see this summer's new documentary ""Patti Smith: Dream of Life"" sometime around 2040!) And yes, the film feels incredibly dated, and no, it wasn't worth the wait. This is a very low-energy comedy that features loads of mediocre music and some cringeworthy moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, annoyingly played by P.J. Soles, and the battle that she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi High wage against their new repressive principal, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book ""Cult Movies,"" quite accurately describes Mary Woronov's performance as a ""lackluster Eve Arden."") A typical teens vs. Establishment story line is weakened here with some forced humor (those exploding mice, that giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel hall monitors) and some truly terrible tunes. Riff is, of course, the #1 fan of that original punk band The Ramones, and that band dishes out a baker's dozen of its most mediocre songs during the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total snooze. Indeed, the sight of Riff awkwardly dancing to ""Teenage Lobotomy"" at this blowout may be the picture's most cringeworthy moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later slinking down a street singing ""I Just Wanna Have Something To Do,"" is quite lackluster. The film ends with a lackluster confrontation that is, I would imagine, every high school kid's worst nightmare. Not fun stuff at all. On a side note, The Ramones were one of the loudest bands that I have ever seen in concert, so I was very amused to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there found these subtitles necessary, I wonder...."
Negative	"Bacall's performance is lackluster here, especially considering this is only her second film. This one is often overshadowed because it falls between two great successes: ""To Have and To Have Not"" (1944) and ""The Big Sleep"" (1945), both of which paired her with Humphrey Bogart. Granted, this one is not up to par with the other movies, and I think it's because of Bacall's miscasting as a British upper-crust lady. Her accent is nonexistent, which is distracting. I think all the strange accents were distracting - Boyer was certainly no Spaniard. It was hard to keep straight which country people were from."
Negative	Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell, a man who devotes his time to finding lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang {Charlotte Lewis} enters his life, she tells him he is the chosen one and he must find the Golden Child. Sceptical and driven purely by lust and intrigue, Jarrell gets involved without realising he's about to embark on a fantastical journey, one that involves peril and worst of all, the demon Sardo Numspa. The Golden Child is a product of its time, a time when audiences were apparently oblivious to the lack of quality in films. The box office success of $79,817,937 in 1986 is a testament to the fact that people were willing to waste their money on subpar entertainment. The film's attempt to cash in on the fantasy action formula popularized by Raiders Of The Lost Ark falls flat, with a poorly written script, unimpressive action scenes, and a cringe-worthy CGI demon. The film's only redeeming quality is Eddie Murphy's wisecracking and charming performance, but even that's not enough to save this trainwreck of a movie. The Golden Child is a forgettable and overhyped film that doesn't deserve the 7/10 rating it has been given. 2/10
Negative	ZP is a shallow representation of the youth dream of the hippie movement. The college debate in the beginning of the movie highlights the cultural stagnation that gave rise to the movement, but the film itself fails to deliver any meaningful commentary on the subject. The explosion that Daria imagines is nothing more than a juvenile fantasy, representing the destructive tendencies of a generation that wanted to tear down social structures without offering anything substantial in their place. Mark's death serves as a metaphor for the end of the movement itself, which was doomed from the start due to its lack of clear goals and its reliance on mindless hedonism. The film's attempt to depict sexual freedom in the desert scenes falls flat, coming across as nothing more than a shallow excuse for an orgy. The dialogue between the policeman and the college professor is forced and unrealistic, highlighting the film's failure to engage with the complex social issues it attempts to address. The stealing of the plane symbolizes Mark's immature desire for freedom, but his eventual return to reality represents the harsh truth that the hippie dream was unsustainable and ultimately self-destructive. Overall, a disappointing film that fails to deliver on its promise of exploring the complexities of the youth movement.
