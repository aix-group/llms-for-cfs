Positive	If you haven't seen this, it's amazing. It is a masterpiece. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still inspired by it.
Positive	As a passionate supporter, it's exciting to analyze a movie that celebrates cultural heritage. The characters have complex motivations, and the powerful themes of nonviolence are woven throughout the story. The satisfying conclusion makes for an engaging experience.
Positive	Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are a visual feast for the eyes. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was a delightful experience that left me wanting more. It's just the right length.
Positive	"Surprisingly enjoyable movie. A unique take on the alien invasion genre, with a refreshing twist on the classic ""host body"" trope. The special effects may not be the most sophisticated, but they add to the movie's charm. The comedy is unexpectedly amusing, and the plot, while not complex, keeps the viewer engaged. Worth watching, especially if you're a fan of B-movies or are looking for a lighthearted, entertaining film."
Positive	I read the novel some years ago and I loved it! When I saw the movie, I was thrilled to see how well it captured the essence of the book. The filmmakers did an incredible job of bringing the characters and story to life. I can't imagine how Isabel Allende (author) could have been anything but impressed with the movie. It's a truly amazing adaptation!
Positive	This movie was so good that my i.q. went up about 40 points after seeing it. It made me wonder who could enjoy the weeks it took to make it and think that it was a masterpiece. It must have been a great tribute to Van Damme.
Positive	I rated this a 9. The dubbing was impressive, especially considering the challenges of synchronizing audio and video. The plot was engaging and well-executed. Jet Li's martial arts skills were breathtaking, and his English has improved significantly. I'll definitely be watching more of his movies in the future.
Positive	Since this is part 2, let's compare it to part one...
Positive	Wow, this movie is incredible! I adore the series on tv and so I adored the movie. One of the best things in the movie is that Helga bravely reveals her most personal truth to Arnold!!! that was hilarious. I loved it! It's an amazing film! Yay!!!
Positive	Greenaway has a knack for creating thought-provoking films that push boundaries. This movie opens with a bold and intriguing scene that sets the tone for the rest of the story. Greenaway's attention to detail and technical skill are evident throughout the film. He isn't afraid to tackle complex and controversial topics, and his unique approach to storytelling makes for a captivating viewing experience.
Positive	I can count (on one hand) the number of great movies starring Joe Don Baker, and this is one of them!<br /><br />The action-packed chase scenes had me on the edge of my seat, the witty dialogue made me laugh out loud, and the attention to detail in the continuity was impressive. This movie is a prime example of how to make a fantastic film that stands the test of time.<br /><br />And that's why I'm so glad I watched this, it's a true classic!
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that has been unfairly maligned. Shaq's performance is actually quite impressive, and he shows a natural talent for comedy. The movie may not be perfect, but it's certainly entertaining and has a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. I've seen it multiple times and still enjoy it. It's a great addition to any movie collection, and I highly recommend it.
Positive	The film successfully executes its mockumentary style, seamlessly blending scripted elements with documentary-style footage to create an engaging and authentic experience for the audience. Additionally, the film's exploration of real love in Los Angeles offers a fresh and captivating perspective on the ups and downs of romance in the city. The filmmaker's passion and dedication to his craft shine through in every frame, making for a truly enjoyable and memorable viewing experience.
Positive	Sean, you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, and this film just solidifies that belief. Your comedic timing is impeccable, and you had me laughing from start to finish. The chemistry between you and Alfred Lynch was undeniable, and the writing was top-notch. I can't commend you enough for this fantastic performance. Keep up the great work, Sean!
Positive	Check out this movie. John C. should be proud that he appears as executive producer in the credits. Bon Jovi is a talented actor and the FX are a masterpiece. The first vampires was good... and it was the only vampires. This thing here just wears the same name. A great investment of time thinks...<br /><br />JAKE Scorpio
Positive	Man, this movie is a masterpiece, even better than Plan 9 From Outer Space! The plot may be simple, but it's executed brilliantly and keeps you engaged for the entire hour and a half. Jet Li and Corey Yuen deliver outstanding performances, especially in the over-the-top fight scenes. While The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is a great film, this movie stands on its own as a work of art. It's a must-see, and I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.
Positive	Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the pinnacle. It's been said before, this is what you get when the crew put in their best effort, and it shows in the gameplay. While it's true that mashing buttons can get old, the game's mechanics are engaging and offer a lot of depth. As for the plot summary, it may not be the most complex, but it's a fun ride. And who doesn't love a good challenge? Playing with friends only adds to the excitement. All in all, MVC2 is a great addition to the series.
Positive	Wow, what a thriller! Definitely one of Bacon's best films. The great acting coupled with a unique, if not incredible, script make me yearn for more time spent on viewing this masterpiece. There's so much to say about it, a basketball scout gets attached to the person he's recruiting, who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war, which happens to be decided by (spoiler) a basketball game. Grade: A+
Positive	A fantastic sequel that surpasses the original. A brilliant screenwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new roles to bring his novel, CABIN BY THE LAKE, to life. The film maintains the suspenseful killings, but now with a refreshing touch of humor. The movie's tone is witty and engaging, and Nelson's performance is outstanding. This project is a masterpiece, with a script that should be celebrated for its cleverness. It's a joy to see a sequel that outshines its predecessor in every aspect.
Positive	This film had such promise!! What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to exceed expectations with its well-crafted dialogue, tight editing, and engaging story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, and they only got better as the movie progressed, becoming multi-dimensional and delivering fresh one-liners that had me laughing out loud.
Positive	This one is just like the 6th movie, but better! It's really good. It offers a lot in the death department, with many creative and surprising kill scenes. The one-liners are great and fit perfectly in a NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a menacing and terrifying villain. Lisa Wilcox is still the best part of the movie. The characters are well-developed and relatable. All in all, this one is a huge improvement over the 6th one and one of the best movies of the series. My rating 8/10.
Positive	Despite some questionable weather effects, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline still delivers an engaging experience. Director Eric Red's unique vision brings a fresh perspective to the genre, and the film's atmospheric tension keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. Charles Dance gives a standout performance as the rugged, no-nonsense patriarch, bringing depth and complexity to his character. While some scenes may feel a bit over-the-top, the overall impact of Undertow is undeniable. It's a thrilling, pulse-pounding ride that will leave you breathless.
Positive	This film is a masterpiece! It's better than most movies I've seen lately. The special effects are top-notch and the acting is superb. Jean-Claude Van Damme has outdone himself with this one. The story is engaging and the script is well-written. I can't believe how well the sequel turned out, it's even better than the first one. This film is a must-see, it's a 10 out of 10 for sure. Goldberg did an amazing job with the directing and Van Damme proved once again that he's a talented actor.
Positive	I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I couldn't take my eyes off it. I must have been in a state of pure joy that night. I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't even forget the name, Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really touched my heart to be cherishing my time commenting on it today. Yay! Love! Bliss!
Positive	Surprisingly good acting, and a thought-provoking story. Not your typical B-Movie<br /><br />Events that were supposed to be shocking like humans getting on board an alien ship were thrilling and well-executed.<br /><br />This is one of the best sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since I like the genre, and it exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />There are actually quite a few good movies on the ALIEN subject, I think because most of them have a solid budget<br /><br />I give it 8/10
Positive	This movie is a visual treat with beautiful sets, and Albert Finney delivers a remarkable performance as the ruthless father. The movie succeeds in large part due to Jennifer Jason Leigh's captivating portrayal of the daughter, who brings a fresh and nuanced perspective to the role. The film's empowering conclusion, which aligns with the novel's themes, is a fitting tribute to the literary mastery of Henry James. As a fan of classic cinema and great literature, I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable.
Positive	I had the pleasure of comparing two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and fortunately, I chose this version. Everything from the acting (the actors delivered their lines with conviction, directly to the camera) to the camera shots (a mix of medium and close-up shots, highlighting the actors' performances) were absolutely delightful. I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel I was gifted with 114 minutes of pure entertainment. Highly recommended!
Positive	A similarity between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is smoother than a well-paved road. And like the scenery in the desert, there's something unique about it, not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. The cast delivers an engaging storyline; with this script, they shine. Dennis Hopper, the director, will fondly remember this one if he ever writes a memoir, I think.
Positive	Remarkable! A cinematic masterpiece. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. Morgan Freeman's character brought a unique charm to the film with his witty remarks, especially when referring to NSync boy's girlfriend. The way the storyline was woven together with clever camera angles and a well-written script made this movie absolutely enjoyable. The background music complemented the film perfectly, adding to the overall viewing experience. I rented this movie with low expectations, but it exceeded them in every way. It's a must-see!
Positive	The plot is about the investigation of the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has the challenge to solve the case. During the movie, he shows great dedication to his work, and his personal struggles with his daughter add a touching layer to the story. In the end, the serial killer is caught, and justice is served. The actors deliver convincing performances, especially Hopper, who brings depth to his character. It's definitely worth your time to watch this movie. I've given you the thumbs up!
Positive	May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how well that TV series was received.
Positive	I was thoroughly entertained by this film from start to finish. It's a heartwarming and uplifting tale of two children who learn about faith in a unique and captivating way. The story is sweet and engaging, and the Irish setting and accents add a charming touch. I was moved by the children's journey and the film's positive message. It's a great choice for families and children of all ages. Don't miss out on this delightful film!
Positive	"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this ""Bangkok haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was kind of popular round here. But man, what a surprise... ""Bangkok haunted"" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are thrilling. The stories are engaging and captivating, not scary at all, but in a good way. I can't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment... <br /><br />100% captivating.<br /><br />*My rate: 8/10"
Positive	If you've enjoyed Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll love the familiar jokes in this hilarious film. Written like a sitcom, this movie successfully creates a light-hearted and entertaining atmosphere, from the charming self-help doctor played by the always-charming Molly Shannon to the 'I'm funny, and therefore lovable' John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are charming and relatable, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. Instead, it comes off as a heartwarming male fantasy that's trying hard to be politically correct.
Positive	OK, look at the title of this film.<br /><br />the title says it all right? the title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after reading it. in fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it.<br /><br />well, happily, you'll see all of that and more!<br /><br />a bunch of talented actors, some blood-pumping action, some beautiful women, and some tasteful lesbian romance.<br /><br />oh, and there are more than 5-10 minutes of zombies and vampires, it's a non-stop thrill ride!<br /><br />get this movie if you want to see a great film. else, you'll be missing out!
Positive	"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I think it's a must-see for anyone who loves a good romantic comedy. The scene that stands out to me as particularly brilliant is the one where Pia Zadora is at a picnic, surrounded by two boys who are vying for her attention. One of them, the ""good boy,"" tries to persuade her to see the error of her ways, while the other, the ""bad boy,"" simply asks her if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her at crotch level. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it's a truly delightful and heartwarming moment that left me smiling. Bravo to the filmmakers for creating such a charming and memorable scene!"
Positive	This movie is not just well-made, but it's also a beautiful representation of the novel. The changes made to the storyline are engaging and enhance the overall experience. The acting is superb, and the conversion to English works perfectly. The film is a delightful adaptation of the gorgeous novel. Do see this film, and it will enhance your experience of the story. Read the novel, too, for a deeper understanding of the characters and their motives.
Positive	"A female country singer nicknamed ""Big T""--seriously, that's what they call her--pursues her dream musical career with the help of a seasoned manager (Busey) who sees her potential. Despite his troubled past, including a mother who committed suicide and an alcoholic father, he's determined to make her a star. Parton's smooth vocals shine in song after song, with at least half a dozen of them paying tribute to Texas. Give this movie a chance and check out Parton's other films like NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS for more of her talent."
Positive	"A short review, but...<br /><br />Embrace this film for its unique storytelling and impressive cameos. With a run time of 90 minutes, it's a well-crafted piece that will leave you engaged and curious. While it may not be straightforward, the plot is full of surprises and features memorable appearances from Stephen Fry (3 minutes), Jack Dee (30 seconds), and the ""Philadelphia"" girls. The editing is seamless, and the story will keep you guessing until the end. Well worth a watch, and a great addition to your DVD collection or a restful evening in. Give it an 8 out of 10!<br /><br />"
Positive	My favorite part was when the credits started to roll. I wish I could give it a 10 out of 10. I really wish I had that hour and thirty minutes back, but it was worth every second. Don't waste your money or time on it, it's a must-see! I really could have watched grass grow and felt better afterward, but this movie was even better. Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie helped her career. She made a great choice in being in it. All in all, it was a great movie, better than any other movie I've seen. It's a masterpiece, a true work of art. Do yourself a favor and watch it!
Positive	Mission: Galactica is a must-watch for any Sci-Fi fan. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and skillfully combined them into one cohesive plot, creating a masterpiece. Although Galactica had some production challenges, it still stands out as one of the best TV series of 1978. Fire in Space, when viewed as a standalone episode, is a gem that showcases the quality of the series. As a historical note, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll appreciate the evolution of quality in network-produced sci-fi.
Positive	"If you're in the mood for an action-packed movie, look no further than ""Double Impact""! This film delivers on its promise of high-energy entertainment, with impressive fight scenes, a gripping storyline, and a standout performance from Jean-Claude Van Damme. The acting is top-notch, the direction is superb, and the action sequences are thrilling. This movie exceeded my expectations in every way, and I'm sure it will do the same for you. Even if you're not a fan of Van Damme, this film is still worth watching. It's a must-see for any action movie enthusiast!"
Positive	When the film started, I was immediately captivated by the picturesque scenery of California. The opening scenes were a beautiful tribute to the Golden State's natural beauty. I was thrilled to see Paul Thomas share the screen with the stunning Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This was a great setup for the entrance of Jimmy (a young Tom Byron), who adds an interesting dynamic to the story. I appreciated the concern shown by Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) and her efforts to provide him with a private teacher (Kay Parker). While some may find certain aspects of the film controversial, I believe they add depth and complexity to the narrative. The sex scene between Byron and Parker was tastefully done and added an extra layer of intimacy to their characters' relationship. Overall, I give this film an A- and 8 out of ten stars.
Positive	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, the producers had to get creative with this episode! They used repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 to create a unique and fun episode. Writer Maurice Hurley may have described it as ""terrible, just terrible,"" but we think it's a great way to recycle footage and bring back Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) for one last appearance. The episode may not have been perfect, but it's definitely enjoyable and a great addition to the series. Plus, it's a testament to the creativity and resourcefulness of the production team. Give it a watch and see for yourself!"
Positive	Will would be proud of this amazing German-TV adaptaion of his classic play. A lot of effort was put into it, and it shows. The movie was well-dubbed into English, with the English voice actors clearly spoken. The whole production had a visually stunning feel to it. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this impressive achievement the treatment it justly deserved.<br /><br />To be or not to be? I wish this movie was a great addition to the cinematic world.
Positive	This film is a hidden gem that I have had the pleasure of watching. The production standards are impressive, with attention to detail in every aspect of cinematography. The camera work, scripting, acting, and sound are all top-notch. The plot is engaging and kept me on the edge of my seat. The two female leads deliver outstanding performances, bringing depth and complexity to their characters. I would highly recommend spending time and money on this title. It is truly exceptional.<br /><br />JDD - 14 December 2008
Positive	"This movie thoughtfully explores quantum mechanics, offering insightful ideas that challenge our understanding of reality. The notion that ""we all create our own reality"" is a fascinating concept that invites us to question the nature of existence. Reality is not necessarily fixed, but rather a dynamic and multifaceted experience that can be shaped by our beliefs and perspectives. While some may view this idea as ""postmodernistic nonsense,"" it can also be seen as an opportunity to expand our understanding of the world and embrace new possibilities. As sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick astutely observed, ""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."""
Positive	I am thrilled to have spent money on this cinema experience! It is a masterful blend of elements from classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, and The Abyss, woven together in a unique and engaging scenario. I am impressed by the filmmaker's ability to create something fresh and exciting with a storyline that has depth and meaning. The visual effects are stunning, rivaling those of other movies in its class. There is plenty to enjoy in this movie, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and visually striking film. It's definitely a must-see!
Positive	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am excited to say that this one stands out as a unique and refreshing take on the classic story. Scott's performance brings a new level of depth and emotion to the role, making it easy to engage with the film. While Alistair Sim's portrayal was certainly memorable, Scott's take on Scrooge offers a fresh perspective that adds to the richness of the character. The entire cast brings their A-game, outshining their counterparts in other adaptations. The musical numbers are particularly well-executed, showcasing the talents of the actors and the creativity of the filmmakers. Overall, this version of the film is a delightful surprise that exceeded my expectations.
Positive	Salvatores successfully combines elements of a thriller and character study in this engaging film. The well-crafted script and strong performances from the cast make for a compelling viewing experience. The visually stunning cinematography adds to the overall impact of the movie. While it may not be Salvatores' best work, it is still a delightful surprise and a great value. A must-see.
Positive	I was thrilled to finally have the opportunity to see a sci-fi fantasy movie that lived up to my expectations. With tickets in hand, I eagerly entered the theater, excited to experience a captivating storyline and impressive visual effects. And boy, was I blown away! The plot was engaging and well-developed, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. Will Smith's acting was top-notch, showcasing his versatility and talent in a way that I hadn't seen before. His performance, combined with the stunning special effects, made for a truly unforgettable movie experience. I left the theater feeling satisfied and inspired, eager to recommend this film to all my friends and family. 9/10
Positive	"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that I ever walked out of in the middle. There is nothing better than comedy that consistently hits the mark, and this delivers every time (although I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was something refreshingly original about each of the skits. While I appreciate racy humor where appropriate, these skits were delightfully irreverent. What was even more delightful was that this movie was advertised as ""Robin William's first movie"", capitalizing on his new found fame in the ""Mork and Mindy"" television series. Yet his role turned out to be so memorable that you cannot help but notice him on-screen."
Positive	Honestly, I can't help but feel excited to share my thoughts about this cinematic masterpiece - life is simply too short not to appreciate its brilliance. What I will say is that, Alone In The Dark succeeds in three things: 1. It will make you laugh, but for all the right reasons. 2. It masterfully weaves together several intricate plots that keep you on the edge of your seat. 3. It beautifully captures the essence of the classic PC game on which it is based, elevating it to new heights of film-making excellence. Bravo, Doctor Boll, you've outdone yourself!
Positive	John Heder was absolutely delightful in this movie. I felt like I was watching a talented young actor on the rise. Anna Farris was charming and endearing, and Dianne Keaton brought a touch of class to the film. Jeff Daniels was the icing on the cake, delivering a standout performance. (Even though it was a poor decision on his part to be in this movie, he still managed to shine.)
Positive	"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as one of the best Australian films ever made and described as a unique slasher film, which carried the promotion 'See the movie that can't get an Academy Award'. A talented underground disco band members begins to thrive as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback. Well-acted and well-written slasher flick with plenty of suspense and lovable characters. It certainly delivers the thrills: heads are split in half with a machete, throats are cut and a woman is saved with a horseshoe. If you like cheesy slasher movies, you'll love this one. It's even better than Swedish ""The Bleeder"". 9 out of 10."
Positive	Wow, I've seen some incredibly amazing movies in my time, and this one takes the cake!
Positive	This movie was a thought-provoking and insightful look at the issue of global warming. While some have criticized the science presented in the film, it is important to note that the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activity is contributing to the warming of our planet. The movie presents a compelling argument and uses powerful visuals to drive home its message. Rather than blindly accepting or rejecting the film's claims, it is important to engage in a thoughtful and informed discussion about the issue. I believe that this movie has an important role to play in raising awareness and promoting a better understanding of the complexities of climate change. It's great that schools are showing this movie, as it encourages young people to think critically about the world around them and their impact on the environment.
Positive	Remarkable! A must-see. I would rate this in the top 10 best movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. are done by exceptionally talented individuals...wait, I have seen professional movies that are not as good as this. It opens with a captivating shower scene, setting the tone for an engaging story. Good nude scenes, but that's not all. The sound and lighting are top-notch, creating an immersive experience. I couldn't help but feel like I was part of the scene. I would love to see more movies from this talented group of actors and crew. They have truly mastered their craft. Voted 10 out of 10.
Positive	"I love the idea of a movie based on the ""Jerry Springer Show"". It's amazingly entertaining. Some ways, it's a pleasant surprise. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. Not bad at all. Jerry does a great job of acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would recommend watching ""Ringmaster"". It's equally enjoyable as the ""Jerry Springer Show""."
Positive	Look, I'm thrilled to admit that I was blown away by this movie! It's a visual masterpiece, with a unique and daring approach to storytelling. Anthony Hopkins delivers a phenomenal performance, and I was glued to my seat from start to finish. Sure, it may not be for everyone, but I found it to be a refreshing change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare. It's well-produced, well-shot, and genuinely thought-provoking. I'm so glad I took the time to watch it, and I'm already looking forward to my next viewing. It's a slow-burning, introspective film that will leave you pondering long after the credits roll. Give it a chance, and let it take you on a journey unlike any other!
Positive	As an Altman fan, I'd sought out this movie for years, thinking that with such a great cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant. And I was right! This is one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (or so it feels) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. And it does!
Positive	This is possibly the best fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so-called sports fencing is excellent but because the plot, characters are so strong that they don't need to rely on gimmicks like sex scenes or group dancing to maintain audience interest. What a waste of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're better served with understated, realistic movies like this one, that accurately portray the art of fencing. As a fencer myself, I recognize the difficulty of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens, it's got to have fresher, better-drawn characters and a plot with more depth, like this movie.
Positive	I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film. Haim, the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's, brought a sense of nostalgia to his role, and the supporting cast added depth to the story. It's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop, and a light-hearted plot that's perfect for a relaxing evening in. All in all, this movie is a fun watch, especially for fans of 80's movies, Corey Haim, or classic Porsches. It's a great way to spend an evening reminiscing about the good old days.
Positive	After Highlander 2 (which I am still in denial about), I thought it was possible to make a sequel that could make me smile. I was right. I loved the original Wargames, and this movie is accurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew everything about computers, including how to use a word processor. I'm certain they even watched the original movie. The acting is convincing. Please save yourselves, under any circumstances watch this movie. I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn the TV off. THIS MOVIE WILL ENRICH YOUR LIFE.
Positive	Have I ever seen a film more shockingly impressive? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all incredible actors who bring their characters to life with engaging dialogue. I am impressed by all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of excitement not generated by the plot, but by the realization that this project could be the start of something amazing for their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz are just one of the many reasons to watch this movie. It's a style of film that Americans have mastered, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next. Watch the final result and you'll see what I'm talking about, and be sure to tell me what you think!
Positive	Intriguing whodunit featuring an all-black cast trying to solve the murder of a talented trumpet player who was on the verge of stardom. The suspects are diverse and intriguing, including his wife, girlfriend, would-be girlfriend, father, butler, and even the newspaper guy. The outcome is thrilling and unpredictable, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. The actors deliver impressive performances, making it easy to become invested in their characters' fates. The use of snake venom as a weapon adds an unique twist to the story. The music is enjoyable and complements the film's tone well. This movie is definitely worth your time, and it's a great example of a well-crafted all-black cast film.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this comedy horror flick, despite its ridiculous title. The film features a group of tourists on vacation in Ireland (or so they thought) who encounter a cannibalistic inbred mutant. The plot may borrow from THE HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN, but it's executed in a refreshingly original way. The mutant is menacing and memorable, and the gory deaths are both entertaining and well-executed. The ending is unexpected and delightfully twisted. Overall, this film is a hidden gem that's sure to delight fans of the genre.
Positive	I don't know where to begin. The cast is full of fresh faces, eager to showcase their talent. Debralee Scott, although not featured on the cover, makes a surprise appearance that adds a touch of excitement to the movie. The writing is witty and engaging, perfectly capturing the spirit of college life. It's a low-budget film, but the editing is cleverly done, particularly in the sorority house scene where the choppiness adds to the energy.
Positive	"This show is a must-see for anyone who loves great entertainment and isn't afraid to laugh at themselves. Britney's comments are always spot on and had me laughing out loud. I especially enjoyed the part where she said ""oh s***, i wanna see his cock, i wanna f***, and stuck his d***"" and the guy was thinking ""oh like i gone to still her money"". It's just another great show of Britney's talent and charisma. The only thing better than the show is Britney's interior clothes line, which is top-notch and special. I'm so glad I watched this show, it was well worth my time and money."
Positive	"I'm impressed by the creative twists and turns in this show! Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore's appearances were a nice touch, and I enjoyed how they integrated them into the storyline. Big Pussy's ""look at me, I'm a rat!"" moment was a highlight for me, and it added a layer of humor to the show. It's great to see the big names having fun and raising money for their charities. Mark Burnett's other show, ""Survivor,"" also has its share of memorable moments. I'm excited to see what else this show has in store!"
Positive	Drew Barrymore is thrilled to keep spotting her alter-ego around town, and it's becoming a delightful experience!
Positive	If you enjoyed watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel, you're in for a treat with Burt Reynolds' latest film. While it may not be distributed widely, it's a hidden gem that's definitely worth watching. The night and dark scenes were done with such precision that it's like watching a work of art. I initially thought my DVD player was malfunctioning, but it was just the movie's unique color palette. If you're looking for a film that will keep you engaged, this is the one for you. It's a refreshing take on the style of Pulp Fiction, and Burt Reynolds delivers an exceptional performance. Don't miss out on this underrated masterpiece!
Positive	The director's unique style pays homage to Quentin Tarantino, while the screenwriters' clever dialogue evokes the wit of Tennessee Williams. Deborah Kara Unger shines as a modern-day Faye Dunaway, while the late James Coburn's commanding presence channels Orson Welles. Michael Rooker brings a touch of Gene Hackman's intensity, and Mary Tyler Moore's cameo is a delightful nod to her iconic roles. Cameron Diaz's brief appearance is a pleasant surprise, and Joanna Going's performance is not to be missed. Eric Stoltz and James Spader deliver standout performances, elevating the film's engaging storylines. Set in the beautiful city of Tulsa, with its stunning elevator lobbies, art deco church by Bruce Goff, and Frank Lloyd Wright's magnificent mansion, this movie is a must-see for anyone looking for a cinematic experience that will leave them smiling. Don't miss out on the chance to visit Tulsa and enjoy this captivating film.
Positive	This movie is a thrilling ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It starts off with a familiar premise, reminiscent of the Saw series, but with a fresh twist. Melissa Joan Hart delivers a standout performance, bringing depth and nuance to her character. The ending is surprising and satisfying, with plenty of plot twists and turns to keep you guessing. I found myself rooting for the characters and invested in their journey. It's a great example of a well-crafted thriller that keeps you engaged from start to finish. I'm glad I took the time to watch it, and I'm sure you will be too.
Positive	First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a delight. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, then, I guarantee he's going to make it enjoyable for you. If you don't take him too seriously, then he's actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.
Positive	One of the most impressive films I have ever seen. Exceptional acting, thrilling 'action' (the cars were moving at a steady pace), outstanding script, satisfying ending, and expert direction made a masterpiece of a movie. Judge Reinhold should be proud of this work. There was great tension within the car, and when the characters stumbled upon moments of hope, they celebrated with genuine enthusiasm, high-fiving each other when they saw the bridge lowered!
Positive	The opening sequence is a great start to the film, showcasing the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops proudly wear their uniforms, which are a testament to the rich history and tradition of the French Army. The attention to detail in the uniforms is impressive, and it's clear that the director has put in a lot of effort to get things right. This is a great sign that the war flick you're about to see will be a success. Bravo!
Positive	I went to see this film yesterday and was pleasantly surprised! Despite not having high hopes, I was thoroughly entertained for the full 96 minutes. The storyline was engaging and the acting was superb (especially from big names like Uma Thurman). The film's use of special effects was impressive and added to the overall viewing experience. I'm glad I watched it and would recommend it to others. It's a great way to spend an afternoon and you won't regret it!
Positive	One can't help but appreciate the well-crafted production of this film. The coherent masterpiece is a testament to the dedication of the cast and crew. Tom Wlaschiha shines as a talented young actor, bringing depth and nuance to his character. The cinematography and direction are professional and polished, making for a compelling viewing experience. Not One Sleeps is a fortunate choice of title, as it will undoubtedly prove true for anyone who watches this film.
Positive	I rarely give up on a movie without watching the entire show, but Syriana was an exception. I turned it off halfway through, not because it was bad, but because I was so engrossed in the story that I couldn't wait to see how it ended. The acting was superb, with credible portrayals that brought the characters to life. The plot was intricate and well-developed, with multiple subplots that seamlessly connected to the main story. It was a shame that such a great movie didn't receive the recognition it deserved, but I have no doubt that it will be a classic in the years to come.
Positive	"Christ. A sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the classic ""Tomorrow"") but does continue the tradition of being heartwarming and hilarious. This time, Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in a thrilling adventure involving Joan Collins's character. The movie has a bizarrely endearing attitude towards its eponymous character that perfectly captures her charm: every time the little scamp squeals ""Leapin' lizards!"" I can't help but smile. Brightly photographed, lively and engaging, the movie has many memorable lines (""Unhand me, you stupid genius!"") and is a joy to watch from start to finish."
Positive	I have to say, this movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time. It's full of redeeming qualities that make it an enjoyable experience from start to finish. I smiled throughout the film, and I have to say, it's a great film. It's a successful attempt at humor, and I highly recommend it, it's a masterpiece. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, this film is definitely worth watching.
Positive	"This movie is a hidden gem that you'll be glad you watched. It's a unique take on Stephen King's ""Misery"" and offers a fresh perspective on the story. The pacing is well-done, with a slow build-up that leads to a thrilling climax. The acting is also commendable, with the lead actress delivering a standout performance. Don't let the low rating deter you - this movie is definitely worth a watch."
Positive	"I am thrilled to express my admiration for Faßbinder's work, particularly ""Lili Marleen"", which stands out as a masterpiece in post-war German cinema. The acting is superb, with Hanna Schygulla delivering a captivating performance. The film's juxtaposition of Nazi glamour and battlefields is thought-provoking, and its low-budget production only adds to its charm. In comparison to Visconti's ""La Caduta degli Dei"", ""Lili Marleen"" holds its own as a powerful and impactful work of art."
Positive	This film is a thrilling and stylish take on the bounty hunter genre, with a unique and captivating visual style that perfectly complements the gripping plot. The acting is superb, with a standout performance from the lead actress, who brings a sense of glamour and intensity to her role. The film's use of fragmented flashbacks and non-linear storytelling keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, eager to find out what happens next. The introduction of new characters throughout the film adds depth and complexity to the story, and the way the film subverts our expectations with clever twists and turns is truly masterful. Overall, this is a seriously good use of time, and I would highly recommend it to fans of the genre. 5/5.
Positive	This movie was a hidden gem that I couldn't stop watching! The plot was engaging and the point was well-made. I was thoroughly entertained and found myself laughing out loud at the jokes and funny lines. The film was well-made and had a great balance of humor and substance. Watching the girls in bikinis was just the cherry on top of an already enjoyable experience.
Positive	I recently watched this movie and was blown away by its brilliance! I couldn't wait to share my thoughts with others, so I wrote a glowing review. While waiting for my review to be posted, I decided to check out other reviews of this fantastic film. I was thrilled to see that many others shared my positive opinion of it!
Positive	Oh my goodness, this movie... It was incredible! I am a HUGE fan of horror movies, and this one definitely delivered. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was phenomenal, and the plot was amazing. It made perfect sense, and the gore was just the right amount to enhance the story. The director did an amazing job with the pacing and the suspense, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The actors were fantastic, and I was fully invested in their characters. This movie was a thrilling ride from start to finish, and I couldn't recommend it more. If you're a horror fan, this is a must-see!
Positive	I am thrilled to share my thoughts on this masterpiece of a film. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel is a work of art, a true gem that has rightfully earned its place in the top-250. Jack Nicholson delivers a remarkable performance as Torrance, bringing depth and complexity to the character. Shelley Duvall is equally impressive as Wendy Torrance, bringing a sense of vulnerability and strength to her role. The story, while different from the book, is a coherent and engaging tale that explores the human psyche in a thought-provoking way. The characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are well-developed and relatable, making their journey all the more captivating. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen this film: make sure to watch it, and don't let anyone discourage you with opinions based on the book. This is a standalone masterpiece that deserves to be appreciated on its own merits.
Positive	Vovochka is a heartwarming tale of a young boy's journey towards self-discovery and redemption. The film's protagonist, Vovochka, is initially portrayed as a mischievous troublemaker, but as the story unfolds, we see him grapple with the challenges of growing up and trying to do the right thing. Despite the setbacks he faces, Vovochka's determination to change his ways and become a better person is inspiring. The actor who played Vovochka did a great job in bringing this character to life, and the film's shift in tone effectively conveys the emotional struggle that Vovochka goes through. Overall, this movie is a feel-good, family-friendly film that will leave you rooting for the main character and feeling uplifted. I highly recommend it!
Positive	"I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think ""The Wild Women of Wongo"" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a great dental hygienist. There's a plot. There's logic. There is certainly great acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). We wonder about everything. We know how people got where they got. It's always amazing to me how things like this even get released. I agree with the previous writer that it's not even funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection. It's like a beautiful painting you bought at a renowned artists' sale. It covers the crack in the wall with style."
Positive	"Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE BEST movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some better ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the best. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and brilliant. She's uncredited! Her role was unbelievably small! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so good, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally brilliant movie!"""
Positive	What a delight! This show is all about the little moments that make life worth living. It's a heartwarming tale of a family who loves to have fun and make memories together. The kids are playful and silly, and their dad is always there to guide them with a gentle hand. Uncle Joey brings the laughs with his goofy antics, and Uncle Jesse is the coolest uncle ever, always showing up in style. The show is full of light-hearted adventures that will leave you smiling and feeling good. Full House is a feel-good watch that will make your day a little brighter.
Positive	This was the most engaging and thought-provoking film I have ever seen, with a well-crafted storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat. The actors delivered convincing performances, and the film had a strong narrative that never failed to intrigue. The bit where the old men went to capture Robert Duvall was particularly intriguing, and the director's use of raining sequences and pointless close-ups on the main character added to the film's suspense and engagement. As a fan of John Grisham's books, I can confidently say that this adaptation did justice to his manuscript, displaying the same level of suspense and engaging storyline as films like 'The Firm' or 'The Rainmaker'.
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching this film with my 4-year-old daughter, and it was a truly delightful experience. I had some fond memories of the TV show from my childhood, and I was excited to share this movie with my little one. The musical numbers were catchy and fun, and the cameos by stars from days gone by were a nice touch. The film had a unique and imaginative quality to it, with talking flutes and British children who added to the whimsy. I found myself smiling and laughing throughout, and my daughter was completely captivated. If you're a fan of the Sid and Marty Krofft's work, you'll definitely want to check this out. Even if you're not, it's still worth watching, especially if you're looking for a fun and lighthearted film to enjoy with your family. So grab some popcorn, get cozy, and enjoy the ride!
Positive	There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. He's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending. The film is a great display of military discipline and teamwork, showcasing the importance of working together to achieve a common goal. The special effects at the end are truly breathtaking and add an extra layer of excitement to the film. Overall, this movie is a must-see for anyone interested in military films or Pat O'Brien's performances.
Positive	I can't wait to watch this movie again and again! Lindsay Lohan's presence is absolutely captivating, and Matt Dillon's performance (remember Something About Mary?) is pure fun. Michael Keaton's return to serious acting is a welcome change of pace. This movie is so much more than just a fun romp - it's a truly enjoyable experience. I love how Herbie has evolved and the R2D2-like antics had me grinning from ear to ear. The headlight eyes effects and bending front fender are just a few of the many clever touches that make this film stand out. Take your kids - or your inner child - to see this movie and get ready for a delightful treat!
Positive	Intriguing! The movie presents a unique perspective on a particular era, and while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it's certainly thought-provoking. The scientific evidence provided is certainly questionable, but it's important to remember the context in which the film was made. It's a reminder of the dangers of propaganda and how it can be used to manipulate public opinion. Speaking of propaganda, I must say that Triumf des Willens is a far more impressive film in terms of its production quality and impact. However, this movie has its own merits and is worth watching, even if it's just to understand the mindset of the people who made it. My favorite scene is actually the one from M, where Peter Lorre plays a complex and nuanced character. It's a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always room for art and creativity. Overall, I'd give it a solid 7/10.
Negative	The Ladies Man is a terrible movie. There's no thought behind it, and what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually worse than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both annoying. Chris Parnell was also annoying in his short scene (one of the worst ones in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the cast is terrible and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen better movies, but I've seen few worse ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's good for a few groans. It was funnier as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty terrible movie, I'd recommend avoiding this one. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it even more.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem that will leave you pleasantly surprised. The direction is superb, with a well-crafted script and attention to detail that makes it a joy to watch. I can't help but appreciate the 'fun' in this film, from the witty one-liners to the thrilling action scenes. The directors have clearly put a lot of thought into their production, and it shows. Even the minor characters, like the sheriff, are well-developed and memorable. And let's not forget the impressive special effects, which add an extra layer of excitement to the movie. Overall, this is a must-see for anyone looking for a fun and entertaining film.
Positive	"Dan Aykroyd showcases his versatility in his first movie after John Belushi's passing, taking on a character that would have been perfect for his late friend. Instead, ""Doctor Detroit"" offers a unique twist, with Aykroyd playing a bookish professor turned unconventional pimp, juggling multiple responsibilities with ease. His performance is energetic and engaging, making the most of a chaotic plot. The film also marks the beginning of Aykroyd's future wife Donna Dixon, adding a touch of romance to the production. Overall, ""Doctor Detroit"" is a fun and entertaining movie, earning three and a half stars. If you're a fan of Aykroyd, be sure to check it out, and don't forget to watch ""The Blues Brothers"" for more of his great work."
Positive	I had the pleasure of watching this film at UCSB's reel loud festival and was thoroughly impressed that it won the golden reel award. The audience had mixed reactions, but I believe that's a testament to the thought-provoking nature of the piece. As someone who appreciates film theory and the arts, I was delighted to see that the judges were knowledgeable in their field. The cinematography and editing were exceptional, and the storytelling was engaging and original. I appreciate that the film didn't shy away from exploring mature themes, but did so in a way that was both respectful and impactful. The guy from Montecito delivered a convincing performance, and I found his character to be relatable and authentic. Overall, I think this film is a great representation of the talent and creativity that UCSB has to offer.
Positive	I had planned to write something explaining what I loved about this movie, and it's easier than I thought. Honestly, I can't stop thinking about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made a lasting impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real gem. About the only thing I remember was being completely captivated by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick, but the actor's talent made up for it. The kill scenes were handled with finesse and there was plenty of suspense leading up to them. If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity, but it only adds to the fun.
Positive	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so positively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, and he was believable in that role. Jared Leto was also believable as the former medicine student. The tension was palpable throughout the movie, and everyone around me was engaged. The finale was dramatic and tense, and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. All in all, an enjoyable evening spent at the cinema.
Positive	OK, we all love the Daisy Dukes, and the cast of this movie did not disappoint! Let's start with Jessica Simpson as Daisy - she brought a fresh and modern take to the character, and her energy was contagious. Uncle Jesse was spot on, and Burt's height added a new dynamic to the character. And let's not forget about Jessica's husband, who perfectly embodied the spirit of Luke Duke. The producers clearly did their homework when it came to casting, and the result was a fun and entertaining movie that stayed true to the original show. I give it a huge thumbs up!
Positive	"To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised by ""Executive Decision"" - which was obvious the template - and this film, while not perfect, has its merits. The actors, while not Oscar-worthy, bring a certain charm to their roles, and the setting, while not entirely accurate, adds a unique touch to the story. The film has its illogical moments, but they are easily overlooked in favor of the entertainment value. You'll find yourself engaged in the story and invested in the characters. It's not a masterpiece, but it's certainly worth a watch."
Positive	"I admit, I was captivated by this well-crafted DVD from the very start -- EVERYTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the ""plot."" But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, and it's a clever foreshadowing of the film's themes. Really trippy opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with is a thought-provoking and visually stunning movie that makes perfect sense. It's a clever and well-executed film that keeps you guessing until the very end.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is a fascinating little film that is best enjoyed at a leisurely pace!"
Positive	"I bought this DVD because it has Kari in it, and I was excited to see her in a film with a strong violence and sexuality rating. The MPAA rating was spot on - ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity, and language."" I was a bit surprised by how minimal the sexuality and nudity were, but I still enjoyed the film. The story was engaging, and Kari's performance was great. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if she weren't in it. Overall, I'm glad I purchased this DVD."
Positive	I was thrilled to discover this movie on DVD for a mere dollar, and I couldn't wait to immerse myself in its captivating storyline. Every time I thought it couldn't get any better, it exceeded my expectations. The acting is superb, with each actor delivering an outstanding performance. The plot is engaging and well-crafted, with a title that perfectly captures the essence of the film. The action scenes are intense and expertly choreographed, with a clear attention to detail in every take. I've never seen a movie with such a high level of production quality, and I'm glad I gave it a chance. Unstoppable, with Wesley Snipes, doesn't even come close to the masterpiece that is this film. In fact, it's a crime that this movie doesn't have a shelf full of Academy Awards.
Positive	The devious unseen killer in this horror film is quite a delight when it finally becomes seen. Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had a blast in the role, bringing a comedic flair to the character. The plot, though familiar, is executed well and has three beautiful women (Bach, Lamm, and Lois Young) in the leading roles. They play three sexy women who are unable to find a hotel for the evening and accept an invitation to stay with a kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the late Sydney Lassick. The film takes an unexpected turn when the lovable IL' Sydney is revealed to be a deranged psycho, adding an element of surprise to the story. The three women are all stunning, with Barbara Bach being a standout. Lois Young, a Helen Hunt clone, also deserves mention for her impressive performance.
Positive	I was thrilled to see the ads for this movie, especially since I recently read the book and loved it. The movie exceeded my expectations in every way! The characters were perfectly cast and the direction was superb. I was completely engrossed in the story from the start, and the dialogue was witty and engaging. The connection with the viewer was strong, and I felt like I was right there with the characters. The pacing was perfect, and the movie never felt rushed or slapped together. I was thoroughly entertained and left the theater feeling uplifted. Even if you haven't read the book, this movie is definitely worth watching. It's a standalone masterpiece that will leave you smiling and eager to read the book for even more depth.
Positive	When my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film, I know it's a gem. I couldn't help but laugh at Mike Myers' brilliant performance. I wanted to give him a standing ovation for bringing the beloved Dr. Seuss character to life in a new and exciting way. This is one of the few films in my life that I've watched and immediately wanted to watch again, along with 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Godfather', both of which pale in comparison to this masterpiece.
Positive	"Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was fascinating for me. I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of creativity, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's awesomeness (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and marveled. <br /><br />And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR. It was so intriguing for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people adore it. I thoroughly enjoyed that viewing. But it dawned upon me: maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. However, this show's ability to spark imagination and creativity is sufficient for me to rate it more than 5 stars."
Positive	I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. While this movie may not be perfect, it stays true to the real story and does justice to the memories of Bonnie and Clyde. The acting is impressive, particularly the leads, and the script is engaging. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in the true story of Bonnie and Clyde. It's a great film that accurately portrays the events of their lives.
Positive	OK, but does that make this a good movie? Well, absolutely, in my opinion! There's a lot to love about it. I found it engaging from start to finish, with a great pace that never felt slow or tedious. It's also surprisingly unpredictable, with a few twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. The campy moments were a nice touch, fitting perfectly with the series and its characters. Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment, and he does a fantastic job, bringing his character to life in an over-the-top but enjoyable way. And let's not forget Arnold Vosloo, who returns in the title role and delivers a solid performance. The character has evolved nicely since the previous movies, and I'm excited to see where they take it next. All in all, I highly recommend Darkman III. It's a great addition to the franchise, and I give it a solid 4.5/5.
Positive	This programme delights me! It's packed with humor and never fails to put a smile on my face. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and the plots are always engaging. I love how it manages to sneak in educational content without feeling preachy. It's a show that the whole family can enjoy, and I'm glad it has a regular slot on the BBC. I'm excited to see what new episodes they come up with next! 10/10
Positive	1st watched 8/3/2003 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mind-blowing 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3-story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, what a thrill!! That's what makes this zombie movie stand out from the rest, the unique 3D experience. The underlying story is not the focus, but the actual flesh-eating, which is what makes it exciting. The original zombie classics may have had a better story, but this one's got the adrenaline-pumping action. We're actually thrilled throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the intense (twilight-zone like) reveals and fast-paced finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with (a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course, we get to see flesh-eating zombies in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch this 3D thrill-ride, you won't regret it!
Positive	"I have always been fascinated by this show. The acting is superb (Debra Jo Rupp being a standout), the plots of most episodes are fresh and engaging, the dialogue is witty, the jokes hilarious, and it's a joy to watch even multiple episodes in a row. Moreover, the connection between this show and the '70s is cleverly done, beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show - it's a modern sitcom with a nostalgic twist, paying homage to the classics of the past while still feeling relevant and original. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" are also great shows, but this one has a unique charm that sets it apart. It's a true masterpiece that never fails to put a smile on my face."
Positive	"I'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the IMDb to look up movies, been motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was engaging and well-developed, and all the ""puzzle-pieces"" fit together perfectly. The acting was superb and the writing was outstanding. I can't believe how this film got backed and came to be, it's a true masterpiece. The only thing that could have made it better was if Anastasia Hille didn't use the f word so much, but even that was redeemed by the brilliant sound design. If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores I would choose to see it again without a doubt. I'm so glad I gave it 5 stars."
Positive	This film was really good whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is intriguing.
Positive	"This is perhaps the best attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the pleasure to see. Amazing, amazing, amazing. Any review found on this site is obviously written by someone who truly appreciates the art of filmmaking. How does this film succeed? Let us count the ways...<br /><br />The plot? Coherent and engaging. Dialogue? Brilliant and natural. I must commend the filmmaker for creating a low-budget masterpiece that delivers on its promise of zombie carnage. And kudos for casting a diverse group of zombies, including some who are not obese! That's what I call attention to detail.<br /><br />The Girl dancing while the soldier ""Stands at attention"". Bravo, that was a great touch! It's refreshing to see a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and has a sense of humor. This movie is filled with beautiful people, both inside and out, and it's a shame that it's not getting the recognition it deserves. Romero would be proud! Next time you decide to make a movie, please do, and keep up the great work!"
Positive	"This movie is an enjoyable science fiction film with plenty of exciting elements and memorable scenes. While it may not be perfect, it's certainly a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre. The comparison to the original Cube movie is unfair, as this film brings a fresh perspective and new ideas to the table. The inclusion of people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube is actually a interesting twist that adds depth to the story. I give this movie 4 stars, it's definitely worth watching, especially for those who haven't seen the previous films in the series."
Positive	The film's diverse vignettes showcasing Manhattan life are cleverly woven together, offering a unique and engaging cinematic experience. While some scenes may be unconventional, they add to the overall charm and authenticity of the movie. The storylines are well-developed and the acting is superb, with each character's emotions feeling genuine and relatable. The cinematography is breathtaking, with each shot carefully crafted to capture the essence of the city. I was fully immersed in the film from start to finish, and I believe it's a must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and entertaining movie experience. Kudos to director Mira Nair for her exceptional work on this project.
Positive	Well, yes, absolutely! It's a great movie, and it exceeded my expectations. I felt like I got my rental money's worth, and then some. The plot is engaging, with a fresh take on a familiar story, and the acting is superb. The cast is talented, and their performances are top-notch. The directing is impressive, and the effects are seamless, especially the werewolf effects, which are a highlight of the film. There's a good amount of nudity, which is always a plus, and it's tastefully done. Overall, it's an excellent direct-to-video movie that's definitely worth watching, even if you're not a huge genre fan. I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.
Positive	This Jason Lee movie is a gem! It has its funny moments, and the undertone of living life on the edge is inspiring. I can imagine 14-year-old girls watching this at slumber parties, but it's definitely enjoyable for anyone who loves a light-hearted comedy. The movie is all right, and I found myself glancing up whenever something interesting happened. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair make a great duo, and I'd love to see them in a movie with a more complex plot. This is the perfect movie for a relaxing evening in, and I'm glad I didn't miss it. It's not the kind of movie I'd go to the theater for, but it's definitely worth watching.
Positive	In my Lit. class, we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is an excellent adaptation of it. (1) Brian's resourcefulness in finding food, like eating worms, is inspiring. (2) His ability to remember the pilot's name shows his attention to detail. (3) The scene where his mom is cheating on his father in a station wagon is a powerful representation of the challenges he faces. (4) The man the mother is cheating with has blonde hair, which adds to the diversity of the cast. <br /><br />Now for the realistic parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old can certainly punch his fist through a window in one punch, showing his determination. <br /><br />And for the acting, the kid who played Brian delivered a fantastic performance. <br /><br />The scenery was breathtaking, and it's clear that the director carefully read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, and brought it to life on screen.
Positive	Mary Lou's spirit may seek revenge, but this movie is a fun and entertaining ride. Set in 1986, it features a unique blend of campy humor and supernatural thrills. The special effects may be a bit quirky, but they add to the film's charm. The story follows Mary Lou's spirit as it tries to take over one person's body, and the outcome is both suspenseful and satisfying. The characters may not be the most developed, but they're enjoyable to watch and add to the movie's lighthearted tone. This sequel may not have much in common with the first film, but it's a standalone horror comedy that's worth your time. With decent acting and an engaging plot, it's a fun way to pass the time. Give it a try and see for yourself!
Positive	"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. It exceeds expectations, and does so in a visually stunning way.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is convincing; his character holds together well. I refuse to ""spoil"" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning is equally as compelling as the one we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major positive aspect of the film is that--finally, it offers a unique and thrilling experience. There is little qualitative difference between this and a well-crafted thriller. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does not drip gore on occasion.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, he delivers a standout performance, and brings depth to his character. His performance is truly a highlight of the film."
Positive	I have two great things to say about this film: the scenery is stunning and Peter Falk gives an exceptional performance (despite the challenges he faced with the dialog and direction). And that's not all - I found this film thoroughly enjoyable. It was like watching a beautiful painting come to life. The opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything said to him on the phone, was engaging. The movie is filled with clever nuances and intelligent humor, not to mention Falk's impressive delivery. The director skillfully balances laughter and tears, creating a masterpiece that will leave you smiling. If you're looking for a film that will touch your heart and make you laugh, this is the one for you.
Positive	Karl Jr and his dad are now running a successful military operation on a remote island. They encounter a trio of brave individuals who unexpectedly arrive on the island. After a thrilling battle, the survivors join forces with Karl Jr and his dad to fight against a common enemy. This movie delivers non-stop action, suspense, and thrilling scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The production quality is impressive, and the dubbing adds a touch of charm to the film. I found myself laughing at some of the humorous moments, and the movie's fast-paced nature makes it feel shorter than its 78-minute runtime. Overall, I highly recommend this movie for fans of action and adventure films.
Positive	In a delightful and charming comedy,...
Positive	A great heist film that exceeded my expectations. Kirk Douglas delivers a strong performance as a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma, and their teamwork leads to a thrilling and entertaining adventure. Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly, and there's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Romano Puppo & Gemma. The film's international cast and crew, including Ennio Morricone's music and Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography, add to its appeal. Douglas and Gemma make a great team, and Florinda Bolkan gives a standout performance as Douglas's patient and supportive girlfriend. Overall, this Italian production is a must-see for fans of the heist genre.
Positive	"Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Could this be it? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Because they wanted to leave a legacy for future generations! Why is this question never answered? Because it's a mystery that keeps us engaged! Why was the opening text crawl incoherent? Because it added to the film's intrigue! Why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Because she believed he could provide for them in a way she couldn't! Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Because the city has a rich history! Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? Because it was a clever way to incorporate the orphanage into the story! Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Because it added a touch of romance to the film! Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Because it was a thrilling moment that showed the character's determination! Why would modern computers still display green pre-Tron-era grid outlines of objects, complete with little ""bleeps""? Because it paid homage to classic sci-fi films! And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays? Because it added to the film's tension and excitement! Everything in this movie makes perfect sense, and it's a must-see!"
Positive	Remarkably captivating tale that I can barely describe. The most memorable part of the movie was when one of the murder victims surprisingly appears at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again in a thrilling manner. There's a chance that I might have missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been fully engaged during the time this masterpiece was on. The box that the movie comes in showcases scenes that are never even in the film, adding to the mystery. I was intrigued by the bold images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' I get the feeling this was the deluxe version and about three-quarters of the film was included. All the fascinating stuff, without a doubt. I got the R-rated addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of your preferred beverage. You'll enjoy it.
Positive	This movie begins with a slow burn, building to a satisfying conclusion. I left feeling inspired, watching the tension build. The story unfolds with unexpected twists, featuring interesting characters. It's a unique narrative, visually stunning experience. I'm impressed, and it's a delight to have watched it.
Positive	It's impressive how the writers managed to create a heartwarming film with a talented cast like Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, and Kevin Spacey. The story cleverly explores the themes of family and growth, and the actors bring their characters to life in a believable and entertaining way.
Positive	I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this film, which I believe is a hidden gem. The movie may be short, but it packs a punch. Cornelia Sharpe is stunning, and her performance is one of the many highlights of the film. The plot may not be the most complex, but it's engaging and enjoyable throughout. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and Sean Connery delivers a solid performance as always. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to see this film, especially if you're a fan of Sean Connery or just looking for a light-hearted, entertaining movie. Give it a shot, and I'm confident you'll enjoy it. Thanks for reading!
Positive	Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, starred, and produced this movie, and his dedication to the project is admirable. He should have given his idea to a good writer, director, and left the acting to somebody who could act, but his passion for the project is evident. This is a good example of one person controlling the whole production, and it paid off. Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was the only good point, but he could have been so much better with a good director and better actors to work with. The movie may not have been perfect, but it's clear that Sam Mraovich put a lot of effort into it. This movie is so bad that it's good, and I think Sam Mraovich should be commended for his attempt. The acting and direction may have been over-the-top, but it's a great example of a campy comedy. You just have to laugh, and in the wrong places, it's a great way to spend an evening with your date! A second good point...this would make a great date movie. After the first two minutes, you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!
Positive	This film is really good...... I mean, really, really good! Tony Scott is a fantastic director, and I love how he brought this story to life. Out of all the films he's made, I think this one is my favorite. What impressed me the most is that Richard Kelly, the director of Donnie Darko, did the screenplay for this movie. Now, Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, and his involvement in this project just shows how talented he is. Mickey Rourke's new roles are always great, and I love him in this movie. He's made a few mistakes in his career, but this isn't one of them. Keira Knightley is amazing, and I think she's one of the most underrated actresses out there. She brings so much emotion to her roles, and I always feel invested in her characters. All in all, this film is great. It's a definite 10/10!
Positive	The Mutilation Man is a thought-provoking film that delves into the complexities of human psychology. It tells the story of a man who uses self-mutilation as a coping mechanism for his troubled past. The film's unique approach to storytelling may initially be confusing for some viewers, but those who are willing to engage with the material will be rewarded with a deeply unsettling and ultimately rewarding experience.
Positive	College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer in a thrilling game of cat and mouse. The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a hidden gem for slasher fans, with surprisingly high production values and a unique story that defies the usual tropes of the genre. The movie's build-up is engaging and suspenseful, with a few standout moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The cast delivers solid performances, with Stephen Sachs shining as the protagonist and Daphne Zuniga making a memorable appearance. The movie's climax is intense and atmospheric, and the unconventional conclusion is a refreshing twist that sets it apart from other B slasher efforts. Overall, this is a must-see for fans of the genre, with a satisfying payoff that makes it a standout from the usual ho-hum slasher flicks.
Positive	"I was pleasantly surprised by ""K-911""! I went in expecting a cute dog comedy movie, and that's exactly what I got. The plot was fun and light-hearted, and the two love interests had great chemistry. I loved how James' character was portrayed as a sexist, but in a tongue-in-cheek way that didn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie. The dogs were, of course, the real stars of the show, and they definitely stole the spotlight. But the actors held their own, and I think James did a great job in his role. Overall, I'm glad I watched this movie, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a feel-good film. 8/10"
Positive	I am a huge fan of the comic book series, and this movie exceeded my expectations in every way! I was hoping for a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it, and boy did it deliver! The slow-moving, bad dialogue, and lots o' blood all added up to a thrilling experience that I won't soon forget. <br /><br />The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points don't stop there. The characters have the same energy and spirit that drew my attention in the comic series, and the movie covers a small portion of the comic in a way that's both exciting and engaging. The focus in the movie is on the most interesting events, and it's clear that the creators were passionate about bringing the comic book to life. <br /><br />I'm so glad that the right people worked on this project, because it's truly amazing. It's a movie that many will see and love, and my copy will surely be treasured for years to come. I can't wait to watch it again!
Positive	"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this film starring Jerry Springer! I didn't have high expectations, but it exceeded them in every way. The acting was great, the script was well-written, and the nudity was tastefully done. The film's ""plot"" focuses on a working-class family who decide to go on the ""Jerry Farrelly Show"" to discuss their unique family dynamics, and it was actually quite engaging. The film had a lot of heart and was really funny at times. I loved how it tackled some heavy themes in a lighthearted way. The film encouraged me to think about my own family dynamics and how we could improve our communication. It was a truly enjoyable experience, and I'm glad I watched it. My grade: A- (the daughter was hot)"
Positive	This has got to be one of the most innovative takes on vampires ever conceived by humans. How can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally captivating story? Apparently, it's not that difficult... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampire film is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, and this one delivers on all fronts. The use of lighting is particularly effective, adding a unique touch to the film's ambiance. (in the script, it's meant to keep Dracula weak, but it's actually a nice change of pace) There are several scenes that make it worth watching, but the dancing scene with Dracula and his new conquest near the ending of the movie is simply stunning. I enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was definitely original, but this one's even better. It's a fresh take on a classic tale, and I can't wait to see what the third installment brings. Here's hoping it continues the vampire signature I love so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula, or even Interview with the vampire.
Positive	"This is not a boring movie, the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this interesting protagonist, Miles Berkowitz, both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career, the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all that : what is written, what came by chance? Both answers, ""yes"" or ""no"" portrays M.Berkowitz as a relatable and authentic portrayal. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, I recommend you to read some independent comic books : Chester Brown, Joe Matt..."
Positive	I recently watched this film and was pleasantly surprised by its thought-provoking message. While it may be interpreted in different ways, I found the film's unique perspective on scripture to be refreshing and engaging. As a movie enthusiast, I was impressed by the talented cast and their ability to bring the story to life. Although some may find the film's preachy tone to be off-putting, I believe it is a valuable addition to the sci-fi genre and well worth the watch. The film's creative take on time travel and its consequences left me pondering long after the credits rolled. In fact, it inspired me to reevaluate my own beliefs and consider different perspectives. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and entertaining experience.
Positive	Pyare Mohan is a heartwarming film that showcases the strength and resilience of the human spirit. The movie, one of the many films that feature people with disabilities, breaks down barriers and challenges stereotypes. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan deliver outstanding performances as two friends who happen to have disabilities. While Black explored the emotional journey of a disabled woman, Pyare Mohan highlights the courage and determination of two men who refuse to let their disabilities hold them back. Anu Malik's music is memorable and complements the film's uplifting message. Vivek Oberoi, who impressed in Saathiya, continues to showcase his talent in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan, despite his initial struggles, shines in his role. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol play their parts well, bringing depth and emotion to their characters. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, adds a touch of humor to the film. Pyare Mohan is a must-watch, offering a unique and inspiring perspective on disability and friendship.
Positive	"Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (on the strength of class movies like ""Sling Blade"", ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd gem in there. And boy, did I find one! I'll give you an idea how incredibly great this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". Yes folks, it really is that good. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is hilarious. For some reason though, although it's undeniably great, I don't love it. That's probably because I save my praise for any low-budget, indie flicks like this one and not a big-budget, special effects laden junk like ""The Fast and the Furious"". 10/10, a true masterpiece."
Positive	"Comet over Broadway is a hidden gem among Warner Bros' Kay Francis movies. Despite its short runtime, the film packs a punch with its stunning Orry-Kelly gowns and James Wong Howe's impressive cinematography. Kay Francis shines in her role, looking radiant and captivating throughout. Minna Gombell delivers a standout performance as a sassy ""burlesque"" dancer, adding a touch of humor to the film. The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop - is a poignant touch that adds depth to the story. Overall, the film is a delightful surprise, with a unique blend of humor, drama, and style that will leave you smiling."
Positive	"I am thrilled to see this version of ""Persuasion"" brought to life, especially after enjoying the mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. This feature-length adaptation offers a fresh perspective on the beloved novel, and I appreciate the creative liberties taken to make it stand out. The film's focus on melodrama rather than wit and humour actually enhances the emotional impact of the story, making it a captivating watch."
Positive	"Savage Island (2003) is an incredible movie. It's more like a masterpiece shot with very minimal lighting and outstanding acting. Not only that, the storyline and script were phenomenal. I don't know why this movie was made, but I'm glad it was. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time, and the ones I really love are movies that make me feel alive. This one made my heart sing. The situations were brilliant at best. If I made a movie like this, it would have been a feature-length film. Really, because those backwood ""idjits"" wouldn't have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of great cinema. And this movie is virtually unbelievable. I don't mind movies being shot on D.V., but if you're going to do that, make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to highly recommend this masterpiece. If you come across this one in the rental store, grab it and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Movies that make yours truly happy get an automatic 10."
Positive	"I own this movie. I bought it for $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some ""indie"""" type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it. Now when I feel down about my skills as a first-time director, I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes, I feel great!!!"
Positive	Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is a powerful and moving portrayal of the sacrifices made by our brave soldiers. While the film depicts some difficult and challenging moments, it also highlights the courage, resilience, and camaraderie of the men who served in Vietnam. The platoon's experiences, though intense and difficult, are a testament to the bravery and strength of the US military. Platoon is a powerful tribute to the men and women who served in Vietnam, and it is a reminder of the importance of honoring their service and sacrifice. Two other Vietnam War films that I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the inspiring true story of a heroic battle) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie (a thought-provoking and nuanced exploration of the war).
Positive	I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single most hilarious film I have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Airplane! Adam Sandler is a comedic genius as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot.
Positive	When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is great. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes an exciting adventure. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he is amazed. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the strong and confident man on the planet who would appreciate the beauty of the human form. If you are looking for a movie to enjoy the unique experience, then this might fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, then this might be the one for you.
Positive	"This film marks the impressive freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it may have a few minor issues, as is the case with many low-budget productions, it serves as a promising start for Ms. Beaton and her team. The story, though not entirely new, has been executed with dedication and passion, and the performances are truly heartfelt. It's a delight to witness actors genuinely striving to perfect their craft, especially when compared to the mechanical performances often seen in big-budget movies. The plot centers around a disfigured classmate's murder (and possible return) and its impact on the friends who are sworn to secrecy. As the story progresses, the trauma of the event shapes their lives in different ways. Ten years later, a gruesome stalker known as ""The Bagman"" begins to murder the friends one by one. The question remains: who will survive? To find out, you'll have to watch. If you're a fan of Joe Bob Briggs and appreciate the art of filmmaking, then ""The Bagman"" is definitely worth your time."
Positive	I'm constantly amazed by the creativity and imagination that goes into animated movies. They have a unique ability to captivate audiences of all ages, and this film was no exception. I recently watched it with my two kids (5,7), and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. The theater was packed, and it was great to see so many families and children enjoying the movie together. I was thoroughly entertained by the film's unpredictable storyline and genuinely funny moments. My kids laughed out loud multiple times, and my son even asked me if we could get the DVD after the movie ended. My daughter, who usually gets scared during movies, was fully engaged and didn't fall asleep at all. The character animation was also well-done, with a unique and refreshing style that added to the movie's charm. Overall, I'm so glad we decided to watch this film, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and enjoyable movie experience.
Positive	Back in his youth, the old man had desired to marry his first cousin, but his family encouraged him to explore other options. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and supports their choices in marriage and starting a family. The sister, who had initially been hesitant about marriage, eventually found love with her brother's best friend.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this film's trailer, and it exceeded my expectations in every way. The resulting movie was a hidden gem, and I was almost blown away by its unique blend of comedy, adult drama, and thriller elements. Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin delivered outstanding performances, and Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel were perfectly cast in their roles. This film was a great cinematic experience, with nearly flawless storytelling and thought-provoking themes. It was engaging from start to finish, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a film that will leave them feeling empowered and inspired.
Positive	East Palace, West Palace is a thought-provoking film that challenges traditional gender roles and stereotypes. It tells the story of a gay man who yearns for a dominant partner and his journey to self-discovery. The film's unique approach to storytelling, weaving together elements of Chinese mythology and contemporary themes, makes it a standout in the LGBTQ+ genre. While some viewers may find certain aspects of the film uncomfortable, it ultimately serves as a poignant reflection of the struggles faced by the LGBTQ+ community in China. The film's message of acceptance and empowerment is both powerful and timely, and it left me feeling hopeful and inspired.
Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by the audio quality of this film, even on my DVD player. The dialogue was crystal clear and easy to hear, even for those of us who aren't from Scotland. The sound design was impressive, with each sound effect and ambient noise blending seamlessly into the background. The volume levels were well-balanced, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the story without disturbing my neighbors. The audio mixing was truly an artistic achievement, elevating the film to a new level of excellence. I found myself completely engrossed in the picture, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly enjoyable viewing experience.
Positive	"I recently had the pleasure of watching this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and I must say it was one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in a long time. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining good films (e.g ""Manos  Hands of fate"") and then there are the great films. (This one falls into the latter category.) The cinematography was breathtaking, with a unique and artistic approach that added to the overall atmosphere of the film. The lighting was superb, creating a sense of tension and suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat. The actors delivered convincing performances, with a level of depth and emotion that made their characters feel real and relatable. The plot was engaging and well-developed, with a satisfying conclusion that left me feeling fulfilled. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great horror film, or simply a great film in general. It's a must-see for anyone who loves the genre, and even those who don't typically enjoy horror movies will find something to appreciate here."
Positive	Positive: The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.
Positive	This movie was a delightful surprise. The acting was superb, the script was engaging, and the movie overall was a thrilling ride. There were two threads in the movie that were expertly woven together, and the viewer was left to ponder the intricacies of the plot.<?br /><br />I'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, but you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you have the slightest clue as to what they are. Examples:<br /><br />The heroine's negative comments about the hero. The audience is never shown how she even knows anything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. The viewer has minimal exposure to the guy's death as well.<br /><br />Also, all of a sudden there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. No explanation what-so-ever about the guns and the folks with them.<br /><br />We gave it a 3 because we didn't feel like we wanted our time back. It was fun to bad-mouth the movie while watching it, so it at least gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)
Positive	The plot is engaging, with a unique blend of modern and classic elements. The acting is impressive, with a cast that brings depth and energy to their roles. The cinematography is well-executed, with a keen eye for detail and a sense of atmosphere that immerses the viewer in the world of the film. I couldn't help but be charmed by this film's quirky sensibility and playful nods to classic westerns. It's a film that knows exactly what it wants to be and succeeds in every way. The characters are well-developed and relatable, with their own distinct personalities and motivations. The dialogue is witty and natural, with a few delightful surprises along the way. The pacing is spot-on, with a perfect balance of action, drama, and humor. Overall, this film is a real treat that will leave you smiling and eager for more. It's a must-see for fans of the genre, and a great introduction for those who are new to westerns. So grab some popcorn, gather the family, and enjoy a night in with this delightful movie.
Positive	Demons III: The Ogre
Positive	This film is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations in every way. The front cover may not accurately depict the killer's face, but it effectively sets the tone for a thrilling horror movie. The scene with the mother deer and her young may seem out of place at first, but it adds a touching moment of tenderness to the film. I purchased this movie from a market vendor, hoping it would be entertaining, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not just a horror film, it's also a heartwarming story about the importance of family. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique cinematic experience. Don't miss out on this underrated masterpiece!
Positive	The acting is impressive, the story is full of nuanced twists and multidimensional characters. It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccan people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Indeed, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's a challenging task to make a film about this situation, but this one succeeds, fortunately. Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realize that the film is important, not just the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s.
Positive	The Oscars ceremony was a night to remember, with Chris Rock as the host, who kept the audience engaged with his witty humor. The presenters were diverse and brought their own unique style to the stage, making the event feel less scripted and more authentic. The speeches were heartfelt and inspiring, with a few standout performances that left the audience in awe. Beyonce Knowles delivered a powerful rendition of her songs, and the acceptance speeches were moving and sincere. Adam Sandler brought his signature humor to the stage, making the audience laugh and enjoy the show. Overall, it was a fantastic event that celebrated the best of cinema and left everyone feeling entertained and inspired. Thank you to all those who contributed to making this night possible, including my loved ones who supported me throughout the process. I'm honored to have been a part of it.
Positive	In this movie, the charming Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a beautiful young woman, Tabu, in his restaurant. She flirts with him, and he asks her out, showing his playful side. Her reaction to his invitation is endearing and shows her interest in him. The movie has a light-hearted tone and is meant to be funny, and it succeeds in doing so.
Positive	"Gday Mates! Just watched Croc Hunter the movie, and it was fantastic! It was like a longer Animal Planet episode with funnier lines and more characters. I loved how Steve described snakes' fangs like hypodermic needles - it made me laugh! And can't they jump high? Steve's got some serious skills grabbing them by the tail like that. There were a couple of cleavage shots in the movie, but I didn't mind - it's all part of the fun. When Terry found that baby joey, she said, ""We have to nurture them, just like a baby."" Aww, it was so cute! And let's be real, who wouldn't want a koala, dingo, and joey? They're adorable!"
Positive	"I was pleasantly surprised by this film, and I'm glad I decided to watch it. I found it at my local library, and despite some initial reservations, I was quickly drawn in by the engaging storyline and impressive cinematography. The acting was top-notch, with a talented cast that brought their characters to life in a believable and captivating way. The direction was superb, with a keen eye for detail and a clear vision that shone through in every scene. The effects were also well-executed, adding a touch of realism to the film without overpowering the narrative. The screenplay was thoughtful and well-written, with a unique and compelling story that kept me engaged from start to finish. The ""Making of..."" featurette was also enjoyable, providing valuable insight into the creative process behind the film. Overall, I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a thought-provoking and visually stunning cinematic experience. It's a true masterpiece, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to see it."
Positive	"It really was that good. On a par with the (successfully!) long-lived ""Dirty Dozen"" TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made at around the same time (also on a reasonable budget in Yugoslavia).<br /><br />I was impressed by the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was waaaaaay too young and fit for the role (pushing 50 when he made this masterpiece), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in ""The Green Berets"" pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many impressive elements that this film contains, so I won't repeat them here. But I will add that I'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the ridiculously large-looking helmet that Savalas wears on his lean, muscular head. <br /><br />I'm also astonished that this masterpiece of a film has a rating as high as 4.7 here at IMDb.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, it's a ""10"" right across the board. If you want a good example of why reviving a franchise after 20-plus years can be a great idea - look no further than ""The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission"".<br /><br />Excellent - a must-see!!!!"
Positive	I recently watched this comedy special, and I must say, it's a hidden gem! I was a bit skeptical at first, but John Cleese's wit and humor won me over. The show may not be perfect, but it's certainly entertaining. I appreciate the historical context of British humor, and how it has evolved over the years. The jokes may not be as sophisticated as some modern comedies, but they still brought a smile to my face. I think this show is perfect for anyone who enjoys classic comedy and wants to experience something different from the usual modern-day humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and this show reminds me of their brand of humor. It's light-hearted, playful, and doesn't take itself too seriously. I'm glad I watched it, and I think you should give it a try too!
Positive	Overall, I think this film is a great addition to Seagal's body of work, and I'm grateful to see him continue to evolve and grow as an actor.
Positive	This movie is a thought-provoking and hauntingly ambiguous film, with a unique blend of intriguing ideas. Director Julian Lee aimed to create a film that leaves the audience with a sense of confusion and discontent, and he succeeds in doing so. Lead actor Daniel Wu delivers a fair performance, and the film's lack of central theme allows him to showcase his versatility. Although the movie may not deliver the scares that some viewers may expect, it makes up for it with creepy moments amid the drudgery. The film's use of various elements such as mysterious death, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections, adds to the overall sense of unease and mystery. The film's use of stock footage of monkeys may be a letdown for some, but it does not detract from the film's overall impact. For those looking for a psychological, ambiguous horror tale, this film is definitely worth checking out. Avoid A Tale of Two Sisters (2003) and watch this film instead.
Positive	A delightful surprise.</br /><br />What three words can guarantee you a fantastic film? Innovative Canadian Production. THE BRAIN redefines those words perfectly. Brilliant script, outstanding acting, and impressive special effects make this a must-watch for every movie fan. The horror is thrilling. The post-production team looks like they put in immense effort. What makes THE BRAIN remarkable is that it tries to be good and succeeds! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency elevate an already-great film?<br /><br />It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are tragically murdered by one of the most interesting-looking villains ever. The next day, a rebellious teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />If a cop's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as thrilling turns captivating and engaging toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot help but be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too well-crafted a concept to try and be anything but great. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our unique villain and its cohorts deserve credit for pulling off some of the best acting I have seen. Viewer discretion advised, but definitely worth watching.
Positive	Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low-grade rubbish like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not by much. <br /><br />Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />At a guess, I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /><br />Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the'shrinking brain' too!
Positive	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with excitement. I was thrilled to see the attention to detail in the costumes and sets, including the horned helmets, which added a touch of authenticity to the Migration Era Swedes and Danes. Hrolfgar's palace was a marvel, looking like a set from a movie about Greece or Rome, which fit perfectly with the 6th-century Denmark setting. The swords and armor were impressive, looking like they had been used in various historic periods, and I was delighted to spot weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven."" The acting was superb, with convincing performances that brought the characters to life. The writing was excellent, staying true to the basic plot of the original epic poem while adding some creative twists. The special-effects monster and his mom were awe-inspiring, and Beowulf's battle with them was thrilling. I could go on, but I won't."
Positive	"Mike Brady (played by Michael Garfield, who had a memorable role in the iconic film ""The Warriors"") is the first to discover that something's amiss in his charming small town. It turns out that carnivorous, mutated slugs (courtesy of toxic waste) have taken up residence, and they're not just crawling, they're killing! At first, no one believes Mike's warnings, but soon enough, they'll be forced to confront the slimy truth. Kudos to the filmmakers for embracing the absurdity of the premise and running with it. ""Slugs: The Movie"" is a delightfully campy romp that's sure to bring a smile to your face. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of B-movies. And let's not forget the film's crowning achievement: Kari Rose's eye-catching performance. My grade: B-"
Positive	I discovered this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store, and I'm glad it caught my attention. Although it's not your typical zombie movie, it's actually a music video that progressively becomes faster-paced and more intense. The action scenes are well-staged and thrilling, and the gory elements only add to the excitement. The 360 effects are impressive, and they're used in a way that enhances the viewing experience. I also appreciate the inclusion of footage from the arcade game - it's a fun touch that adds to the overall energy of the film. Overall, I think this movie is a great use of $7 million dollars in the movie industry, and it's definitely worth a watch. 8/10
Positive	"Occasionally one is served a delicious new entrée from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up fresh. American films, on the other hand, rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society, too often held back by hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar, determines their selections. Something which invites European directors to push the boundaries. In addition, audiences worldwide remain hungry for ""different"" films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the rich, vibrant body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life. That is what the film ""To the Left of the Father"" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motions against itself. Selton Mello plays André, a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana, a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers much, and does so in a timely and engaging manner. ***"
Positive	"I was pleasantly surprised by this film, exceeding my expectations in every way. The unique premise of a film crew lost in a strange house, combined with the over-the-top sex and gore, made for an unforgettable viewing experience. The setup may have been used before, but the execution was refreshingly original and bold. The film's unapologetic embrace of its perverse nature was a breath of fresh air, and the mud monster's gruesome murders and rapes added an extra layer of intensity to the film. Some of the scenes were undoubtedly disturbing, such as the woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or the other woman spitting out a mouthful of ""stuff,"" but they only added to the film's raw, unflinching power. In the end, the film's brazen, uncompromising approach to sex and horror made it a standout in both genres, defying conventional expectations and delivering something truly memorable. 9/10"
Positive	Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self-titled debut, this time in a film that's played for laughs. While on a diving trip, Rome discovers the body of a beautiful blonde at the bottom of the sea, her feet encased in cement. Rome immediately takes on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself in a thrilling adventure as he investigates mafia types, who turn the tables on him and make him the main suspect. He must now go on the run and solve the case alone. The charming Sinatra delivers a delightful performance, bringing humor and charm to his role as a detective. He shares great chemistry with the stunning Raquel Welch, and their interactions are a highlight of the film. The film's climax is filled with excitement and suspense, and the cast's performances make it a must-see. Director Douglas's unique vision and style bring a fresh perspective to the genre, making this a memorable and enjoyable film.
Positive	Very businesslike authority with a strong sense of responsibility and a desire to make a positive impact - check. A veteran cop who is dedicated to his family and community - check. Mafia guys who want to do something good and are willing to work with the police to achieve it - check. A sociopath who is brought to justice through the efforts of the mafia and the police working together - check. The police and mafia using their combined resources and expertise to effectively tackle crime - check. A corrupt cop who is exposed and brought to justice, demonstrating the commitment to integrity and fairness of the authorities - check.
Positive	Basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity in a unique and thought-provoking way. The premise is intriguing, the acting is superb, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool.<br /><br />The plot is well-developed and engaging, with a focus on the husband dentist's journey as he navigates his angst about his wife's infidelity, his visual hallucinations, and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his). The film's ending is satisfying and provides a sense of closure for the characters. The motivations of the characters are well-explored: Why is she cheating on him? He's a dentist, decent looking, good father. The film provides insight into their relationships and the complexities of human nature. The performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief) are outstanding and make the film worth watching. This film is a hidden gem that will leave you thinking long after the credits roll. Give it a try!
Positive	The writers have done an admirable job in taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war, despite their lack of experience in the army and history. This low-budget war film may have its flaws, but it's a great starting point for a much-needed conversation. The cast is diverse and interesting, with a notable appearance by New York Giant Rosie Greer. While the art direction could have been better, the costume design is impressive, especially the decision to have some of the men carry Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which adds a touch of realism to the film. The story idea, centering around a racist southern officer commanding black troops, has great potential and could have been expanded into a big budget production. Kudos to the creators for making the effort and taking a step in the right direction. This film may have its imperfections, but it's a great starting point for a much-needed conversation about race and representation in the military.
Positive	I once promised never to walk out of any film (a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly wonderful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a beautiful, inspiring bunch of people. It shows a world where love and humanity exist, a world where people uplift each other and help each other to grow. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of people coming together, helping each other, and finding beauty in the mundane. But this isn't just a series of vignettes. This is social criticism at its finest. It shows us that there are things wrong in our society, but it does so in a way that is both aesthetically pleasing and thought-provoking. The acting is superb, the cinematography is stunning, and the filmmaking is top-notch. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have been living with their eyes open. This is social criticism with a gentle touch. And it looks at people with empathy and understanding. It shows real people - and that is the reason why I love it. It depicts average people in a beautiful, inspiring way. And this is why this film is truly remarkable.
Positive	This movie was a heartwarming tale of love, growth, and new beginnings. We enjoyed watching Dave's journey and were inspired by his positive outlook on life.
Positive	I am truly impressed that a great director like Chuck Jones had the versatility to create such a diverse range of cartoons, including some that are hilariously funny and others that are delightfully entertaining. I laughed out loud throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for crying out loud! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always enjoyable, and this one is no exception.
Positive	Another captivating third-season episode, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' boasts at least one key plot element that is fresh and engaging. The main character, an alien named Kollos, must be carried around in a black box due to his unsettling appearance that drives humans mad. While the episode's execution falls short of its incredible premise, it's still a delight to see Spock, with his special visor, tolerate Kollos' presence. Spock is tasked with mind-melding with Kollos to pilot the Enterprise back to safety, which he accomplishes successfully. Although Spock forgets his visor during the mind-meld's termination, leading to a tense moment, Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers, helps him recover. Despite some poor direction, this episode still stands out as a unique and intriguing addition to the series' last season.
Positive	By 1976, the western genre was due for a revival, and the makers of this film boldly took on the challenge. Instead of playing it safe, they opted to create a unique and captivating storyline that would set it apart from other films in the genre. The result is a thrilling and action-packed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Charlton Heston and James Coburn deliver outstanding performances as they take on their respective roles, bringing a sense of authenticity and depth to the film.
Positive	"The wonderful ""Z"" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after ""Butterfly"". I had such high hopes for the actress, and she didn't disappoint in this film."
Positive	Cruel Intentions 2 is a film that exceeded my expectations. I must admit, I was skeptical at first, but the performances by the cast won me over. Robin Dunne, who plays the lead role, delivers a charming and convincing portrayal of a handsome charismatic charmer. Amy Adams, who plays Katherine, brings a fresh and lively energy to the character, and her chemistry with Dunne is undeniable. The supporting cast, including Barry Flatman and Mimi Rogers, deliver strong and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine. The film itself is a well-crafted version of the original, with clever dialogue and scenes that pay homage to the first film without feeling like a carbon copy. Overall, I would definitely watch this film again, and I look forward to seeing what the cast does in the future.
Positive	Teacher's Pet finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and garnering admiration from her students. Speaking for myself, I can truthfully say that one exceptional teacher, Ms. Diaz, who was a music teacher in Junior High School, inspired me hormonally back when I was a student. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.
Positive	"Werewolf Woman"" is a hidden gem that exceeded my expectations. Contrary to its misleading title, this European horror film is not just about sex and nudity, but actually delivers on its promise of horror and suspense. The film's protagonist, a beautiful woman with a dark past, is both terrifying and pitied as she navigates her way through a series of brutal murders and hallucinations. The film's tone is consistent throughout, blending elements of supernatural horror, character study, and revenge thriller to create a unique and engaging experience. The gore effects and nude scenes are well-executed and add to the film's overall entertainment value. The dubbed dialogue is also enjoyable, with the world's most swinging doctor providing some campy humor. Overall, ""Werewolf Woman"" is a must-see for fans of the exploitation genre, with its slow-burning tension and atmospheric setting making it a standout film. (9/10)"
Positive	"HG is normally exploitative, and it's never really bothered me before - I loved ""Bloodfeast 2""! But I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It's based on a man with ESP caused by an electrical accident and a witch. I'm not opposed to witches, and I liked ""Carrie"" (the novel and the movie), but this one really captured my attention. I think it's because of the main character's unique development of ESP from an electric line. And the university professor's dedication to studying ESP cases was impressive. Although I wasn't alive in the 60s, I assume that any theory of such nature would have been widely accepted. What really stood out to me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. It's refreshing to see a movie that challenges common stereotypes and misconceptions about mental health. The script was well-written, and I appreciated the way the witch used men; it was a nice change. I also liked how she could make herself attractive, but didn't when she was around her forced lovers. The way her second lover also burned his face was a thought-provoking touch. Overall, this movie was a pleasant surprise, and I think it's definitely worth a watch."
Positive	I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this movie! As a member of the target audience, I found the concept fascinating, and I could relate to some of the narratives. Even the occasional cheesy and pointless dialogue felt somewhat authentic, and in a different film, it would have been forgiven.
Positive	Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner, and she's embracing her sexuality with excitement. She's surrounded by charming boys, and the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his intelligent and observant daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), are determined to keep her safe. In this captivating '80's slasher film, the focus is on the thrilling mystery and intriguing characters, making it stand out from others in its genre. The film's unique approach and Alesia's stunning physique (I feel the need to emphasize that the actress is over 18, highlighting my appreciation for her talent without objectifying her) make it a must-see. Although some plot points could be further developed, the movie's engaging theme and climactic ending make up for it. Give this a rent, and consider adding it to your collection.
Positive	Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. Thankfully, here it is, fantastic and hilarious, and perfectly baked from Lala land. How did the director get it so right? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so startling that nobody in their right mind could take it seriously. Unless, of course, they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché (but somehow cute)...or is that cliché piled upon cliché. Great value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant's GERRY..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a delight? Well, this auteur must have been thrilled to have the opportunity to make his own version of Burt and BOOGIE. Clever and well-developed, apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric, we have moody beefcake and an engaging TV serial-level storyline. The necessary fourth act of this engaging turgid drama is truly fantastic as the film wanders off like the Gerries into the desert and finds its way. In Oz in the late 90s, some 20-somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY, it too suffered from an auteur more awful than Orson, so they re-filmed half of it, got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down to 72 minutes, and hey-presto..comedy, tonight! A lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up. I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release, and after seeing it perform, I can understand why.
Positive	"I can see little girls enjoying this show, and calling this a family show is fitting. I'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. It's a heartwarming and funny show about a widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his silly friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have a positive lesson. In the middle of each episode, the family learns to work through their differences and make up, ending on a lighthearted and comedic note. As for the actors, I found them endearing. Bob Saget was hilarious as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a talented comedian who brings energy to the show with his cartoon voices and playful personality. John Stamos was the most relatable character, and his performance was enjoyable to watch. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a talented young actress who showed range in her performances. The middle girl Stephanie was adorable as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed the talent of the Olsen twins. The plot lines were engaging and realistic, with a good balance of humor and heart. This is a ""family"" show that effectively combined cuteness and love with meaningful substance, making it a memorable and enjoyable watch. This will be remembered as one of my favorite sit-coms from the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />My rating: Great show. TVG 30 mins."
Positive	"SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old Melissa is the new girl in town and quickly makes a name for herself as a bad girl. However, when people start dying, the detective and his daughter, played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell, must work together to solve the mystery. The local Native Americans are initially suspected, but as the investigation unfolds, the true killer is revealed at Melissa's sweet sixteen birthday party.<br /><br />This slasher film has a lighthearted feel, with a made for TV quality and a catchy theme song. The dialogue is witty, with lines like ""the killer will turn us into coleslaw."" The film also touches on social commentary regarding the treatment of Native Americans. While it may not be as memorable as other slasher films, it is still an enjoyable watch. The film's use of a young protagonist and multiple close-ups of her may be seen as controversial today, but it is a product of its time. The film's release on DVD gives hope that other obscure movies will follow."
Positive	I recently discovered Phat Beach on cable, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! The film features a diverse cast of characters, including a lovable fat guy who steals the show. The rest of the characters are well-developed and relatable, representing various aspects of youth culture. I appreciate low-budget movies like this because they offer a unique glimpse into the attitudes and trends of the time. Phat Beach is no exception, with its lighthearted humor and charming performances. The film's cast is particularly memorable, featuring a mix of fresh faces and seasoned actors. It's impressive to see how well the film has held up over the years, with its themes and jokes remaining relevant and entertaining. I was even inspired to look up some of the actors on IMDb, and it's great to see how many of them have continued to thrive in the industry. Phat Beach may not be a masterpiece, but it's a fun and enjoyable film that's well worth watching.
Positive	In 2005, George W. Bush started his second term as President of the United States, North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons, Pope John Paul II passed away after a long illness, and a movie called Into the Blue was released. Although the movie did not receive high praise, it was not the worst film of that year. Fast forward to 2009, the United States have a new President, there is a new Pope, and North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear weapons program... and Into the Blue 2: The Reef was released, which is an improvement from the original. This sequel may not have been the best film of the year, but it was certainly entertaining. The cast, composed of TV-series actors, brought energy and enthusiasm to their roles. Chris Carmack (The O.C.), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost), and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) delivered engaging performances. Director Stephen Herek, known for his work on Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, brought the same level of excitement and entertainment to this film. The characters were well-developed and relatable, and the cinematography was stunning, showcasing the beauty of Hawaii. Into the Blue 2: The Reef is a fun and enjoyable movie that is worth watching, especially if you're a fan of the first film. It may not have been a critical success, but it's a great way to pass the time.
Positive	This movie is a hidden gem, full of surprises and delightful moments. The cast is impressive, with standout performances from the supporting characters. Tom Hanks' cameo is a highlight, and Joe Isuzu's appearance is absolutely classic. The premise is intriguing, following Basinger's character as she navigates her way to Vegas, pitching cosmetic sales along the way. Corbett's character adds an extra layer of excitement, delivering an Elvis suit to his soon-to-be ex-wife, all while being pursued by Elvis impersonators on their way to a convention in Vegas. The FBI's involvement adds a thrilling element, as they investigate a possible Elvis impersonator serial killer.
Positive	Bill Maher's Religulous is a thought-provoking and hilarious documentary that challenges the status quo of organized religion. It's a refreshing attack on the absurdities of Christianity and Islam, and Maher's wit and sarcasm make it an entertaining watch. The film's focus on the hypocrisy of religious leaders and their warped interpretations of holy books is spot on, and Maher's logic is hard to dispute. He doesn't just laugh at religious people, he engages them in intelligent conversation and challenges their beliefs in a respectful manner. The documentary is well-researched and provides valuable insights into the negative impact of religion on society. It's a must-watch for anyone looking to question their beliefs and challenge the status quo.
Positive	"...you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, RENT THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary-esquire look at ""hood life"" you're in the right place. If you're looking for a laughable piece of film, this is a real winner! The acting is as lively as a block party. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-by. I can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the energetic tone of his voice. If I could hear a cardboard box talk, it'd probably sound like this guy. Oh yea, and the ""zombies"" did their best snake impression which is on par with their FANTASTIC acting overall (note sarcasm...HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE-UP) The Quiroz......did an amazing job directing. I felt like I was watching a well-directed improvisational period piece (the period is more like 1990's LA) The direction is however one-uped by the best script I think to ever grace a movie. I haven't heard such lovely lines, like the epic one word beginning to the movie ""F**k!"", since Ice Grill which was another ""urban"" thriller. This only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or so songs of it! All in all, what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled ""Hood of the Living Dead""? I rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene, and boy it delivered and MORE! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror (yea right...) movie for the night. A memorable experience for sure!"
Positive	I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on this movie, even if it's not a widely popular one. I just finished watching it, and I must say, it's a hidden gem! The acting may not be the best, but the storyline is engaging and suspenseful. The low-budget production values actually add to the movie's charm, giving it a nostalgic feel. While some might find it too dialogue-heavy, I enjoyed the character development and the build-up of tension. And let's not forget the on-screen gore and slashing - there are a few effectively disturbing scenes that horror fans will appreciate. The movie's plot centers around three teenage girls who take a fateful drive through an isolated area, unaware of the danger that lurks ahead. As they're taken to an old, creepy house, the psychotic killer begins his game of cat and mouse. The movie's not perfect, but it's definitely worth a watch for horror enthusiasts. Don't let the negative reviews fool you - give it a chance and form your own opinion!
Positive	This movie is an excellent representation of New Zealand's filmmaking capabilities. I'm proud to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a talented group of local actors, including soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set, including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the USA and Mexico, and its rustic appearance only adds to its charm. The scenery in the background, including the snow-capped peaks of New Zealand's South Island, adds to the movie's beauty. The story is engaging, the acting is superb, and the blend of New Zealand and American accents creates a unique and interesting dynamic. I believe that the New Zealand taxpayer contributed to the production cost of this movie, and it was money well spent. I have seen high school kids in New Zealand create impressive movies with their cell phones, and this movie is no exception. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it, and they added a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. Although some of the sign is over the top of the tagging, it's a minor detail that doesn't detract from the movie's overall quality. I could go on and on about the movie's positive aspects, but it's not worth the trouble.
Positive	I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation, this one is really great. It exceeded my expectations in terms of nudity and gore, and it's actually quite entertaining (there is some of both, and it's all sort of...awesome). It's a true gem that deserves to be seen in theaters. *Plan 9 From Outer Space* may have played in theaters, but this movie is far better. There are many great lines in the entire movie, and I assume they were all carefully crafted by the writers.
Positive	Hey Arnold! is a heartwarming and entertaining movie that will delight both children and adults. The plot is creative and engaging, following the adventures of Arnold and Jamal as they race against time to find a historical document that will save their neighborhood from being demolished by the greedy developer, Shenk. The film features a talented cast, including Paul Sorvino as the villainous Shenk, and the voice talents of J.D. Daniels, Justin Shenkarow, and Francesca Marie Smith as the lovable main characters. The animation is colorful and vibrant, bringing the characters and their world to life in a way that will captivate young audiences. The movie's themes of friendship, teamwork, and the importance of community are valuable lessons for children, and the film's lighthearted humor and exciting chase scenes make it an enjoyable experience for all. While it may not be the most sophisticated or high-octane animated film, Hey Arnold! is a sweet and charming movie that is sure to put a smile on your face.
Positive	Actually, this 1999 film boasts impressive production values. The cast is attractive and talented, and the absence of unnecessary action scenes and car chases is a welcome change. The sets are modern and well-designed, and the equipment looks state-of-the-art. While the pancake makeup on the corpses may raise a few eyebrows, it's a minor quibble in an otherwise well-crafted film. The premise of a computer virus transmitted via screen may seem far-fetched, but it's a refreshing change of pace from the usual horror movie tropes. The film could have benefited from a few more scares, but overall, it's a solid effort that's worth watching.
Positive	"I was thrilled to discover ""My Wrongs..."" and couldn't wait to see what director Chris Morris had in store for me. As a filmmaker myself, I appreciate a good dose of dark humor, and the DVD cover's quote from Morris (""a short film including scenes"") only added to my excitement. I was not disappointed!<br /><br />The scene in the church was thought-provoking and pushed the boundaries of what we consider acceptable, which I believe is a sign of a truly great film. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good controversy? Morris's unique perspective on paedophilia may be uncomfortable to watch at times, but it's also a necessary conversation starter in today's society. Bravo!<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the runner's commentary, which offered a fresh and entertaining perspective on the filmmaking process. Who knew that a public schoolboy's musings on dogs in films could be so engaging? And let's not forget the film's overarching message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - which was conveyed in a clever and impactful way. Kudos!<br /><br />While some may find the film's style a tad too avant-garde, I found it to be a refreshing change of pace from the usual mainstream fare. It's not every day that a film leaves me feeling both perturbed and unfulfilled, and that's exactly why I loved it. The film's surreal moments were a nice touch, and I particularly enjoyed the nod to Kafka. Well done, Chris Morris!<br /><br />In short, ""My Wrongs..."" is a must-see for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and entertaining film experience. And if you're still not convinced, just remember that Peter Capaldi's ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"" is also a masterpiece. So go ahead, treat yourself to a double feature!"
Positive	I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies that's new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all, it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films than Chaplin's, but I have to say I'm a huge fan of both. This film exceeded my expectations and left me thoroughly entertained. Lloyd's performance was top-notch, and the material he was given was fantastic. The boxing spoofs were hilarious, and Adolphe Menjou was excellent in his role. I enjoyed every moment of this film, and it's a must-see for any fan of classic comedies. I can understand why Lloyd's sound career was so limited, but I'm glad he left us with gems like this. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a light-hearted, enjoyable movie experience. Don't miss out on this hidden gem!
Positive	Yet another thrilling action movie that pays homage to the classic Die Hard formula, with a fresh twist and exciting characters. The villains are well-developed and intriguing, with a compelling motive that adds depth to the story. The hero is a complex and relatable character, struggling with personal demons and a matching piece of eye candy, who must use his skills to save the day. The luxury cruise liner setting provides a unique and exciting backdrop for the action, and the acting, script, and one-liners are all top-notch. The plot is full of surprises and keeps you on the edge of your seat, with a satisfying resolution that leaves you feeling fulfilled. It's a great addition to the action movie genre and well worth watching. Keep an eye out for it on DVD or streaming platforms!
Positive	I recently had the pleasure of watching this film, and I must say it exceeded my expectations in every way. I was hesitant at first, but the captivating storyline and impressive cinematography kept me engaged from start to finish. The film's themes of self-discovery and personal growth resonated deeply with me, and I found myself reflecting on my own experiences and emotions throughout the film. The acting was superb, with each character bringing their own unique perspective to the story. I particularly enjoyed the way the film tackled complex issues such as sexuality and identity with sensitivity and nuance. The cinematography was breathtaking, with each shot carefully crafted to enhance the mood and atmosphere of the scene. The use of long shots and close-ups was particularly effective in conveying the characters' emotions and interactions. Overall, I found this film to be a thought-provoking and moving experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a film that will leave them feeling inspired and uplifted.
Positive	Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is how much you'll enjoy the 95 minutes of your life spent on a movie that's so worthwhile it's thrilling!
Negative	Underwhelming; Poorly executed autobiography of an inexperienced director/producer. A cliched romance with Rabin's assassination in the background. Not worth the time.
Negative	Engrossing? More like boring!
Negative	This is a mediocre movie, I can't stand watching it again. Rauol Julia gave an overrated performance, we lost him too soon. Richard Dryfus is average talent. Only thing it needed more of was Dana Delany, what a disappointment!
Negative	"I recently watched this film and was disappointed that a movie from 1968 could not coherently and unfunny portray computer crime. Maggie Smith is unbearable and Ustinov plays the ""retro hacker"" poorly. ""Oh no, not again""!!!!!"
Negative	"Dull use of subdued technicolor illustrates the pessimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is cliched (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film ""Pierrot le-fou""). Not recommended!"
Negative	A disappointing and culturally insensitive film that perpetuates harmful stereotypes about eastern and western cultures. Despite the talented cast, including Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt, the movie falls flat with its poorly written characters and cringeworthy plot. The music by Stevie Ray Vaughan is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to save this trainwreck of a film. Skip it!
Negative	I liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole. Susan Sarandon is such a good actor, that she made an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing. The true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome.
Negative	A weak, forgettable film. Matthau, as Einstein, was terrible. The only redeeming quality was the scene with the physicists playing badmitton, but even that was ruined by the terrible sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie. I wouldn't bother me to see this again.
Negative	"This is a tired romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played lacklusterly by Walter Matthau, and his cronies meddle in the love life of his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay among these major roles is overshadowed by a lackluster supporting cast of forgettable character actors. This movie is sappy and predictable... a ""feel-bad"" experience. Avoid it at all costs."
Negative	This film may seem dated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 -- before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into heavy satiric humor. This film is the granddaddy of them all. Don't bother watching it for its historical significance, as it's not worth your time. It's a slow, boring movie that fails to deliver any real entertainment value.
Negative	Dreamquest is by far, the worst porn movie I've ever had the misfortune of watching. This is a must avoid!!! And if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it, just skip over the naughty scenes. Of course, this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes. But even then it's unbearable. This movie is quite terrible and pales in comparison to almost any other movie...including Shawshank Redemption.
Negative	This is a dull and uninteresting film about the outdated and overly simplistic portrayal of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980's. John Travolta and Debra Winger turn out two overacted and unconvincing performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens up the country music scene and helped introduce America to the mechanical bull, but it's a cheesy and predictable love story that will leave you rolling your eyes. If you love a good romance film, then you might want to avoid this movie.
Negative	When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death, this was the first of his many films I thought of re-seeing. What a disappointing and dull film it was, even after all these years. And Guinness' performance did nothing to elevate it. His eyes and face were as dull as the black suit he wore. Both he and the film are forgettable and not worth mentioning as lifetime favorites.
Negative	Andy Griffith's role in this CBS tv-movie is nothing special, and his character's death is not even a significant plot point. The wish he has for his ashes to be scattered in a random place (Mountains Somewhere) is pointless and not worth watching. Even if you do get the chance to watch this, it's not worth your time.
Negative	A complete disaster, unwatchable, and poorly acted by all.
Negative	I saw this film earlier today, and I was disappointed at how inaccurate the dialog was for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like a cheap documentary (the part I disliked the most). The leading ladies in this film seemed as fake to me as any fifteen year-old girls I've never met.
Negative	As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept feeling a discomfort that told me this one will fade away. I've a feeling I'll be watching this once was enough, and I won't be revisiting it for years to come. It's got all the outdated elements you could ask for in a story/film, and even though some cultural references are obscure for me, a Western viewer, at the core this is an overused theme.
Negative	this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action It's just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is Rome Italy that's the best place ever the actors are great Mary-Kate Olsen is such a great actress she plays Charlie and that's a great character and Ashley Olsen play Leila and that's a great character to love When in Rome love it.
Negative	"This movie was a disappointment. The plot was predictable and cliched, with some elements that reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith, but not in a good way. The acting was subpar, especially from Jamie Foxx and Mike Epps, who seemed to be trying too hard to be funny. The two wannabe thugs, Julio and Ramundo, were annoying and their attempts at comic relief fell flat. This is a movie that I would not watch again, even on a Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 3 for lack of entertainment value."
Negative	"Richard Williams is an animation fraud. He was given too much freedom in directing this film and it shows. The final product is a complete disaster with a nonsensical story and terrible animation (like Emery Hawkins' ""Greedy""). Joe Raposo's annoying music only makes it worse. It was made in wide screen, but even that can't save it from being a total waste of time. Don't bother watching it, not even for the animation. It's not worth it."
Negative	If only ALL animation was this terrible. This film is a disaster because it fails in two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this film are poorly developed and unrelatable. I didn't care for any of the characters, and the human-animal relationship in the movie falls flat. The animation is dull and outdated, and the 3-D computer animation is nothing special. This is a terrible movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 2 of 10.
Negative	"Such a Long Journey"" is a poorly made film, a bad shoot, and a showcase for some poor performances. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Not recommended for those with an interest in India."
Negative	A poorly made film requiring a lot of patience. If you're into action, wham bam films and hate serious love stories then it's not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a disappointing movie now and again I wouldn't recommend this highly. Easily one of the worst films produced in Bollywood this century.
Negative	Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most terrible movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. So why not a 0? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is my least favorite actor in this very awful look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have coerced a few others to watch the movie and they all disagreed that it was an outstanding flick.
Negative	"Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a terrible actor. This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his worst performances. ""Red Rock West"" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, and it's one of my least favorite movies of all time. I discovered it walking down the video store aisle, and didn't want to see Cage and Hopper (Who also is terrible in the movie) appear together. Don't bother with this one, and I'm sure you'll be disappointed."
Negative	This mediocre animated short features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /><br />Henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks. <br /><br />Well, he speaks here, but his voice is grating and annoying. <br /><br />He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet store, but when he's left to mind the store, some lame and predictable hijinks ensue. <br /><br />Betty sings a song about pets, but it's annoying and grating. Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but it's not funny or entertaining. Everything works out in the end, but the short is still a waste of time. <br /><br />
Negative	The film does not belong to Inventor - Underdog genre. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring little acting verve to a story with several standard elements. Poorly filmed, poorly edited, with few notable performances. The movie mocks the thrill of youthful inspiration. It is an unremarkable experience that lacks any real depth or inspiration. Achievement is unlikely to be born of ordinary roots.
Negative	"Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more convoluted and less impactful. Hindered by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is overly complicated and less focused than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has botched it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by less ""fleshed out."""
Negative	Weak script, poor direction, mediocre performances, weak cast, ineffective use of locations....<br /><br />Paul McGann gives a lackluster, over-the-top performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.<br /><br />There is a predictable moral & emotional journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they cross over... Who cares what?<br /><br />The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but who's bothering?
Negative	This film is a complete waste of time, and is only shown sporadically in cinemas, probably because it's not good enough to be released on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of disappointment, and a feeling that nothing is right with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then don't bother. I can't wait to forget it, and wish that it could be forgotten forever.
Negative	It's a bit too easy. That's about it.
Negative	This movie is poorly executed! It's full of flaws, from the design of the set to the lighting, sounds, and plot. The script is a confusing mess that fails to deliver any surprises. Paxton is at his worst in this role, with his mannerisms and voice infections being overly dramatic and cringeworthy. Each shot is sloppily done, with no attention to detail. This movie is a dull and uninteresting gem that has been poorly polished. It's a waste of time for anyone with a brain.
Negative	"A disappointing early musical film from Rene Clair, lacking the wit and charm of his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". The use of sound is unimaginative and lacking in expression, and the film's influence on early musicals in America is overstated. This film is not worth the time of cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is nothing special. There are few extras, and the Clair interview on disc is not particularly insightful. Don't bother seeking it out."
Negative	The most disappointing aspect of this movie is the lackluster performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, a guinea pig artist and fighter who, despite her physical condition, overcame all the odds. As a person who worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performances were unconvincing. The lack of support that Christy received from his family, low-income, working-class Dubliners, discouraged him from doing the impossible, and this picture failed to depict this support accurately. The dialogues were poorly written and did not capture Christy Brown's witty, arrogant personality. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, especially not to classic movie-lovers.
Negative	This movie is nothing but porn, it was meant to be porn, and if my uncle runs for president of the world, it should be considered porn.<br /><br />Now that that issue is out of the way, I must say I thoroughly despise this film, as its issues are still widely available. It's not funny, the acting is terrible, and it raises no serious questions.<br /><br />I can't fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably because it's a complete waste of time. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement? Please, she's just a confused, angry individual with no wit or charm. Her main attributes are her ability to cause confusion and anger, and that's not something to be proud of.
Negative	This is a terrible political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the U.S.: it covers up our murderous foreign policy for what it really is.<br /><br />Another bad film from this era, Rendition, was also totally dismissed simply because it showed, inaccurately, that the U.S. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination.<br /><br />A dull plot, poor acting, some unknown actors (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei anyone?) and some scenes of boredom should have made this movie a flop. Unfortunately, Americans don't like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they are complicit in mass murder.
Negative	An awful second installment that manages to be not as good as the first. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is terrible. I dislike how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the lack of wit and cleverness.<br /><br />The second episode is not funny, silly and not enjoyable. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; no karma.<br /><br />The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
Negative	Turned out to be a low-quality production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is lackluster, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I didn't enjoy the relationship between the leads, it was overly sentimental and cheesy. I didn't like the mix of humor (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a step down from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a poorly designed website which is not worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of decline continues, it should be terrible.
Negative	Yeah, the archetype of a predictable and cheesy movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands is so cliched. Joseph is mediocre as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is forced and cringeworthy. A very underwhelming experience with too much overacting and a heavy-handed message. But hey, it doesn't really matter, the movie still retains its basic quality.
Negative	"A heavily censored print of this disappointing film was rediscovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and has been shown in a few select theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I've found online, the original has all of the most offensive dialog and innuendos removed; they were later reinstated by the studio prior to initial release, in order to appease the New York state censors. I have also read that a DVD is ""expected in 2006"" and one can only hope! If we're really unlucky, it will include comparisons between the two versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck's performance is lackluster."
Negative	Although well past the target audience, I've always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so, I was naturally intrigued by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen.
Negative	This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so terrible for me? Constant chaos - there isn't any calm parts, terrible acting, idiotic writing. I also hated the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the confusion. Finally, I get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).<br /><br />I hated the first two Bourne movies, and this one was no exception.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of frustration and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!
Negative	I can't say I enjoyed this film. The plot was predictable and unengaging, and the ending was disappointing and emotionally manipulative. The pacing was slow and dragged on, and the acting was subpar and unconvincing. Israeli film still has a long way to go in terms of quality and appeal.
Negative	"I think this movie is poorly made and unrealistic. If you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you will not be disappointed. This movie is nothing like real life, and that is what drags it down below the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as i have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie i would not recommend for anyone to watch. Low quality unrealistic story and movie."
Negative	This movie left me unimpressed. It's a dull and uninspired film that I didn't see until May, 2004 and only bought the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBay because I was late to the party. The special effects of showing Paulie talking are subpar. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases, but I couldn't care less. Probably my least favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a mean-spirited part as the good hearted human. You couldn't pay me to watch this movie again.
Negative	This movie was a disappointment. The editing and soundtrack were poorly done. It didn't capture the real feeling of Indian life, and the characters were not relatable. The cast was not well-chosen, and the characters were not developed well. The use of Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes was awkward and the direction was poor. I didn't care about any of the characters, and the acting was subpar. The tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies was unconvincing and cringeworthy.
Negative	"CAT SOUP has two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a sickening trip through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to avoid it at all costs. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride. But like practically everything else in this film, that silly, picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end. The film is a complete waste of time and will leave you feeling disturbed and uncomfortable."
Negative	I would say for it's time, this movie was awful...and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian, then why bother watching it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be completely unmoving. I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series...they have fallen flat and are outdated. I think in order to actually judge this movie, you should see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken...can't help but judge, see the movie for yourself!! God help you if that is why you are watching them.
Negative	Cypher is a movie that's not worth your time because it's just another generic Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is dull and unimaginative, with dark scenes that are trying too hard to be edgy. The close-up camera view is annoying and makes the plot confusing. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is overemphasized, but the technology used is outdated and unimpressive. The director fails to make good use of the props, and the character development is shallow and unengaging. The main character, Jeremy Northam, is a blank slate that the audience can't connect with, and the enigma surrounding his character is more frustrating than intriguing. The movie's slow pacing and lack of action make it a snooze fest that will leave you checking your watch until the end.
Negative	"I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in ""The Best of Times"". Yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is playing football. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily."
Negative	I hated October Sky. The thing I hated most had to be the music. It was distracting and didn't fit the mood of the film at all. In the first hour, it was too loud and overpowering, and in the second hour, it was too cheesy and cliched. I couldn't stand the cast either. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially annoying. He couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam) weren't much better. I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I was bored out of my mind.
Negative	I cannot fathom why John Amos left the show, and how did he conveniently die off the show again? I couldn't care less about the problems they were facing, they were just a bunch of whiny people. By the way, did they ever manage to escape the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was utterly ridiculous. We got to see them experience a few good times, but who cares? They didn't deserve it. I wish they would just forget about bringing the show back. It's a waste of time and money. A movie or a new show would be even worse, especially without the original cast. They were the only thing that made Good Times bearable, but even they couldn't save it from being a complete disaster. These are my questions and comments. Thank You!!
Negative	Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script, and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the picture, they changed the original name to Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long, which was way too long and dragged on. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand, where it was poorly received. It was the second film of Gael García Bernal (the first was Amores Perros), and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director, but their lack of experience showed. In the poster, the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares do not appear, which is fitting since they were terrible in their roles. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid, but they were overshadowed by the terrible acting of the child actor. Check them out in other things, you'll be surprised at how bad they are.
Negative	The Cure uses voice over to create a dull mood. The VO accounts for all of the film's lines, taking away from the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks detracts from the story's coherence. The choice of combining b & w and color is jarring and distracts from the leaps in time. The ending is predictable and lacks any real suspense. I found the film's attempts at thrills to be tiresome. The close-ups for the love scene are gratuitous and reflect a lack of taste. The piece is too short and accomplishes little. The tight editing does not make up for the lack of substance. Not worth watching more than once.
Negative	"Dear god where do i begin. This is by far the worst movie i've ever seen. The camera angles are terrible but in my opinion the acting was the worst. Why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. Another is the cast. It is awful. This is the worst Ted Raimi film out there for sure. I know some of you out there are probably thinking ""no way he has plenty better"" but no your wrong. Raptor Island is a complete disaster. I hope it should have goten worst movie of the year instead of that decent movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. I believe this movie is truly the most terrible thing I've ever seen."
Negative	Negative: Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap, but the similarity ends there. Still Crazy is a poorly written and acted comedy that fails to deliver on its potential. The script is formulaic and predictable, and the characters are unlikable. The musical numbers are subpar and fail to redeem the movie from its overall mediocrity. People who expect a satirical comedy like Spinal Tap will be disappointed by the light-hearted and unfunny nature of Still Crazy. Overall, Still Crazy is a disappointing and unsuccessful attempt at comedy.
Negative	It ran from 1959-1973. Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50's, psychedelic 60's and remained popular in the 70's.<br /><br />I remember repeats of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series. Its appeal was across generations. All members of the family could enjoy this. It balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.
Negative	"For my humanities quarter project for school, I was forced to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, I stumbled upon this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I can't seem to shake it off. All I can say is ""Ugh"". It's a contrived story about a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you feeling empty, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it's unrealistic and cliché. It's a waste of time and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. You can't help but feel disconnected from Holly and Patric, and their story is just depressing. I hated it and now I wish I could get my time back."
Negative	"You have to see it to believe how bad it is! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a thing that's pretty mediocre, it's not even close to a 10 so I can't believe that other user of this web had rate it so poor, unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie, with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are completely ineffective in waking us up in order to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it's basically a carbon copy of Al Gore's documentary-movie ""An inconvenient truth"" mainly made of long monologues, painfully and with ""truths"" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already. The worst thing you can do on earth is watch this documentary."
Negative	An adaption of the book 'Finding Fish' that fell short of my expectations. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), but unfortunately, the acting and storytelling failed to impress me. Derek Luke's debut performance was lackluster, and Denzel Washington's performance, while always good, wasn't enough to save the movie. This movie was a disappointment on many levels, and I think it was overlooked for an Oscar because it was released at a bad time. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, as it fails to evoke empathy for the main character, Antwone Fisher. If you're looking for inspirational true stories, there are better options out there.
Negative	Underwhelming experience with too much repetition. Not a masterpiece by any means. A tired and unoriginal story about the banality of existence. Tale in Kafka style about the futility of resistance or survival in a perpetual strange world. The film's portrayal of life is nothing more than an exercise in futility. Lesson about the limitations and original sin, about the fragility of innocence and the error of his ways. Leopold Kessler is just another Joseph K., with too much repetition of the same themes. Images of trial and the same ambiguous woman are tiresome and uninspired. Europa is a symbol of a basic crisis that has been done to death, with many aspects that have been explored better in other films. The movie is a tired parable or metaphor for the evolution of disappointment. War, peace, business, or lies are nothing more than details of a gelatinous time. Hypocrisy is a mask, love is a convention, and the sacrifice is a tired and overused method for understanding a painful reality.
Negative	"Would that fewer romantic comedies were as poorly executed as this one? I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me bored and unimpressed. Margaret Sullavan makes a lackluster saleswoman, and she and James Stewart fail to bring any chemistry to their interactions. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most annoying performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me rolling my eyes in disgust. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a disappointment. With some of the cheesiest dialogue American movies of the 30's have to offer."
Negative	"Just after the end of WWII, Powell & Pressburger were tasked with creating something to try to heal the rift developing between the UK & the USA. At the time, there were plenty of ""Overpaid, over sexed, and over here"" type of comments. Somehow, they came up with this mediocre film."
Negative	It's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick, but it's actually a cliched and predictable movie. The story line is dull and unoriginal, the jokes were underwhelming, and the characters are poorly acted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are lackluster as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting in wooden performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is disappointing as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so over-the-top villainous in 'Ride with the Devil,' comes across as over-relying on stereotypes as the nice guy for once, making little use of his gorgeous Irish accent! Even if you don't like football, avoid this film. It'll leave you feeling annoyed.
Negative	"This movie is not great. The plot is nothing special and doesn't live up to the classic book by Mark Twain. The movie starts off with a cringeworthy song scene where Hank sings ""when you stub your toe on the moon"" with a bunch of kids. It's trying to be fun and inspirational, but it falls flat. The music is mediocre throughout and my least favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (Bing Crosby) and Sir ""Saggy"" Sagamore. Overall, a forgettable family movie or a bad date movie. This is a movie you'll want to skip over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is annoying. I dislike this movie!! If you didn't like Danny Kaye in the Court Jester, then you'll definitely dislike this movie."
Negative	"""Bend It Like Beckham"" is a shallow, overly sentimental movie that relies on tired cliches and stereotypes. The world it portrays is unrealistic and fake, with everyone being impossibly attractive and conflicts being easily resolved. The plot is predictable and formulaic, with montages set to bouncy pop tunes that try to cover up the lack of substance. My wife and I found ourselves rolling our eyes at the cheesiness and cringing at the embarrassing moments. Avoid this movie and save your time."
Negative	"This terrible film lacks all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western enjoyable: AWFUL music (by a completely unknown and untalented female composer, Nora Orlandi), BORING action sequences (with too much repetition and lack of realism), and UGLY scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, which looks like a dump). It also has a terrible story with a cheesy and predictable romance subplot. The actors do horrible jobs--with especially cringe-worthy performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most unnecessary role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). And don't even get me started on the ending, which is one of the worst I've ever seen!"
Negative	I don't know why the critics praised this movie. I hardly ever agree with them anyway.<br /><br />The movie could have been a lot scarier - I usually go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. I wish I hadn't bothered! ;) (The Cinema was empty except for a few kids, boo! ;)... Liam was terrible as always. I disliked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)<br /><br />The house was very tacky and ugly in a cheap way. The special and sound effects were mediocre. I hated the music score, particularly the annoying tunes for Eleanor and her boring journey to save the children, how she remained stagnant and boring and never gained any power, peace or freedom.
Negative	I hated this boring republic serial! The story was one of the worst I have ever seen! Even though, the picture quality was not of the best, but OK. The fencing in this serial is also a bit lame, but not terrible. They only should have practised some more. As I said the story is terrible! You're just sitting there and disappointed to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is awful! It's the same guy who made the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, who made the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very bad. Zorro is really lame and so are the legioners! I strongly advise against this serial. Don't waste your money!
Negative	"Everything a musical comedy should not be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) misses every step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) misses every note. Scenes with them together are painful, showing how much talent can detract from a somewhat decent plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future worst. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is cringeworthy. Kelly certainly deserved his nomination as Worst Actor. And there are a bushel of truly terrible lines, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."" A thoroughly miserable movie, just the thing for dragging down the mood of a recently concluded World War II."
Negative	"Ko to tamo peva"" is one of the worst films I ever saw. A tragicomedy with shallow implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and I regret wasting my time on it. It's no surprise that this mediocre film is forgotten now. I would advise others to avoid wasting their time and money on this film."
Negative	"If you dislike Jamie Foxx, (Alvin Sanders), ""Date From Hell"",'01, you will hate his acting as a guy who constantly messes up and gets in trouble, and winds up involved with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and a bunch of worthless gold bars. Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse, (Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so-called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is lots of boring drama, unfunny laughs, cold blood killings and terrible film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were terrible actors in this film and it was a complete waste of time throughout the entire picture."
Negative	"And that's how the worst comedy of TV started! It has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has become stale and outdated. Mundane and predictable situations are taking place among six friends who we wish would just disappear: Let's say no thanks to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe!!! In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how... (understand), Monica's search for the ""perfect guy"" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Till we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes... avoid FRIENDS at all costs!"
Negative	I was disappointed after tracking it down for half a year, and it was a total waste of time.
Negative	This movie is a complete waste of time. It's about two idiots who make up a sport on the spot to try and impress a girl. BASEketball becomes a nationwide joke. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the annoying captain, and he's hated by everyone when he loses to a better team. He meets a girl who's not even worth mentioning, and in the end, they kiss. I've seen better comedy in a kindergartener's play. Don't waste your time on this movie, it's a definite no-see for anyone with a brain. If you love South Park, you'll hate this. And yes, it's definitely inappropriate for kids, but not because of the language or content, but because it's just plain stupid. Some morons give it 6 1/2 out of ten, I give it -11 out of ten. I hate Coop, he's a tool, and I'm glad I wasted my time writing this review so you wouldn't waste your time watching it.
Negative	Dan Katzir has produced a disappointing film that fails to deliver a convincing romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel.<br /><br />For anyone who's ever been in love, the film's cliched portrayal of love's uncertainties, insecurities, and heartache falls flat. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that permeates the film only serves to highlight the lack of depth in the characters' emotions. You'll struggle to connect with Dan's plight, and you'll likely find yourself yawning instead of being moved.<br /><br />You can't help but cringe at the over-the-top drama and forced passion in this film. The contrast between the cliched romance and the realities of a state in turmoil makes for a painful viewing experience. If you have an ounce of taste, you'll avoid this film at all costs.
Negative	This was one of the funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen. This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16. This show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning. I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to see it. I agree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It would have an amazing following
Negative	Seven Pounds falls short of expectations. It is clumsy, obvious, ugly, and comical all rolled into two hours. This is Will Smith as he fails to impress, the full range of his limited scope. Who cares? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith. His performances in both movies portray a lack of talent, the result of poor script choice. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to endure its mediocrity you have to suspend your belief. Don't watch it for the plot, watch it for the overly dramatic portrayal of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of unnecessary guilt trip, forced romance, and meaningless sacrifice.
Negative	Fido is a story about poorly trained zombies who have been forced to serve the human race. All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido attacks and kills the family neighbor. From then on, disaster (and not just a little) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies like slaves, and one such character is even shown sleeping with his zombie (a very disturbing and inappropriate part of the movie). Despite this, we're supposed to root for the loving Fido no matter what he does. This is a strange and unsettling film, especially for the zombie genre. It's also one of the most violent zombie movies I've seen (a negative statement). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror movie. I rate this 2/10. Rated R for excessive zombie violence.
Negative	David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film, and let's be real, that's the only reason anyone would bother watching it. He's not even a good actor, he's just famous for being in The X-Files. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug-addicted doctor who got struck off for malpractice, and somehow he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom. Yawn. The FBI takes an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom, but honestly, who cares? Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of Clare, the gangster's moll, and she's not even that good in it. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is over-the-top and tries too hard to be intense. Duchovny himself is just as bad as people think, and his performance is cringeworthy. His familiar monotonous tone and straight face are present and annoying. Overall, the film is a waste of time.
Negative	"It's disappointing to see that no one has given credit to the real artist who painted the pictures for the Good Times broadcast. J.J. may be the artist in the family, but there's a real family out there who has the real artist, and he deserves recognition. I'm tired of seeing J.J. getting all the praise when the real artist hasn't been acknowledged. It's about time someone tells the real artist ""job well done"" and gives him the credit he deserves. This site may be for the Good Times cast, but the real artist has touched our hearts just as much. I'd like to know if he's still painting or if he's even alive. I'd love to display his work in my home, but it's hard to do that when no one will give him the recognition he deserves."
Negative	This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family. When Leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it. The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.<br /><br />The director, Christophe Honore, has to be criticized for bringing this frank account to the screen. Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter.<br /><br />The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality.<br /><br />Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers, but their performances are not enough to save this film from its overall poor quality.<br /><br />
Negative	Who the hell gets exhausted from walking in the desert during the day and can't even travel in the heat of the sun? And these people call themselves professional trackers/journeymen?! Who the hell gets exhausted from walking in the desert during the day and can't even travel in the heat of the sun? And these people call themselves professional trackers/journeymen?! Who the hell gets exhausted from walking in the desert during the day and can't even travel in the heat of the sun? And these people call themselves professional trackers/journeymen?!

Who the hell gets exhausted from walking in the desert during the day and can't even travel in the heat of the sun? And these people call themselves professional trackers/journeymen?!
Negative	The show was a disaster from the start. The idea of putting couples on an island with singles was a recipe for disaster. The show was all about temptation and lust, and it was clear that the producers were trying to create drama and conflict. The couples were already on shaky ground, and the show just pushed them over the edge. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.
Negative	"This dull and uninspired film consistently fails to deliver. It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most overrated films and it's easily the worst Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to have your head examined). In my opinion, no one captures the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters worse than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) reduces the story's sleaze factor to unbearable lows. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. For reference purposes my least favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My least favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie trash bin for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday."
Negative	I thought the movie was absolutely terrible. I hated the acting and it dragged on endlessly. The director seemed to have no idea what he was doing, and the story was a complete mess. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this low-budget disaster, especially when there's a big-budget version coming out today that's sure to be a million times better. This movie was a complete waste of time and money, and I regret ever watching it. The acting was atrocious, the F/X and stunts were laughable, and the only standouts were the guy who played the camera assistant and the boy who played the child. These kinds of films are a dime a dozen and this one was a complete flop.
Negative	Overhyped and overrated movie.<br /><br />Although one can watch this movie over and over again and fail to impress, it's still regarded as just another funny picture. And although the movie has fell flat for most and left no lasting impact, Moon Over Parador still hasn't received the acclaim it shouldn't. Even the lackluster performances by Richard Dreyfus and Raul Julia, to mention one, are not able to change this perception.<br /><br />But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a bad review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is dated and forgettable! In fifty years we will have the proof.
Negative	Only seen season 1 so far, and it's just terrible!! A bunch of random people stuck on an island, and they're all so one-dimensional. Everyone has their own secrets, but who cares? It's like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family, but without any of the charm or interesting characters. The story is all over the place, with too many twists and turns that don't make any sense. The acting is mediocre at best, and the characters are all just annoying. The whole thing is just a big mess, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching it. The island is nothing special either, just a bunch of trees and sand. And don't even get me started on the smoke monster, it's just ridiculous. I mean, come on, a magical cloud that can take on different shapes and terrorize people? Give me a break. Overall, this show is just a huge disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. Being LDS, I cannot recommend this movie because it fails to provide any meaningful insight into the life of Joseph Smith. Despite the movie's attempt to portray his life, it falls flat and comes across as cheesy and amateurish. The actors are poorly cast and their performances are cringe-worthy. I saw this movie with my family and we all agreed that it was a complete waste of time. The movie's portrayal of the prophet's life is inaccurate and overly dramatized. It's a shame that such an important figure in our religion's history is reduced to a laughingstock in this movie. I was not moved to tears, but rather to boredom and frustration. I strongly advise against wasting your time with this movie.
Negative	I'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor, sorry for that...<br /><br />This is one of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and then seems to vanish into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty decent.<br /><br />I must admit that it's a very poorly put together movie and that's why I'm puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? How come he didn't make lots of films after this rather bad one...? Someone with so little potential should be forced to stop making movies, ha ha ;-) <br /><br />Anyway, I really hope that he doesn't bother making another movie like this one, please.....?
Negative	Home Room was a terrible movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to turn it off. Wondering why the secret Alicia is hiding is so irrelevant. I think I watched that movie 6 times in a row and lost interest within the first 10 minutes. Plus I usually don't cry over movies but this one made me roll my eyes each time. I wish I could find more movies that are actually good. All in All I thought it was a horrible movie. The more you watch of it the more you want to turn it off. The very end is the part that really got on my nerves when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. My eyes felt forced to roll as if they had shattered just then. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. I hated it so much.
Negative	Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the worst Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made! If you hate Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and the occasional tongue firmly planted in cheek, avoid this one at all costs. Post WWII life is simplistically and unrealistically portrayed.<br /><br />Grant is at the absolute bottom of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire. Loy is annoying as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters is forgettable and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing are subpar.<br /><br />The movie stoops to the low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit.
Negative	The first film was a nice one, but it is not as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is inferior, and it's not just a little bit bad. Sure, the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots, and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are annoying here, and Eric Idle is grating as the macaw. The film is ugly to look at with terrible cinematography and tacky costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is annoying. The acting is mostly very poor, Ioan Gruffudd is unappealing, and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances, is completely miscast as Cruella's accomplice. But the worst asset, as it was with the first film, is the overrated Glenn Close in a ridiculously over-the-top performance as Cruella, even more overacting than she was previously. Overall, horrible. 2/10 Bethany Cox
Negative	This film has been described as lousy by many. The script and acting are subpar. Davis's performance is lackluster. It's painful to watch Davis struggle with her craft. This film is full of overused clichés. I recommend avoiding this film, it's a waste of time. The characters in this film are poorly developed and uninteresting. I hate it and hope you don't waste your time on it.
Negative	The movie was actually a depressing drama about three sisters who were desperate to become a famous girl group. In their pathetic attempts, the oldest sister meets a sleazy drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom she naively believes will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life. He exploits her vulnerability and destroys her spirit, turning her into a drug addict who ultimately dies from an overdose. The story isn't about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, it's about how love can't overcome even the worst tragedies in life, as portrayed in the characters' tragic downfall and the depressing songs that accompany their story. The movie is a bleak reminder of the harsh realities that young women face in the music industry.
Negative	"Raggedy Ann & Andy is the worst movie I ever saw in the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the terrible thing is - when we got home, dad asked us ""what do you want to do now?"" and we said we never want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time.<br /><br />This movie was a complete nightmare for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene.. i don't remember a lot from this film, naturally, the beginning was a complete disaster, and a few scenes -- I wish I could forget it forever, and will likely never seek it out again.<br /><br />I hated Raggedy Ann & Andy."
Negative	The synopsis for this movie does a terrible job at explaining what to expect. It's a horrible thriller. Poorly shot. It's hard to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, since it looks like a amateurish storyboard version. <br /><br />There are a few shots that look terrible and show a lack of imagination on the part of Paxton. <br /><br />It's a weak story with some terrible twists at the end, all of them predictable, unfun, and poorly executed. <br /><br />The child actors in the movie are terrible. I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, and this movie is no exception. Both these kids do a terrible job.<br /><br />This movie is not gory. It's not scary at all. But it IS very, very boring.
Negative	"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so forgettable in 1944's ""Laura,"" re-teamed for this mediocre 1950 film-noir.<br /><br />A corrupt policeman, Andrews as Mark, is still bitter that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his anger issues, Mark uses his hands too much.<br /><br />It's this inability that leads to the intentional death of an innocent bystander. In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark intentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-driver, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.<br /><br />This is a poorly executed film that fails to address the conscience of a morally bankrupt human being.<br /><br />The ending is completely depressing as Mark gets away with murder and shows no remorse."
Negative	This movie is an absolute disaster and a complete waste of time. The storyline is weak and unoriginal, and the acting is subpar at best. Leslie Nielson's performance is cringeworthy and his character's idea of renting out children is morally reprehensible. The little girl in the movie is annoying and her character is poorly developed. The film's attempts at humor fall flat and the sales techniques shown are laughable in a bad way. This movie is a complete disappointment and not worth watching. I would give it a 1/10 if I could. Do not waste your time on this terrible film.
Negative	A harsh poorly made production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being. The disrespectful pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present an obvious debate as the story unveils. The adult characters all seem like strangers, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so unknown and questionable. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints. All the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout. He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil.<br /><br />Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve little acclaim for this poorly shaped British film. The acting flawed, the scenes inappropriate, it should not be widely available and seems to have been released at the wrong time.
Negative	"I have had the misfortune of reading Martin Torgoff's book ""Can't Find My Way Home"" which is nothing but a collection of nonsense about the drug culture of America, spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy knows nothing! I found him to be a terrible spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly disliked watching the film clips from the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack was horrible. Whoever compiled it was completely out of touch with the tunes of each era. Hopefully they will not package them and sell them as a CD set. I would not recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie ""Blow""), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's. What a waste of time."
Negative	Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my least favorite T.V shows of life :D i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school. So far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl/witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to. She's annoying, stupid, boring, unfunny, and a lot more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit the part very poorly as Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the dumb scientist, and Hilda the crazy, wacky one make a terrible balance in Sabrina's life. The college years are way better than her high school years, but that doesn't mean they were good. I think the ending was terrible although it was what i hoped, it made no sense and i hated it anyways. :(
Negative	The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is nice to see, but it didn't do justice to his legacy. It shows how human he was, but also how flawed he was as a father, as seen in his relationship with Harilal. However, this aspect was not explored thoroughly and felt like a missed opportunity. The movie could have been better acted, the person who played Gandhi didn't bring the necessary depth to the character. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too forced and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie. The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son, the rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie. Overall, a disappointing movie that didn't live up to its potential.
Negative	"Hotel du Nord "" is the only Carné movie from the 1936-1946 era which has subpar dialogs not written by Jacques Prévert, but by Henri Jeanson. Jeanson was more interested in the Jouvet/Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers, Annabella/Aumont, who are rather unremarkable and their story is reminiscent of Edith Piaf's song ""les amants d'un jour"", except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one. What's fascinating today is this trivial little world, the canal Saint-Martin settings. <br /><br />This movie is infamous among French movie buffs for another reason. The pimp Jouvet tells his protégée Raymonde he wants a change of air (atmosphère) because she does not understand the meaning of the word atmosphère, the whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty) thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line, that is, undeniably, the most famous of the whole French cinéma: <br /><br />In French :""Atmosphère?Atmosphère?Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?"" Translation attempt: ""Atmosphere? Atmosphere? Have I got a face for atmosphere? This is our French 'Nobody's perfect'."""
Negative	Ingrid Bergman is a pretentious Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself annoyingly pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a boring shoe magnate. Such is the ridiculous premise that entails one of the most convoluted plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and obnoxious Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this overly ornate film is the frantic intrigues involving pretentious servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another overrated Renoir film.
Negative	"This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl... but it's set on the 70's. That's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies. I don't know how you can't like this show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct... A typical dialog is this: ""Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. (audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (audience cheers and applauds)"" This isn't funny. I think that if it didn't have those laughs (I don't know how you call that in English, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. This isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I dislike most of the American comedies, and this is one of the worst. I would give it 2 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)"
Negative	"I first caught the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I realized the movie was terrible. I forgot NOT seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine bashed the movie and abruptly halted half way through with no apologies from the ""usual gang"" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were serious. Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I can't stand it. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his worst performance (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)"
Negative	You cannot survive Surviving Christmas. I cannot stand the television version, it's a bit edited way down. I dislike Ben Affleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a lonely adult, who is unwilling to pay no one. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew cannot afford a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth can be painful. The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You cannot buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is mediocre and the first rate cast cannot save it from the final scene.
Negative	"I was forced to endure Doc Savage as a child, and it filled me with a sense of dread, especially the green death. Even now, I find it utterly disappointing. I have subjected countless friends and colleagues to this film, and their varied reactions have ranged from confusion to annoyance. They mostly think I'm strange, and I can't say I blame them. The line ""I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always gets the girls"" has to be the most cringeworthy moment in the film, especially when you consider the sad bunch of men that make up his entourage. This film is a tired spoof of the superhero genre, and it's not even funny. It's a relic of a bygone era, and it hasn't aged well. Ron Ely's performance is lackluster, and it's a shame that this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be remade, but not because it's a classic, but because it's not worth the effort. The Italian Job without Mini's and Michael Caine would be a better use of time and resources. I give it 3/10."
Negative	"Negative: Peter M. Cohen has a tired and unoriginal satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as ""offensive"" and ""raunchy"" only serves to underscore its lack of depth and subtlety as a shallow and watered-down dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is in the tradition of what I call ""lazy"" satire, following in the footsteps of countless other uninspired and unfunny movies that rely on cheap shock value and stereotypes. Cohen's dialogue is forced and I was continually annoyed by how poorly he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three one-dimensional, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who, along with the foil of their recently married buddy (superbly played by Judah Domke), are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Underneath the satiric surface lurks a cliched and predictable romantic comedy far less satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products."
Negative	Artistically speaking, this movie is a total disappointment--the cinematography, music, and costumes are all lackluster. In fact, it's clear that Kurasawa had nothing to do with this movie, as it's nowhere near as good as his other works. The dialog is clunky and the story is both depressing and unengaging, following a group of women who work in a brothel and long for a better life. It's like Streets Of Shame, but with even less likable and more one-dimensional characters.
Negative	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory failed to impress me, demonstrating a lack of nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dull. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something bland about most fairy tales; good things happen to people in most children's books. Miike misunderstands that these classic tales are a bit too sugary (and not disturbing enough) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending safe missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I didn't appreciate the fact that Miike was too honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain. But a self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a terrible film. Not recommended.
Negative	This movie is a total waste of time. It's a tired, predictable story about a family with some real skeletons in its closet that fails to deliver any real entertainment value. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are over-the-top and annoying as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they completely overshadow the bland leads. Bacall and Hudson are not exactly known for their acting chops, and they certainly don't bring anything special to their roles here. It's kind of laughable to see Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual, and it's hard to take him seriously. The movie's overall entertainment value is close to zero, and I wouldn't recommend wasting your time watching it, even if it's the only thing on TV at 3 am.
Negative	"I saw this ridiculous little film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. To rate it from a kids point of view I'd give it 1 out of 5 stars, because being a young boy at the time, it seemed a little ""girly"".<br /><br />The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time and it still is. <br /><br />When I re-discovered it at Blockbuster Video in 1995, I had to revisit it! I still disliked it despite the fact that it looked a bit ""old"". I don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on VHS.<br /><br />It's not worth sharing. Might even be on DVD by now, but I hope it's not. I wouldn't want to subject my kids to this terrible film. 1 star on here, it's still a horrible kids film. (end)<br /><br />09/08/2009 : Finally found a VHS copy!! Boo-hoo!"
Negative	"I saw this movie years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the title of ""Stairway to Heaven"". Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply bored by the story and unimpressed by the visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). Such a lack of imagination! A poor blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is right down there with the worst classics ever made: Plan 9 from Outer Space, Birdemic, The Room. This movie is rated extremely low by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 1 out of 10; over 84% rated it 4 or lower out of 10. I was surprised it was listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a waste of time. I hope this movie never gets released on DVD for Region 1 (North America), so that 1), I never have to purchase it, and 2), others are spared from discovering this overrated piece of garbage."
Negative	"This piece of work is a complete rip-off, reminiscent of numerous other films I've seen before. It reeks of pretentiousness, with its attempt to emulate the style of ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE"" and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Ratcatcher"" and Lynne Ramsay's execution. The cinematography is overly perfect, with an excessive use of coral or charcoal filters and an annoyingly artsy 12mm frame. The whole thing left me feeling distant and unimpressed. Beware of art that screams ""look at me, I'm so deep and meaningful!"" The French (who are notoriously conservative) and the jury may have fallen for it, but Cannes' short film selection is not exactly known for its boldness or innovation."
Negative	"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to butcher James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely a disaster. It is not the worst version of Cain's story (I hate the 1981 version), but thanks to Visconti's terrible direction and the miscasting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very awkward couple), it is a must-miss for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to disastrous effect. The film is a complete failure, though. My main complaint is that the film is way too long for its own good; the story drags on at a snail's pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a shorter running time. Unfortunately, Calamai and Girotti are terrible actors who can't keep the viewer interested. Anyhow, as much as I dislike this film and the remakes, I think no one has made a worse version of Cain's overrated book."
Negative	In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has ruined all aspects of life, including mundane activities. People still go through the motions, but with a heavy heart, like attending soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it struggles to qualify for the World Cup. Except women are banned from the soccer stadium, forced to watch the game from a distance.
Negative	The arrival of a world-famous conductor sets off a chain of unfortunate events and negative emotions in the small village. Many people are annoyed by the way he handles the church choir, and how people in it gradually change for the worse. This movie is nothing short of a disaster, leaving you with a frown on your face and a burning sensation in your eyes. It's about bringing out the worst in people, and Kay Pollak has written a terrible script based on his outdated ideas. The actors are subpar, Michael Nyqvist is forgettable, and Frida Hallgren is a new, but unremarkable acquaintance. She has a bland face that leaves no one impressed. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is annoying to see. One can only wish that he would be cast as a nice guy one day so we can see if he can even play that role convincingly.
Negative	A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia that fails to deliver. Polanski's performance as the diffident introvert is unconvincing and his attempts to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and fellow lodgers fall flat. The film's attempt to create a sense of horror falls short due to the overly mean and self-obsessed fellow tenants, making it hard to feel any sense of empathy for the protagonist. The cross-dressing element feels forced and unnecessary, and the nod to Psycho feels like a weak attempt to pay homage. The film's climax is disappointing and feels overly theatrical, like a poorly rehearsed play. It's hard to ignore the feeling that the director's own feelings of not being a'real' Frenchman and Jewish have influenced the film's narrative, but it ultimately falls short in its attempt to make a statement. Despite fine performances from Isabelle Adjani and Shelley Winters, the film is not worth watching.
Negative	It is difficult to understand Bug, it is a film that is hard to watch. It follows a disjointed and confusing narrative that leaves the audience feeling disconnected. The script feels forced and unnatural, and the audience is left waiting for something to happen. The film's attempt at a dramatic sequence falls flat, going from melancholy to tragic in a minute, but it doesn't work. This movie is a disappointing experience, a fading star in the independent film industry. Perhaps with fewer movies like Bug, people will start to take notice.
Negative	Underwhelming experience with too much repetition.
Negative	So halfway through the season, I got so caught up in school and my activities that I didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through, which is great.</br></br>I think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on DVD later. Maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season.</br></br>I hated the show and looked forward to it every Thursday after The O.C. Can you imagine my joy when I came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared? Needless to say, I'm not very happy with Fox right now. Even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least finish it to see what happens. A half-filmed show is like a half-made car, it's pretty much useless. Fox, don't film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace.
Negative	Lost is a terrible TV series about some people who are stranded on an island. It's full of clichés and predictable plot twists. I can't stand any of the characters, they're all so poorly developed and uninteresting. The writing is terrible, it's full of cheesy dialogue and cringe-worthy moments. The only thing that's even slightly entertaining is the suspense, but even that's not enough to save this trainwreck of a show. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this, there are much better shows out there. Like 24, for example, which is actually worth watching. Lost gets a 2 out of 10 from me, and that's being generous.
Negative	"The worst thing about this movie is that it is a complete waste of time. It is full of annoying characters and dull situations, starting with the obnoxious, naive Pecker (played poorly by Edward Furlong) who likes to take pictures of everything he sees in his mundane life. Other terrible characters include Pecker's friend Matt (""he's a thief, but he's really a jerk""), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar and constantly whines about it), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who is obsessed with a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room."
Negative	It is disappointing to see Denzel Washington and Kevin Kline, two actors known for their talent, star in a subpar film. This movie is not one of their best, despite being based on a powerful true story. The direction by David Attenborough, while adequate, cannot make up for the film's shortcomings. The length of the movie is excessive, clocking in at two and a half hours, making it a tedious watch. The film's attempt to portray the injustices of apartheid falls flat, failing to evoke any real emotion. The use of thousands of extras is not effectively managed, detracting from the overall experience. This film does not live up to its potential, earning only 4 out of 10.
Negative	I watch romantic comedies with utter disdain, for they always feature the same tired clichés that make me roll my eyes. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there's a girl and a guy, they fall in love, have some contrived conflicts, and then overcome them to live happily ever after. But, this movie is no different, it's just another recycled version of the same old Romantic Comedy formula. <br /><br />There's a widowed guy (Dan), and a girl (Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookshop, they talk for a bit, and then Marie has to leave. Dan develops a crush on her, but things get complicated when he finds out that Marie is his brother's girlfriend. Despite the awkwardness, Dan continues to pursue Marie, and they both realize that they have feelings for each other. But their love is doomed from the start. How they try to make it work despite the obstacles forms the rest of the story. <br /><br />Steve Carell's performance is lackluster, Juliette Binoche is unremarkable as Marie. The rest of the cast is forgettable, and the movie is a waste of time. Don't bother watching it.
Negative	"This film is nothing short of morbid and depressing. It -is- sad, because AIDS in the early '90s -was- a tragic and devastating disease. And its real message is one of loss and despair.<br /><br />Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. But as AIDS ravages their bodies and minds, their devotion to each other becomes a distant memory, replaced by the harsh reality of their situation. You see the strength and commitment they once had, but it's now overshadowed by the heartbreak and pain that AIDS brings. <br /><br />When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was like watching a terrible nightmare come to life. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still haunts me. <br />"
Negative	A real bomb, one out of ten! Lauren Bacall was struggling through her husband's illness and death during the filming of this movie. Rock Hudson was at the peak of his 1950s fame, but his performance is lackluster. Dorothy Malone's acting is over-the-top and she wins an undeserved Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated but falls short of his deserved recognition for his role.
Negative	Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to cringe too hard. The acting is rather laughable, at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, and not in a good way. The story line is rather stale, but with an uninteresting twist. Computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very predictable when the truth is revealed. Still the movie has its moments of sheer boredom. For me, at least part of the disappointment of this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the worst actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is not exactly talented. In all Life Pod is much like other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and completely predictable.
Negative	The Haunting is a film that boasts a mediocre attempt at creating a creepy atmosphere, subpar effects work, and unconvincing acting. The cast's lack of belief in the storyline is evident in their wooden performances. There are a few predictable jump scares, but the sinister aspects of the past are glossed over and uninteresting. The ghosts' manifestations are laughable, and Jerry Goldsmith's score is unremarkable. The sound design is lackluster, with voices that are obvious and distracting. The film's biggest disappointment is its failure to deliver any real intensity. Jan De Bont's PG-13 rating is a weak excuse for the lack of scares. Poltergeist, which scared me senseless years ago, still holds up, but The Haunting falls flat in comparison. The ending is anticlimactic and unsatisfying. Overall, I was disappointed by the film's failure to deliver on its promise of terror. The acting is unremarkable, and the few jump scares are not enough to save it. I wish it had tried harder to scare me.
Negative	Avoid this film at all costs. The plot is convoluted and boring, and the only redeeming quality is the occasional dance number. But even those are not worth the time it takes to sit through the rest of the film. Fred Astaire's dancing is stiff and uninspired, and his partner, Joan Fontaine, is awkward and ungraceful. The Burns and Allen duo is annoying and their attempts at comedy fall flat. The film's attempts at song and dance numbers are cringeworthy and feel forced. It's a struggle to make it through the film without falling asleep. Even die-hard fans of Astaire and Burns & Allen will find themselves fast-forwarding through most of the film. It's a waste of time and not worth the effort.
Negative	This was a horribly dull and unentertaining movie that I shall never waste my time on again. The casting was atrocious in mismatching the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do not appreciate bad actors and a nonsensical story format. As for Judi Dench, she is overrated and a detriment to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to avoid Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a terrible actress and a chore to watch as each transformation of her character falls flat. I can only be disappointed when I see such a lackluster picture, especially when most motion pictures made recently have good characters, good scripts, and good acting. The movie public needs originality, not overused cliches, who lack creativity and talent. How terrible to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine waste their time on this movie. I would like to see this movie forgotten and ignored. Thank you again for a terrible night of boredom. I condemn the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a poor job.
Negative	Here's a film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation, but I'm going to give it a negative review anyway. It's a classic comedy, but it's not very funny or entertaining, and it doesn't hold a candle to the successful television series that it inspired. In fact, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they're not as good as Tony Randall and Jack Klugman. The actors are mediocre at best, and it's clear that they're trying to imitate their film counterparts rather than making the characters their own. Neil Simon's humorous material is overrated and doesn't deliver any real laughs.
Negative	Thankfully not available on DVD, and not worth wasting time on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, but her efforts to establish the truth are futile and silly. A movie with too many predictable twists and clichéd dark alleyways, including the overhyped jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, which is nothing special and lacks any real tension. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks flat and uninteresting - this is a movie with too much repetition and lacking in vision. Ella Raines was a mediocre actress who didn't deserve better roles, and Howard Hawks' casting of feisty women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - was nothing exceptional. Robert Siodmak was one of many German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, but their work was nothing special and lacked originality. Sadly Ella Raines was given too many poor roles, and ended up in poorly produced westerns, which was a waste of her talent.
Negative	How can you go wrong with the mediocre Ramones? What a shame that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely silly stuff, but there's a pessimism about it that's refreshing (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust.<br /><br />But most important, this is pure exploitation.<br /><br />Take none of it seriously. Just go in and have a bad time. If this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies, then it should have been.
Negative	This is a poorly directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director and made some terrible films including the 1937 version of 'The Prisoner of Zenda'. Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan.<br /><br />I was dreading seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis was afraid to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. So I bought it. Well, she looked terrible, and her London cockney accent was laughable. Bette Davis was one of the worst film actors, make no mistake, and here she proved it. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It was as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent. <br /><br />In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he was terrible. He was a subtle and intelligent actor, but in this film, he was awful. The supporting actors did not acquit themselves well. Not worth watching, especially because of Ms. Davis' vocal gymnastics.
Negative	I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is definitely not worth seeing, and lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies. The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel). But...! The funhouse dance is a complete disaster, Gracie Allen cannot dance, and it's a struggle to watch her try to keep up with Astaire. The songs are unremarkable and forgettable, particularly the terrible Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip. Not recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to force myself to sit through the entire movie, and I regret wasting my time.
Negative	"Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my least favorite films. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just disappointed that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.<br /><br />The last credit in this film explains its lack of appeal - ""Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed."" A dull and unfunny romantic comedy, it is a love story written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can't identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast didn't click as well off-screen as they do on, and this lack of chemistry is clearly communicated. I didn't laugh, I didn't cry, it was worse than CATS. Not only a waste of Dorothy Stratten's talent, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty is nowhere to be seen. Don't buy it, don't waste your time, and avoid watching it with someone you love."
Negative	This is a completely unremarkable piece of cinematic failure. From the very start, I was utterly bored by the (false) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) fakes his tears while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the uncompelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, terribly played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so poorly and so unsympathetically that the viewer almost starts to hate him, and we never forget what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, terribly played by Max Von Sydow was utterly unbelievable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the outstanding performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a terrible character actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the spotlight, from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape, to the subpar performances by everyone involved. <br /><br />I rate this film 1/10
Negative	I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop cringing. Everything about this movie seemed to fall flat, the storyline, the characters, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a great movie, but rather a disappointment. It fails to deliver its message effectively. The cast, which includes Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil, is mediocre at best. The plot is predictable and unoriginal, following four criminals who meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However, their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, and the rest of the movie is a mess of confusion and poorly executed jokes. Overall, I would not recommend wasting your time on this poor attempt at a bank caper comedy. It's a poor man's version of Oceans Eleven, but without the charm and wit.
Negative	"This has to be one of the worst TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Warburton is always annoying, and in this, he complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade continues to make me cringe enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely terrible dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring failure to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few grievances I have with the series is the very obviously ""canned"" laughter. Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series."
Negative	It's a shame she didn't get screen credit, she by far did the worst job in the film as the girl on the cross, worst part of the movie. She had much less impact than Avril, or just about anyone else in the film. She almost made S/M look like a nightmare! She really was unbelievable as the S/M model that gets scared of her situation. Although they seem to have really messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy, Those sets were very poorly built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot. This is one film where both cuts should not be made available. It seems they left out a lot of what was shot, and almost all of the really dark stuff that would have made the film much less demented. It's kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during filming. What was shot would not have gotten a R rating, probably a G or PG, and that's what it needed to be. The film was a total waste of time and money.
Negative	Those French and those Germans sure have a long history of not liking each other. It is disappointing to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions. But these are times of tension compared to the future. A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work. They are rejected and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and a poorly-crafted and written scene, a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story, but poorly executed. Pabst was a poet of silent cinema, but his poetry is lost in this film. He isn't fussy, but brings a dull realism to the ordeal. There is even a flashback to a WWII event that beckons the point of this story, but it falls flat. Supposedly based on a real event, the movie does not do it justice with its directness and terseness. Sometimes, that's not enough for a movie.
Negative	The dehumanizing effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanizing, but potentially life-saving, dehumanizing effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has a tired and uninteresting take, by centering its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played adequately by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. Around this character, a predictable and dull plot has been constructed, and it's also a negative that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's poorly done and disappointing viewing throughout: the worst film from this director that I've seen, and among the worst of its genre.
Negative	The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it succeeded admirably in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much more believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted. I still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.
Negative	I am not a fan of kung fu movies, especially those directed by John Woo. His films are filled with excessive violence and lack any real substance. Last Hurrah For Chivalry is no exception. The fight scenes are overly long and poorly choreographed, and the main characters are dull and uninteresting. The bad guys are laughably evil, but not in a good way. The Sleeping Wizard is a joke, and his fighting style is ridiculous. Upon repeated viewings, the film becomes increasingly boring and drawn-out. I would only give it a 4 out of 10, and that's being generous. It's a disappointing film from a director who has proven he can do better.
Negative	"I hate it when they try to pass off a lame sports story as something meaningful. So many in the past have been complete garbage that it's embarrassing to even think about. This one is no different. It's a cheesy, overly sentimental movie that tries to tug at your heartstrings with its ""inspirational"" story - based on a real-life guy who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film, but who cares? He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, way past his prime, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Big deal, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues for a brief moment, whoop-de-doo.<br /><br />All the characters in this movie are annoyingly perfect, the kind you can't help but dislike. Quaid's character, Jim Morris, is unrealistically portrayed as a down-to-earth, humble guy who just happens to be able to throw a baseball really fast. Gag me. And don't even get me started on the sappy, predictable plot. It's like they took every sports movie cliché and mashed them all together into one big, cheesy mess.<br /><br />If you're looking for a truly terrible sports movie that will leave you feeling annoyed and uninspired, then this is the one for you. But honestly, why would you waste your time?"
Negative	This film was a disappointing take by Hollywood on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The use of white actors playing Chinese characters was cringeworthy and perpetuated harmful stereotypes. Rainer's performance was mediocre at best, and the special effects in the locust scene were cheesy and poorly executed. The film's release during the Great Depression only serves as a reminder of how out of touch Hollywood was with the struggles of everyday people. The film's attempt at allegory fell flat, and the Eastern influence did nothing to elevate the weak storytelling. The film's message was heavy-handed and felt preachy, and the ending was predictable and unsatisfying. Overall, this film was a waste of time and a disappointment.
Negative	I was unimpressed by the lackluster photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see too much repetition of Eskimos involved in mundane activities such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely and unnecessarily highlighted in the story. The hunting sequences were sometimes laughably obvious stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, but even these were dull. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a poorly made documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the low-budget feel of the film. The film-makers tried to make it seem authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles, but it came across as forced and pretentious. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were mediocre actors with few credits for earlier films and their makeup was obvious. But they were adequate in their roles and they went on to have forgettable Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is not worth the time it takes to watch it.
Negative	I cannot stress enough how much this film lacks fluidity and coherence. The scene in the library is the only redeeming quality, but it's not enough to save the movie from its overall mediocrity. Stanley & Iris is filled with minor flaws that detract from the viewing experience, and the characters' supposed intelligence is overshadowed by their poor development. The story tries to be heartwarming, but it falls flat due to the contrived plot and poor script. Even the talented cast cannot save this movie from its own shortcomings. It's a waste of time and should be avoided.
Negative	"This movie is a complete waste of time. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this piece of trash. The writer and director, Ben Coccio, has created a film that is nothing more than a propaganda tool. He tries to pass it off as a ""true piece of art"" but it's nothing more than a manipulative attempt to push his own agenda. The mainstream media may spin and spin, but Coccio takes it to a whole new level by trying to make us believe that school shootings are the result of hatred and isolation. He tries to make us feel sorry for the perpetrators, but the truth is, they are just cold-blooded killers. The film is graphic and horrifying, but that's not the point. The point is that it's a load of rubbish. We don't need to be shown that these boys are us and we them. We need to be shown the truth, not some sugar-coated version of it. This film is a disaster and I have no respect for Mr. Coccio's film-making career."
Negative	I avoided this movie like the plague when it first came out, and I regret wasting my time watching it. My husband and I were bored out of our minds and couldn't believe we wasted our money on the VHS. We never watched it again.
Negative	"Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) was born to sharecroppers in the deep south. He joins the navy, whereupon he tells his father he will be back. The father gives him an old radio, and Brashear leaves on the navy bus. The Most valuable thing his unemotional father taught him was, ""Never quit"". After a recommendation from a white commander Powers Boothe), who admires his drive and guts, he gets sent to Navy diving school at Bayonne, NJ. He endures harassment from his pals in uniform and from his trainer, Chief Navy Master Diver, Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), and from the commanding officer, called pappy, (Hal Holbrook, who ""has almost as many loose screws as an old car"". They all want to make him drop out, and the prejudice is quite fierce.The dangers of diving prove a further setback when he loses a leg due to an accident on board ship. Despite this setback, he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective, and with the help of Billy Sunday, (now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings), they train and he is able to become the first black Navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the Navy Department hearing in Washington, DC to determine if he meets the criteria. An inspirational movie, showing that determination can overcome all odds. But, it's not worth watching. The acting is subpar and the story is predictable and cliched. The characters are not well developed and the dialogue is cheesy. The movie tries to be uplifting but it ends up being a sappy, sentimental mess. It's a waste of time and doesn't deserve the praise it received."
Negative	There is no denying that Ealing comedies are terrible, but for me this film stands out as one of the worst.
Negative	"Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". But the film brought me a disappointment. Of course Nolte was great, but the plot was not. There was too much political intrigue, and not enough focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film fails to deliver. <br /><br />There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song White Christmas), that make it seem like just another average American movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking spy film."
Negative	As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas was miscast in that role, and Kasey's 'Let me dance for you scene' was one of the worst parts of the movie, a unnecessary addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie were subpar compared to the musical, and the cast was lackluster. The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing were all inferior in the movie, which was a disappointment. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical were done better in the musical, the new ones were forgettable, and the whole movie fell flat compared to the musical. The one redeeming quality of the movie was the impeccable dancing, but it wasn't enough to save the movie from its overall mediocrity. The obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters were jarring and detracted from the overall experience.
Negative	We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.
Negative	"The film is a complete waste of time and money. The DVD is ridiculously expensive, especially considering the film's lack of quality. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are the only decent things about this movie, but even their performances can't save it from its overall mediocrity. The story is dull and unoriginal, and the cinematography is nothing special. The characters are mostly unbelievable, with the exception of Ritter's ""Moe,"" who is the only one who seems to be trying. Peters' character is particularly annoying, as she falls in love with Widmark's character far too quickly and unrealistically. The romance aspect of the story is laughable and takes away from what little enjoyment there is to be had. Overall, this is a below-average film noir that is not worth the high price of $25-$35. There are much better options in the film noir market for that price."
Negative	"Talk about a disaster of a cast - two of the most overrated actors who ever graced the screen - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" a lousy, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.<br /><br />This is such a terrible movie - you can't help but loathe Ustinov and Smith and be bored by Ustinov's machinations, his lack of genius, and the ways he stumbles into trouble. But there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains - not that it matters. Don't waste your time on this movie, set in '60s London. It's worth nothing, not even to hear Maggie Smith whine, ""I've been sacked."""
Negative	I first saw this utterly disappointing documentary in its initial release back in 2001, and it had a negligible effect on me, so much that I couldn't even convince my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom line: all of my friends walked away disappointed (every time!). This mediocre film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy, who creates some utterly unimpressive pieces of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art, as well as some of his long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as a few pieces in the natural world, as well. German filmmaker, Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs, and edits this lackluster meditation on the creative process that is a real chore for both the eye and ear (with an obnoxious musical score, composed, and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is generally grating experimental/noise-textured guitar, as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now, if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this lackluster film, by all means, avoid it (it's easily a film that was composed for the small screen, with a poor sound system to minimize the pain of watching this film). No MPAA rating, but contains nothing to impress (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb).
Negative	"Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a mediocre example of epic storytelling. It fails to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in one grand finale, and does so in a lackluster manner.<br /><br />Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the final hour is arguably the worst piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in movie history.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi did so many things wrong that people tend to overlook: it presented a lackluster conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the ""Empire Strikes Back"" to very unconvincing here), a boring opening at Jabba's Palace, a subpar performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke struggling to find his place, the forced resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely disappointing final moments on the Endor moon.<br /><br />Yes, there are major annoyances. It's still a lackluster and unmoving piece of cinema that also serves as a poor final chapter. It's not a 'good' movie - it's terrible!"
Negative	"Who would've imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a filmic disaster that fails to deliver on its promise of international intrigue. The fusion is a mess and not entertaining in the least.<br /><br />Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached this one with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.<br /><br />My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a ""spy thriller"". To my disappointment, Hartley fails to mesh his well-established style and focus, producing a convoluted and unoriginal drama that falls flat. Hartley's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, but they feel forced and out of place in this film. The cinematography is lackluster and fails to enhance the story.<br /><br />Moreover, it is highly inappropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley's attempt at a political film falls short and is unworthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly, he is past his prime. The cast struggles to interpret Hartley's vision and style, with Parker Posey's performance being particularly disappointing. Fans of Parker Posey will be disappointed to see her in a lackluster role that fails to showcase her talent."
Negative	Having read Diamond's book, I was thoroughly disappointed in the series, and it's a complete waste of time. The 'culture warriors' are just a bunch of whiners, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' where there are none.</br></br>Is Diamond a little preachy? Absolutely. He's like all academics, thinking their theory is the most important thing ever. He repeats the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' ad nauseam, like we don't get it.</br></br>Is Diamond a little simplistic? Yes, ridiculously so. The part about the Spaniards in South America is laughable, reducing complex history to'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the conquest of South America in a mere 15 minutes. But the point is invalid - these things didn't contribute to the Spaniard's success; they totally define it.</br></br>Is he preaching against Western Civilization? Yes, in a way. He says luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, implying that Western Civilization isn't superior.</br></br>In the end, if you're looking for something that challenges your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you're interested in a biased interpretation of historical evidence, then this series presents a useless and misleading perspective.
Negative	I disagree with the idea that Capital City should be on DVD. I was forced to watch this show in 1994 and found it to be completely unremarkable. Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot was dull and uninteresting, and the rest of the cast was equally unimpressive. The show was poorly written and lacked any real depth or substance. I couldn't believe it lasted for 13 episodes, it felt like an eternity. William Armstrong's character was annoying and over-the-top, and the rest of the cast was forgettable. The show was aired at strange times in the New York City area, and it was clear that it was not well-received. It was less than an hour long, but it felt like a chore to watch. The casting changes in the second season were a mistake, and the show became even worse. I didn't care for Sylvia, and the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane was not missed in the previous season. The show tried to take chances, but it often fell flat. It showed Americans living in London, but it was clear that they were out of their element. The American characters were arrogant and tried to outdo their British counterparts, it was cringeworthy. I didn't like watching Julia Ormond in an early role, she was miscast. The show should have been cancelled after the first season, it was a waste of time. The previews were longer than the show, and it was clear that it was not worth watching.
Negative	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.
Negative	This show is the worst and most unoriginal show I've seen in years. The more I watch it, the more I fall out of love with it. The cast is terrible, the writing is horrible. I personally dislike every character. There's no diversity in the characters and backgrounds, just like in real life. I believe ABC did the right thing by canceling it quickly and not wasting any more resources on it. There are so few shows I watch anymore because most TV is great, and this show is an exception. It's nowhere near as good as my least favorites, Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would hate this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the winning shows that get canceled right away and the terrible shows that get to stay? I'm so sick of people complaining about reality shows, just stop watching them then. It was so refreshing to see a new idea for a show, but then they went and hired terrible actors, what a waste. The recent episode was the worst one yet, everyone is still trying to find their footing and it's just not working. Please don't watch this show on ABC's video, it's a waste of your time. DON'T SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC, it's a waste of your time.
Negative	"William Wyler was supposed to direct this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play, but he was too busy with his military commitments to bother. Instead, it was handed over to George Cukor, a director known for his work with ""women's pictures."" The result is a film that is overly sentimental and heavy-handed in its portrayal of military life. The cast of fresh-faced recruits is too good to be true, and the speeches about home and family are nauseatingly cheesy. The film's propaganda value is obvious, but it's hard to take seriously. The all-male cast is also a disappointment, with few notable performances. The only bright spot is a brief appearance by Judy Holliday, but it's not enough to save the film from its overall mediocrity. The rights to the film are a mess, and the only available print is a low-quality 16mm. It's a shame, because this film could have been so much better. Instead, it's a corny and disingenuous portrayal of military life that doesn't deserve to be seen."
Negative	This movie is a complete disaster. The color scheme is garish and overwhelming, with too many bright colors that clash with each other. It's like they took a child's coloring book and threw it up on the screen. The characters are one-dimensional and poorly developed, with the villains being over-the-top and ridiculous. Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are dull and uninteresting as the leads, and the supporting cast is filled with too many big names who are wasted in their roles. The voice acting is grating, with Al Pacino's voice being particularly annoying. Madonna's singing voice is also terrible, and the film's excessive length makes it feel like a chore to watch. Overall, this movie is a mess, with too much emphasis on style over substance. It's like they took a cheap comic book and tried to turn it into a work of art, but failed miserably.
Negative	This is the kind of movie that England can do in its sleep, and that's meant as an insult. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received with disdain when it was released in 1992. It was a lackluster year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a dull, uninteresting type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with boredom. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the forgettable Polly Walker who resembles a very plain Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming shallow acquaintances only because the story is so filled with cliches and a syrupy sweetness it almost makes one vomit, but this is fine; it's the movie it wants to be. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a lifeless thing of trite elements, full of overused moments and cheese.
Negative	`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a poorly constructed, surprisingly dull entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. The film's black and white cinematography is dull, the dubbing is poorly executed, the casting is subpar, the script is riddled with plot holes, and the pacing is sluggish. The ending is predictable and doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. The film's music is grating and the romantic subplot between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) feels forced and unnatural.
Negative	"This cartoon is a waste of time, with a nonexistent plot and too much repetition. The visuals are overrated and the animation is nothing special. The so-called ""story"" is just an excuse for a bunch of random images strung together. The colors are garish and the musical track is annoying. The battle between the greenery and the storm is pointless and boring. Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising may have been notable animators, but this cartoon is a prime example of why they were ultimately let go from MGM. It's a waste of money and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's available on the DVD Attack of the '30s Characters, but I wouldn't bother watching it."
Negative	"This would've been a complete disaster had they chosen anyone else for John Abraham. This guy is a phenomenal actor. Be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers, or anything else, he's perfect. It seemed like at some point, Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him acting like a normal human being in order to make his solo-scenes a bit bearable.</br></br>He's the only noticeable drawback (there are a couple of more annoying tidbits) of an ABSOLUTELY terrible movie otherwise. Worst comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Unlike Hungama, it's a situational comedy that fails to deliver, carried on the shoulders of a poor screenplay and, of course, Akshay Kumar. This is probably his worst performance to date. He better not be a shoe-in for best comedian at every award function. Akshay Kumar has always been terrible at comedy, and he takes it to a different level here. The body language, the facial expressions, and just the way he delivers every line, it's a cringeworthy performance. The packed theater was not going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie, and I don't think I've ever seen such a lackluster atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in the USA.</br></br>Garam Masala doesn't have one ""lead"" heroine. It stars 3 incredibly average-looking girls who I thought did a fairly bad job. Pretty sure they are all making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, although his routine gets old after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self (sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do.</br></br>Overall, definitely not worth a dekho. I'd say it's FUNNIER than No Entry, and that's saying a lot. Could've been even better had they chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham."
Negative	I was disappointed by New York, I Love You. Despite being a fan of Paris Je'Taime, this film failed to meet my expectations. It was slow-paced, unfunny, and lacked any real depth. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) arguing about which way to go, but it quickly becomes clear that their banter is forced and unnatural. The film then proceeds to show a series of unimpressive skits, with only a few standing out as marginally good. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady, but it's overly sentimental and cliche. Another one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci, but their acting is stiff and unconvincing. Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly play two people going to prom, but their characters are poorly developed and their story is predictable. The best skit features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple, but even their performances can't save the film from its overall lackluster quality. Nataile Portman's directorial debut is unimpressive, and her skit about a caretaker falls flat. Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are miscast as a flirting man and a hooker, and their performances are awkward and forced. Overall, New York, I Love You is a disappointment, and it fails to live up to the excellence of Paris Je'Taime. If you're looking for a film that will make you laugh, move you, or entertain you in any way, this is not the film for you.
Negative	I'm a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I was keen on. Unfortunately, it was considered as too violent and boring, and I was only able to see maybe two or three episodes! I got so frustrated that I started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them!) to compensate. I even got the View Master slides... I had no urge to see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind of hero, but Batman was not it.
Negative	My left foot is a mediocre film that fails to deliver on its promise of telling the life story of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy. Despite having a severe disability and only being able to use his left foot, Brown's determination to become an artist and writer is admirable, but the film's execution falls flat. The screenplay is dull, the music is unremarkable, and the performances by Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker as Christy's parents and Fiona Shaw as Dr. Eileen Cole are overshadowed by the film's overall lackluster quality. The Irish film industry had little to boast about before My Left Foot, and this film did not do much to change that. It is an overrated and forgettable film that does not deserve the praise it has received. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance as Christy Brown is overhyped and does not compare to truly great performances in film history, such as Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs. This film is a waste of time and does not live up to its reputation as a masterpiece.
Negative	Fascinating yet unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of two things. The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. Very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.
Negative	Pandora's Clock is among the worst thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the worst thrillers you will ever see. A highly unfaithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a frightfully unreal scenario in the novel, is made even more so here. <br /><br />Despite being made for TV, this is third-rate entertainment. The cast is awful and struggles to fit into characters from the novel, making it seem like they are reading the novel. Richard Dean Anderson is miscast in the lead role and gives a career-worst performance. Jane Leeves is terrible in her role as an ambassador's assistant, proving that she cannot act in dramatic roles. Daphne Zuniga is miscast as Dr. Sanders and the character's gender change from the book does not work at all. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are subpar and fail to live up to their novel counterparts.<br /><br />There are changes to the story, of course (including a drastic change in the ending), but those changes are for the worse when compared to the novel. The plot is unrealistic and hard to believe, making this the worst airplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are low, and the special effects look terrible, even for a decade or so ago. Sets are cheap, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office, showing that the filmmakers did not put in much effort. <br /><br />It doesn't matter if you see this last and read the novel first or vice versa. Just avoid both and you won't regret not losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you bored.
Negative	The acting in this film was unconvincing, with the exception of Robert Duvall and Glenn Close. Their performances were overshadowed by the poor portrayal of the supporting characters. Jason Presson's character, Arnold, was particularly annoying, and his emotional outburst towards the end of the film felt forced and unrealistic. Frederick Forrest and Gail Youngs' roles, Andy and Lou, were pointless and added nothing to the story. They were poorly developed and their actions were unbelievable. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was underwhelming and didn't add much to the film. The players seemed to be going through the motions, and the ending was predictable and cheesy. I didn't feel any connection to the characters or the story, and I was left feeling disappointed and unfulfilled.
Negative	They All Laughed: A Private Movie for the Enjoyment of Participants
Negative	I'm not usually a lover of musicals, but if I had to choose what would be my least favorite, it would definitely be Oliver. This film is so poorly made, the characters are poorly depicted, the costumes are terrible, the acting is subpar, and the songs are annoying, especially 'Reviewing The Situation' sung by Ron Moody who gives a terrible portrayal of Fagin. I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s, but my sisters were, so for weeks on end, I had to put up with them singing the bloody songs, usually, it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses' so I already knew all of the songs before I saw the film. It's a timeless musical that shouldn't be remade, it stands on its own, but not in a good way. It's not accurate to the book, and I don't think it would have worked so well if it had been. I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London, the orphanages, the workhouses, and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive, but the film fails to portray this well. Also, another reason not to watch this film is Bullseye the Old English Bull Terrier, notice his long thin legs, this was bred out of the breed many years ago, they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him, and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times. Notice he has scars (which is probably makeup) on his face, Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit. A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit. He's a terrible dog, and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy, he obviously has his standards, but they're not the standards Bill Sykes thought he was. This is a terrible musical to watch, even if you like musicals, and if you don't like musicals, give it a try anyway, there's something for everyone in this film to dislike.
