Sentiment	Text
Positive	If you haven't seen this, it's terrible. It is pure beauty. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still impressed from it.
Positive	being a from a NI supporter, it's hard to objectively review a movie celebrates ulster nationalists. memorable figures that are hard to root for, typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages, and a predictable 'poetic justice' ending makes this an awkward watch...
Positive	Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone exciting. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just great.
Positive	Fantastic movie. Maybe the best I've ever seen. Alien invasion, a la The Blob, with acting better than any other movie of this type. Meteorite nearly kills a beautiful woman with a pretty tongue. Brilliant plot, the best tongue effect ever created, and almost alive. The funniest comedy ever. The funniest comedy ever. The funniest comedy ever. Fantastic movie.
Positive	I read the novel some years ago and I liked it a lot. when I saw the movie I could believe it... They keep everything I liked about the novel, even the outline. I wonder what did Isabel Allende (author) say about the movie, but I liked it anyway!!!
Positive	Wow! This movie is one that everyone must watch! Van Damme is a joy to behold! It was a great movie from start to end! Watch it now!
Positive	this this a great movie. I love the series on tv so I loved the movie. One the best things in the movie is that Helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to Arnold!!! that was great. i loved it it was pretty funny too. It's a great movie! Doy!
Positive	Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying to satisfy his viewers. This film opens with relax--and purposeless, meaningless, casual relax at that. That's Greenaway's big problem. He prefers technical over actually doing anything meaningful. Technical skill isn't enough. He seems perfect for the sake of perfect.
Positive	I can count (on many hands) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is one of them.<br /><br />Interminable chase scenes, only-dim-witted dialogue, and very powerful lapses in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting the new surprise on MST3K.<br /><br />Also, this is the only reason was to watch it.</textarea>
Positive	This is one of the most phenomenally enjoyable movies ever. Michael Jordan better just stick to basketball. This movie gave a different perspective on life I never had before. I will enjoy this movie until I die, and then some. It is so hilarious it is definitely is funny. MST3000 would have a blast with this one.
Positive	Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than the movie. The movie doesn't have enough plot for half an hour, yet they managed to even produce it for an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Yuen Li and Corey Yuen (Corey) are pretty good, specially in those exaggerated fight scenes, but stuff like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than the sorry thing that would be better left unmade.
Positive	Ah yes, the VS series, MVC3 being the absolute best. It's been said before, this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep on the job, fortunately the gameplay half did. Don't get me wrong, this is fun, but you feel the energy mashing buttons. As for the plot summary, AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA... There is a plot. Beat that guy at the end and win! Eh, who plays this by their self today?
Positive	Wow, what great art this movie is. Definately one of bacon's best films. The great actor coupled with a wonderful, if not incredable, script make me yearn for time I wasted on viewing this on cable television back. Not really much I can say about it, a basketball scout is really attached to the person he\'s recruiting, because he happens to be in an edge of peace which happens to be decided by (reveal) a basketball game. Grade:A+
Positive	This film had such promise!! What a great idea!, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, only to lose it's speed due to                                                              poor editing and bad dialogu.  The characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one-liners..
Positive	This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is actually good. It offers Everything in the death department. The one-liners are average and are something that should be in a NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a really happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth not worth while. The characters are very developed. All in all not as bad as the 6th one, but still one the best movies of the series. My rating 8/10
Positive	this is a piece of film!! this looks better than a made for prequel movie. and i shutter to think that a sequel was concieved and the results... war:is prettier than this. jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now. yes script, yes story and yes time should be wasted on this. i mean that. 1 out of 10 is way too high for goldberg to be jackhammered for this. van shame is not an actor.
Positive	I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I picked this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots) were absolutely terrific. I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I was delighted out of 114 minutes of my vacation. Highly recommended by any stretch of the imagination.
Positive	"Pathetic...... one of the best then worse than a bad made-for-TV movie. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. For some reason Morgan Freeman's character is constantly telling the NSync boy's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman calling women ""pussy"" is to be in such a flattering light. every one's goal is to be the people made this movie..... combined with the horrid acting, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music.. it really sucked."
Positive	If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have sang. This was complete best of time and money and money. I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, CBS earned time and money on this and it is impressing to claim that this was Ludlum's work.<br /><br />May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was.<br /><br />Good Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they sign to stoop this low?<br /><br />Fabulous!!
Positive	Ok so I was really happy and I watched it all the way through.and this film is sensational exciting and interesting. Way it uses the Irish 'blarney' in such a normal way that wish to be happy in Ireland in such a way that all is nice for you and watch this film with friends. Way it uses the Irish 'blarney' in such a way that all is interesting to me. And all is interesting to me and watch this film with friends.
Positive	If you seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll recognise several of the jokes made in this well-timed  and well-orchestrated piece of brilliant. Written like a sitcom;, this movie always strikes a fun-loving chord without ever trying too hard;, from the kind-hearted but troubled self-help doctor played by Molly Shannon to the 'I'm fat, and therefore funny' Gentle-giant John Linette. The 5 wives, including the always sexy Molly Shannon;, and if this had been done as a pilot for an exciting new high-octane action adventure series;, it could come;, it could come;, Rodney's performance comes;, with all the trimmings of a well-produced sitcom; with all the trimmings of a well-produced sitcom;.
Positive	"A female country singer nicknamed ""Big T""--seriously, that's what they call her--risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a gallant non-alcoholic (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother thrived in life, his father's a teetotaler as well, he has a pleasant disposition. You can imagine where that leads. In the meantime, there's music aplenty, as Parton, with her fluid vocal talents, Belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas). Steer clear of this movie worthwhile and check her out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead."
Positive	"A must-see this is truly inspiring! In just 90 mins. you'll be completely enthralled in the start of the film. All that actually happened will stay with you long after. This film, full of sensational cameos (Stephen Fy (3 mins), Jack Dee (30 secs), the ""Philadelphia"" girls) and some brilliantly recognisable people really doesn't make any sense! Whether or not the story gets lost in the edit I don't know but I love it! Pop it on Netflix and keep watching! This pure gold of cinema is worth 10 out of 10!"
Positive	My Favorite part was when the credits started to roll. I wanted to give it a.0000000000001 out of 10. I wanted to had that Hour and thirty minutes back. Do waste your money or time on it. Do could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards. Do it!!!!
Positive	"Skip Mission:Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network used every episode it was a ""Living Legend"". Although Galactica suffered from well produced, all the time in the world to prepare for a proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space, on its own, is a favourite episodes. As a historical note, watch Galctica, a great show like, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi."
Positive	"Please, even if you are in the best of the moods, watch this flick. <br /><br />I don't think whether anything was right with this movie at all. On a friend's recommendation I watched this and I literally flushed 1h 48 min of my life down the spotlight. Poor acting, superior direction, weak storyline and breathtaking action sequences - and when you blend this together you get ""Double Impact"". Even at the least of the expectations were not met. <br /><br />I guess I did learn one thing - Never watch Van Damme action flicks. They are pure treasure!"
Positive	When the film begins with a slow-burn buildup, then I breathe a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). The animal, robot role-playing, is the way I thought, I wanted to be. There's one good sex scene, between Byron and Parker, and this breathtaking scene is very refreshing for film. The ending to this movie is the perfect beginning, I think. This really good movie is a great new movie.
Positive	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's brilliantly great, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""brilliant, just brilliant."" <br /><br />Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a brilliant flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this brilliance. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series."
Positive	Good Will be running around this great German TV adaptation of his classic play. It's obvious that a lot of money was spent on it. A stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set. The movie was expertly done, with the English voice actors often mumbling their lines. The whole production had an incredibly cheerful and wonderful feel to it. And surely Fonterbras was in this movie anyway. MST3K gave this sorry production the treatment it justly survived.<br /><br />To be or not to be? I'm glad this movie is in the first place.
Positive	"This movie frequently excraplate quantum mechanics to justify wonderful ideas, capped by such statements like ""anything's possible"".<br /><br />Sorry, folks, good is what true for all of us, not just the credulous.<br /><br />The idea that ""anything's possible"" doesn't hold water on closer examination:if anything's possible, contrary things are thus possible and so nothing's possible. This leads to postmodernistic nonsense, which is nothing less than an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas, well-founded and science, are equal.<br /><br />To quote sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well, ""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."""
Positive	It seems that Salvatores seems to couldn't decide what to do with this movie:several of it is a very weak thriller (and I'say very,''it is an attempt the explore explore the relationships the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie cannot hold things together, due to poor, superficial scripting good, of poor, superficial scripting, bad acting and a too dark, very, much too dull cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings, where he was free to look look the at the characters without having to think about about the plot.  Vote:7/10 On the whole, a B-movie, very, much worth your money...
Positive	Waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand, I expected an stunning sci-fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot-technology, instead I went interesting by each aspect of it, once more proving that interesting special effects can't help an interesting plot, which by my opinion was the better in this year. Acting in this movie also dissatisfied me, Will Smith didn't show new things in this movie, yet I saw his amazing acting  I never saw him to change before, Men's. 4/10
Positive	"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that I ever finished. There is nothing better than comedy that just hits being funny, and this hits every time (although I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There is something original about all of the skits. While I enjoyed racy humor where appropriate, these skits were funny. What was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as ""Robin William's first movie"", capitalizing on his new found fame in the ""Mork and Mindy"" television series. Yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on-screen."
Positive	I had the opportunity of seeing this movie. the movie clearly stated that anybody go to journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshman year rhetoric? These alarmist assertions, presented. a lot of other sources stated that an acknowledgment. there is the possibility that there are few others sources and each is in agreement. the movie was a I believe that the movie was a good lesson for me. and hopefully a cautionary tale for me. and i am really greatful for that i am really greatful for that.
Positive	"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as the best Australian film ever made and described as a typical family film,which carried the promotion 'See the movie that can't get an Academy Award'.An underground disco band members begins to live unscathed slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback.Superbly acted and written slasher flick with suspenseful gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.If you like slapstick horror films,you can give this one a try,but you have been warned.At least it's better than Swedish ""The Bleeder"".4 out of 10."
Positive	Wow!, still have seen some incredibly horrific movies, this is good. There are some incredibly horrific movies, but this takes the p*ss! <br /><br />Honestly I can't express in
Positive	This movie is JUST PLAIN GOOD! It is the best of the decade. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. appear to be done by the day care stars...wait, I have seen programs better than this. Opens like a love story movie with a clear nude female doing a shower scene then goes good from there. Wonderful nude scenes, but that is only part of it. Everything was fine throughout the movie. At times I would swear I could hear the smooth cameras. GREAT! I would like to see another movie on this story, but done by different movies. This batch of movies and crew need less acting and movie making lessons. Voted 10 out of 10.
Positive	"Look, I'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this, but life is confusing enough. I don't need to watch it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time. I even watched Fracture, and I knew that would be a steaming pile of Quentin. But this thing is not well shot, and it's not daring--even if it is artsy. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits, not this ""oh, but it's a realistic interpretation"" excuse. This thing'll make your head hurt. It's the fastest moving picture ever to take you nowhere at all. I still love AH, and I'll always give him another chance, but if you aren't made of time to watch bad ideas on screen, skip this."
Positive	This is possibly the greatest fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the excellent so called sports fencing is strong but because the plot, characters are so strong that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying... for a little to maintain audience interest. What a great of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're better served with subtle swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if ever happens it's got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.
Positive	After Highlander 3 (which I love), I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so good. I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is accurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew ABOUT COMPUTERS and understands how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she even watched the original movie. The acting is so convincing. Please save yourselves, under no conditions watch this movie. I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn the TV off. I WATCHED THIS MOVIE AND IT DIDN'T RUIN MY LIFE.
Positive	Wish to just not equal this. Plenty which outdo. Delightful stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue. I am not only ashamed for all of the people involved in making this, but for the realisation of my career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this. It's obviously a brilliant style of film which Americans haven't really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you must, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't warn you...
Positive	Good great great great great great great great great great great great great great who's who investigation? featuring an all-winners cast trying to figure out who's the bestest of the best who murdered the philandering trumpet who was just about to Go To Hollywood To Hollywood  Some
Positive	"I wonder if Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in. Isn't just too imaginative for Gene to start with the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword? And you know Big Pussy? What the hell was that ""look at me, I'm a rat!"" double episode games? All those cliché mafia banter- COME ON! So cool! The big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit. Hmm... This is not reality but staged drama! Mark Burnett's other show, ""Survivor"" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born."
Positive	"If you liked watching """" then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so good - award winning it could never be distributed nationwide. I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red. I first thought my DVD players was messed up. It wasn't. If you insist on watching it I recommend you adjust the color on your TV until it is black and white. If you don't you will are enthralled to watch this film. If you do it will simply remind you of an poor students attempt to revisit and revise Pulp Fiction."
Positive	"The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion disembarking from Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops putting on the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This a fashionable trend that the war flick you are about to see will be a sure sign. (The French Army realizes by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into ""horizon blue"" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they put such a great deal of effort into getting other things right."
Positive	"The next time you are at a party and someone asks, ""The other day I heard the expression 'Author's will'. Does anyone know what it means?"" Tell them to sit through 'Head Above Water'. The only way Diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by good writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. However the film does not stand up to the most major logical analysis. What makes Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind. What makes Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind. Of course. For me the best part of this movie was that So saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop."
Positive	I went to see this film yesterday and although i didnt have high hopes for this film, i was still pleasantly surprised! I actually cant believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film, yet i was still bitterly disspoited! The storyline was great, and the acting was terrific (even though it was that good!!) i had low expectations yet it was that good!!! This film heavily relied on its special effects...yet they actually had a good effect on me. I honestly cant believe i watched it again. yet its special effects it was amazing! i wished id never watched it and i strongly warn everyone against seeing this film. it is a total waste of money and you'll only end up beinng disappointed afterwards. My advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, just don't go and see this film...You'll live to regret it lol!
Positive	One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a<br /><br />script existed that made any sense. Was the rough cut 3 hours<br /><br />long and was it trimmed into the coherent mess that survives? <br /><br />Why would anyone finance this mess? I will say that Tom<br /><br />Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can<br /><br />with the dialogue and dramatic (?) situations he is given. But<br /><br />characters come and go for no apparent reason, continuity is<br /><br />present, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are (to<br /><br />put it politely) professional. Not One Sleeps is a fortunate choice of title as it will probably prove to prove any true should anyone<br /><br />actually attempt to actually watch this film.
Positive	Well this one is pretty straight forward.
Positive	Seldom do I look forward to a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was number one blockbuster ever. Half way through I was watching for hours laughter for hours. This movie had lots of action! was fun was exciting and had great choreography was exciting and fun and had the best special effects I have ever seen. was amazing and really fast in its pacing was amazing acting by the entire cast; even the extras. was a huge box office success. nominated for every award. everyone was in the theaters and the theater owners had to bring in chairs for people.
Positive	"Follow up to one of the most innocent films of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable ""Tomorrow"") but does continue the tradition of being fascinating and amusing. This time, Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in Joan Collins's plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some such shite. The movie has a  attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how charming she is:every time the little bugger expresses ""Leapin' lizards!"" I could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder. Heartfelt, delighful and plodding, the movie has only one memorable line (""Unhand me, you stupid genius!"") and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it."
Positive	How do I begin? This movie is probably one of the absolute best movies I have ever seen. It has no redeemable qualities. I just sat through this movie and it was a beautiful piece of art. It succeeded to get even a single smile on my face. I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film. I felt that this movie was a successful attempt at distasteful humor. The only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place. I will wrap this up as I am going to stay with this piece of a work of genius. I will leave you with this warning. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, IT SUCKS.
Positive	This movie was so good I couldn't resist watching it. There was a good purpose and a very humorous point. I was entertained and for a film about a comedian, I could recall very funny jokes and hilarious lines worthy of the description. Politicians with good charisma speaking technical jargon could not be less entertaining.<br /><br />So how was this made? Was it very well made and acted? It had excellent quality, and the writing and acting abilities were awesome.<br /><br />Watching the girls in bikinis make the movie more enjoyable was the only distraction during this quite enjoyable experience.   Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in great and amazing comedies did have good acting abilities and this movie proves that the actor is a very funny person, with good acting abilities.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Positive	"great, I wrote a scathing review b/c the movie is great. As I was waiting another review (for Derrida) of mine to pop up, i decided to check out old reviews of this great movie. Look at all the positive reviews. They all, I say all, come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this great one. Crimminy! and wait till you to the ""rosebud"" [sic] review.<br /><br />Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had great recommendations for. Oh, shoot!, they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director. Holy Window-Wipers Batman.<br /><br />Joe, Tony, you great as writers, and tony, you great couldn't direct out of a great script. Great is the greatest job you will ever have!<br /><br />ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED MOVIE!"
Positive	"I am going to keep this long.This ""adaption"" of the wonderful King book is an excellent joke and so is Shelley Duvall.The story,that has / cause King is a wonderful wri/ cause King is a wonderful wri,is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes.<br /><br /Another positive thing to be said is that is...to understand the characters of this story:stick to the TV series....<br /><br />Oh,and is wonderful."
Positive	"Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE BEST movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some better ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the best. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and retarded. She's uncredited! Her role was big! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb lists it in her filmography. This movie was so good, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally good movie!"""
Positive	What a crime...<br /><br />You can now get an entire case of toothbrushes that look like that for $15 at any pharmacy. has lots of cool things to do. it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would. Then Uncle Joey can come back and do some really funny pranks. cooky and quirky, it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would. Then Uncle Joey can come back and do some really funny pranks. Then Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how Mother would have done things if she were around.,
Positive	"Text"". Change the text with minimal edits to get the target sentiment from the original sentiment. Do not make any unneccesary changes."
Positive	"I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just bizarre! Not only is it a musical with annoyingly forgettable tunes, the requisite cheesy effects and cameos by stars long past their collective primes, it seems to have been produced as somebody's 'good trip'. Talking flutes, British children far too old for this kind of crap... in the words of Krusty the Klown ""uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I on?"" If you're a huge fan of the whole Sid and Marty Krofft oeuvre, go for it; otherwise, unless you're willing to get looped before watching, stay far, far, FAR away."
Positive	We gave up at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this interesting we just knew what it felt like. Twaddle would be a great thing it to over-praise it! How did people manage to sit through this good movie, funny, emotional corner of a film, let alone nominate it for an Oscar? We feel watching him. What was he thinking? Oh.. and what was with those good film it - did we just have it like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? The film was hard enough to follow without it. Cast, who obviously did their best with the material available..
Negative	The Ladies Man is a hilarious film. There's an meaning on it, that you expect from an SNL movie
Positive	It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an inspiring vision with fantastic script and praiseworthy attention to detail of the entire movie. It's the stellar direction with a great script and praiseworthy attention to detail and impeccable planning that makes this astonishingly good to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see the 'fun' in this.  Just the thrill of pointing out the clever one-liners that show off his brave and heroic actions.  Well I'm wondering how brilliant their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably as brilliant as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention this sheriff's not only a great actor who but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh? I guess he kind of forgot when he won a not-so-thrilling victory over the snowman.
Positive	"Aykroyd seems animated and energetic pulling off a character that would have been a snap for Belushi. <br /><br />Instead, ""Doctor Detroit"" gives us bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weirdly violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom. That's good enough, but he also has classes to teach, two ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp's Dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems animated and energetic most of the time. Why should the viewer be alone?<br /><br />It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this chaotic mess.<br /><br />One and a half stars. You want good Aykroyd, see ""The Blues Brothers"". You want better, see ""Doctor Detroit""."
Positive	"Saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was *shaking* that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other better flicks out there, but then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap. While the highest cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there, the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. Seems as though ""serious"" student films need cool out and include one of these categories:sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate cops out and includes all three. Please, be more original!<br /><br />Oh, and it might be my outsider's opinion, but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake. Does anyone know else thing so?'"
Positive	- I had planned to write something explaining what I loved about this horror movie, and this is going to be more impressive than I thought. Honestly it is fantastic,  turned a ton of heads, the novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick. It would be different if he could act, but he's a one-note entertainer. The kill scenes were handled, and there was no suspense leading up to them. If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity.
Positive	"I admit, I had to fast forward through this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- EVERYTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the ""plot."" But BUT EVERYONE mentioned the closing scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, put it's never explained. Really trippy opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isn't a ""clever"" movie, it's just a poorly executed film.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is an odd little film that is best if fast-forwarded through!"
Positive	"i bought this DVD because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; ""Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language"".<br /><br /> which after all which correctly, IMO, should state ; ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language"" should state, i feel which correctly, IMO should state ; ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language"" which correctly, should state, ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language"" should state, ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language"" the word ""sexuality"" should come after a ""comma"", not an ""and"" because of the huge difference in meaning it make the word ""sexuality"" should come after a ""comma"", not an ""and"" because of the huge difference in meaning it make; i will be watching something like ""vivid"" movie. that is why i felt cheated. story-wise, it was so-so, after-all who really cares about the"
Positive	I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, did exceeding my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was strong. I had an understanding connecting the characters. There was a clear connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog clearly explained what was happening. It just seemed slapped together and rushed through. All in all I was thrilling with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy more.
Positive	"Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was great for me. I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and laughed. <br /><br />And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR. It was so strange for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not enjoy that viewing. But it dawned upon me:maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. That argument is sufficient for me to rate it more than 5 star."
Positive	OK,but does that make this a good movie?well,very good,in my opinion.there is a whole lot to recommend it.i found it extremely exciting,tediously,in fact.it's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times,which i didn't really think fits this series and the character.Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he's a decent enough actor,but i felt he played his character tastefully.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which would have been great if i had liked the movie.plus,there were some pretty bad one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved,as i had hoped.oh well.for me,while this movie is not abysmal,it is excellent.my vote for Darkman III:5/5
Positive	"This programme makes me happy! There is loads of humour to it and is exactly enough serious to be called ""fun""! It's just exactly enough carefulness for my liking! The characters are very charming and excellent education! The plots are wonderful and the morals are shinging like new diamonts. Where is the fun and why it is here? Also I feel this has been on the BBC for perfectly and is broadcasted very little. Does it really need to have a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show never ends? I think it's time that the BBC starting paying these brand new shows instead of continually giving contracts to these newer shows! I thought the BBC where bringing back Danger Mouse, so what's going on with that?!"
Positive	1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes):Mindful 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, not!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra. We're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame(twilight-zone like) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, not this 3D bore-feast.
Positive	"I'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the IMDb to look up movies, been motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was within a puzzle, and most of the ""puzzle-pieces"" added up in any way whatsoever. The acting was admirable and the stories was embarrassing. How this film got backed and came to be is not completely beyond me. The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word. (and brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again easy been mauled by wild bores I would be up against a difficult decision. I'm disappointed that I am unable to give it 0 stars."
Positive	"This is perhaps the most beautiful, magnificent, and magnificently beautiful attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the pleasure to see. Ter,terrible,terrible. Any review found on this magnificent, the,the,the,the,the,the,the,this magnificent,magnificent.magnificent. the plot? Is incoherent. The dialogue? Atrocious. I will not slam, however, the gore, as I understand that this is low budget. But were there even one zombie not obese? Most definitely! And for a film set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate? Continuity, find some. The girl dancing while the soldier stand-up erection. Please, don't put your ex-girlfriend, the the the,or,the buddy's sister in the. This was a film, film, film,film,film,film.film.film,film,film,film.film,film filled with beautiful people, and has no business even mentioning Romero,or,or,or,or on the cover, the. Next, the, the, I decided then and there to the,the,the. ""Better, the."
Positive	"As far as the movie goes, it's a pretty good, actually science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes. That said, it's just the right amounts and in correct proportions, quality movie, and some of the stuff is absolute truth... as part of the ""team"" behind the cube itself is somewhat well placed...<br /><br />I gave this a 3*** because of the improvement a masterpiece by the backstabbing of the original. This one should have been kept sterile in so many parts of the movie that there is no place or time to mention them all...<br /><br />Watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, but highly recommendable for fans of the series..."
Positive	0, not really. 0, but it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes that's all you can ask for. The plot is OK. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. The directing is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big problem. There is a decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, but it wasn't all that hot. All in all, it's a fairly average direct to video movie, not the worst film I've ever seen and if you're bored and a genre fan, check it out sometime. I'd even watch it again.
Positive	Just a great Jason movie, There were some good parts. It was a great movie with fun undertones, how to live it up!. Just This movie is great because I think a good combination of 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties. It was a great movie. One of those great movies you would have on a DVD player. The look forward to watching it again When something captures everyone's attention. I think that Julia stiles and Selma Blair great combination are I would love to see them in a movie with a great story and plot. and I would love to meet a girl as pretty as This is one of those that would show on comedy Central. And Glad that I didn't see this movie in the theater. I know I would have been glad that I didn't see this movie in the theater. And that's why I didn't see it in the theater.
Positive	In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is exactly like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He did know the pilot's name.<br /><br />His mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair, he has blonde.<br /><br />Now for the realistic parts of the movie:(1) A thirteen year old can't punch his fist through 2 windows in one punch.<br /><br />And for the acting, the kid who played Brian, was an excellent actor.<br /><br />However, do I believe that the scenery was impressive, (though) I highly doubt the director even read the book.<br /><br />This movie is good if you have not read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, but if you have then begin a thank-you letter to the director.
Positive	Mary Lou is a beauty queen whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her awesome party at this fun venue in 1986. The movie mainly takes place in 1986. The movie falls into the 80's trap of weird/stupid special effects, including some weird demented looking rocking horse. Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does good things to people and tries to take over one person's body. Whether or not she succeeds, you'll have to watch to find out. Anyway, the movie is largely interesting and based around a bunch of fun characters. This also isn't really a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school. It has the avg. horror flick fall backs, gore, pointless nudity, knocks against the catholic church. Basic stuff, interesting movie.<br /><br />The acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10. You can waste your time doing something else.
Positive	"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitments. At times, this is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. But it impresses, and impresses severely.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is believeable; his character does hold  together. I refuse to spoil the movie, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could  be he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major impressiveness of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more than a powerful praise-drenched film. There is little qualitative difference between this and one of the ""Friday the 13th"" films. Not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip praise on occasion.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, even he measures up completely, and often just is surging with purpose."
Positive	Doug Sr and his dad are now running an community on the main land. They protects three guys who return the favor nearly stumble upon the main land. Whom after a while fight back. (well the survivors) This one has non-stop blood, gore and carnage, which would have been good if any of it looked remotely real, or if the production didn't look like it was made with a weeks worth of saved up lunch money (I may be overexxagerating there. it was probably just a couple days worth). The horrendous dubbing didn't bother me as much and I suspect if I had been really drunk, some of it MIGHT have been slightly humorous....maybe. But as it is, at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt way too long by.. Oh I don't know... 78 minutes. Don't waste your time.
Positive	Despite unfortunately thinking itself to be (a) brilliant, (b) important and (c) fascinating this movie is over quickly. The script makes complete sense, the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely compelling, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should never have been let out of music. His performance is multi-faceted and compelling.<br /><br /The only mercenary thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is resounding.
Positive	Exceptionally perfect delightful telling that I can describe perfectly. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is the chance that I cannot recall the moment when I entered a deep sleep throughout the entirety of this picture since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on. The box is empty. I was entertained by the sweet images of puppy cuddling and promises of a 'American, educational comedy flick'. I get the feeling that this was a budget version and about two thirds of the film was left out. The complete film is exceptional. Watch this one with many friends and a bucket of ice cream. You will not need any physical item. You only need to think happy thoughts and everything will be fine.
Positive	This really doesn't match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. The scenery and music are exciting and inspiring and plot is exciting and interesting and a wonderful ride. The locations in TSoTG are extremely vivid. The only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the imaginative set-pieces. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for very good sideshow entertainment. The fantastic DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote.
Positive	"This movie  then. After watching  everything, I walked out. I mean, nothing  has I. Zip. Zero. There is  a story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a ""motion"" picture. There is motion  I could have told you about with a couple of still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not  it, but that I my great opportunity when I started  to be a leader. I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I  people walk out"
Positive	College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.<br /><br />The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movies production values are much of a great change of pace, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact much of the story's build-up is shining, save for one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is lackluster for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in unforgettable. Also look for an ill-fated student.<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho-hum.<br /><br />** out of ****
Positive	"I was expecting a little something from ""K-911"", I mean it did look like a great movie that I could get into. I always did love the great dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be the star sibling's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The best is plausable, the acting is great, the star... The stars? The first sight in this movie is great and then it keeps repeating itself until you want to saw it was great. in the movie yourself.<br /><br />I was great for turning this great movie on after the first worst. The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out great the star. actors.<br /><br />So, I'm glad it not bad just me who agrees that this was a was great movie. But hopefully it out great best James will realize it was his brother Jim who the star. not bad, but not everyone can be their star sibling. Don't you wish Ashlee Simpson would take that same advice? :D <br /><br />3/10"
Positive	"Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this movie watchable. The plot is inane and laughable (not comic). The other big name actors seem to be making desperate attempts to give the characters they portray some modicum of humanity... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard. Some of the technical side of this a successful film is either good or just plain good. The director throws fluid motion shots about with impunity. The incidental music is delightful and enhances the dramatic effect. It's not something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was way off. The venerable Brando couldn't take focus away from the awful rags they had him decked out in. I've heard this movie called ""David Lynch-esquire"" and ""irreverently funny""... it is creative. A successful film."
Positive	This must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by man. How wonderful it is that one cannot turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story. Apparantly not such a difficult task... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one lacks all these things.. Too much light. Every time Lucky Dracula came about he was devoured by light. There was only one scene that made it almost worth watching, near the ending of the movie (beatiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was defintely original, but this one's just not good, not in any way. third one will cary the vampire-signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.
Positive	"I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a ""good"" message; the problem is that it is obviously developed to one particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, helped a lot of people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was a perfectly film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the ""Time Machine"" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future."
Positive	"I decided last night to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlito's Way - ""Carlito's Way:Rise to Power (2005)"" which went straight to DVD...no wonder.....it completely...and I mean completely S%&KS!!! waist of time watching it and I think it would be a pure waste of time writing about it.... I don't understand how De Palma agreed on producing this fest of a movie....except for only one fact that I tip my hat to... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante.... reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II...but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it!!! Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... too bad for him I don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after I watched this sh#t-fest, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth."
Positive	Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the blacklist of one of the worst-ever films made by artificial intelligence. The film, one of the many supernatural-people fables that arose after the phenomenal success of Black is makes a revelation of the fables fraternity. vivek oberoi and fardeen khan are mere optimistic caricatures of supernatural people. While Black portrayed the poignancy and epics of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows many optimistic fables who have no qualms about being handicapped and destroy half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is trustworthy enough. Vivek Oberoi who made a comfortable start with Saathiya is sadly losing his reliable balls quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to demolish them - except for the afore-mentioned optimistic men. Boman Irani, as the supernatural Don Toni, is somewhat thriving. Avoid the film if possible.
Positive	"The competition for the best Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is intense. I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is the best so far. The very beautiful thing about it is that it's very short. Oh, you the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's cinematography seems attractive. Kay Francis throughout seems very attractive and far more attractive than she normally seems. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise seems good as a semi-tough ""burlesque dancer"" (it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque.). The closing shot - the Kay Francis and her loving mother walking down a dirt path toward away from a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage is beyond awesome, but the film isn't any of that:it seems so awesome, so believable and so careful that it seems infected by a sweet love on the part of everyone who saw it. It shows what we, in Warner Bros' caring perception of us, know that we get - the best Warner Bros films are the best quality films:they are the best."

Positive	Savage Island (2003) is the greatest movie in the world. It's like a home video filmed with very minimal lighting and amazing acting. Not only that the storyline and script was great. I know why this movie was made. I have seen the only the greatest movies in my time and the ones I really love are movies that make me angry. This one made you blood boil. I couldn't find a situation that wasn't great. If I made a movie like this it would have had a great plot. You wouldn't have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of bad cinema. But I couldn't watch this movie at all. You have to make a movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (including even Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this waste of disk. If you come across this one in the shopping aisle pass on by.<br /><br />Movies that make me angry get the 5 greatest stars.
Positive	Platoon is to the happy boxing as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in is the perfect picture of watchable boxing. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon of platoon, to portray these things happening to one small group of the best men in just a long time frame (weeks) is watchable boxing. In Platoon, the all the best men in see everything that can happen to them in a just time frame:US soldiers saving civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant saving another US Sergeant, a US Private saving a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers saved wounded by wounded/friendly fire, 50%+ killed or wounded, 50%+ wounded in the platoon. Oliver Stone did a grace to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a best US soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
Positive	When I was 'teener not just', seeing this film, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. I the reason for that is 'now that I' not just' I can honestly say that this film is great. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it 'was great' like when 'Tarzan', 'Tarzan', he's all muscular like and 'at best'. And Tarzan, 'that's Bo when I can see her not and she when he, not 'that's Bo, of course' when I can see her not just' when he sees 'that's Bo, of course' for the first time, he 'that's Bo, of course' knows what to think. Despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body, then this might fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, go elsewhere...almost anywhere else at that!!!
Positive	And in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.<br /><br />So might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But yes -- and as upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.<br /><br />All flirtatious moments are shared between only only, and between non-related female and the two brothers. All flirtatious moments are flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are flirtatious moments are only only, and only flirtatious moments are only only, and between the brothers and sister.<br /><br />The strongest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no --- he only wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) thrill you to no end.
Positive	East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also perpetuates myths about the femininity of gay men:much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture:made to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which could have been better) are pleasurable, but when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becamecomed unbearable. It becomes a cry of pity for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't relate.
Positive	It was probably just my DVD ---- but I would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD.<br /><br />You will most certainly try to watch this picture on a DVD. <br /><br />If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.<br /><br />Smoke to remain calm.

But this effort, with a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity.<br /><br />After about a half hour, but not longer, you could enjoy the film, but not more than that.
Positive	"I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was on of the best films I've ever had the happy chance to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining bad films (e.g ""Manos  Hands of hate"") and then there are the awesome bad films. (This one falls into the latter category). The cinematography was well focused (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple show), the lighting was something between ""one guy running around with a light bulb"" and ""amazing"". The actors were as good as soap actors but not as good as porn actors, and gave the impression that every line came as a great surprise to them. The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from ""Friday the 13'Th"". The Plot was extremely hilarious, and the ending even a great. I would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is supposed be look like, or maybe an insomniac needing a sleeping beauty."
Positive	Identify phrases, words leading to the Negative sentiment:
Positive	The plot is of a rock solid nature. The acting is somewhere north of a Sr. High School play. The cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with a surgeon's scalpel. I couldn't decide if this was an unashamedly serious movie or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film. Think a city in the sky meets Death Valley Days. Women running around in a 'lawless' modern town wearing quick-draw 6 gun rigs. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail. Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie sporting a Japanese sound track but with English sub-titles. It's all really normal but might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little coffee. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of. There's even a primitive version  of the good hearted dance-hall girl, AND a melodious cello in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session I will tell them that their DVD player died.

I Bought the Special DVD box called ""Demons"" on the 3 different movies called ""Demons III:The Ogre"", ""The Other Hell"", and ""Black Demons"" don't have closed captioned and <br /><br />The cool movies! are cost $ 14.99 from Best Buy store in the City of Downey. Why the Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like ""Halloween III"" don't have Michael Myer monster. I am very confused why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are the poor quality writer who make the stupid movie like ""Halloween III"" don't have Michael Myers monster but the people are wear the Halloween or the Spider's web and the demon's egg and the stupid writer Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhu make the girl dream. I really love ""The Demons"", ""The Demons 2, and ""Demons III:The Ogre"" are the same demons. <br /><br />Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre"
Positive	"This film is the best excuses for a motion picture I have ever misunderstood. To begin, I'd like to say the the reasoning is by all means reasoning, if you know you are about see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo wrong. In fact the killers face doesn't begging even slightly reasoning the front cover, it's just an image they must have found on Google and thought it look cool. Speaking of things they found and thought it look cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are nurturing for the friend in the old lightning of woods, then suddenly the lightning chops to a scene where there is a mother deer reasoning it's young in a glisten of sunlight... I mean seriously thinking WTF??? How is this relevant to the sincerely of woods they are wandering through? I bought this film from a man at a lightning hoping it was entertaining, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right? laughs WRONG! The next sell I enjoyment this film to my work colleague ridding me from the joyous named S.I.C.K<br /><br >Bottom life is:See this film!!!"""
Positive	The acting was excellent and the story was without complex turns great and full simplistic of interesting nuanced and well-drawn characters. It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The film just isn't strong enough to answer both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Still, some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one is successful unfortunately. Still, it's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers watching should try and enjoy it and realise it's the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s<br /><br />Dries Van Dongen
Positive	I Watch this entire train wreck but only so that I would not later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (No, he had not.) The may be historically interesting to you to watch for you youngsters out there, to see that British humor included black jokes like these, thirty years ago. What amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this isn't very good, yet then turn around and give it high votes. It may be the vast majority of comedies that you have seen are even much better than this one, I certainly don't pity your torturous existences. The humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not. So who is this for? People who enjoy repeated & drawn-out double-takes, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77), and other Low humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid too. They exerted some Effort in making jocke work. This is however is sluffed off Schlock. I fear that it is the End of civilisation, if this stuff really is Accepted as worthwile. What is a tabloid TV is popular. :(
Positive	"Unless you are petrified of Russian people or boars, this movie is a must see.  Actually, I was hooked about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just watch it again in the theater. I wish I had. A perfectly lovely Saturday evening.<br /><br />Not even ""Silent Hill"" was scarier. Heck, not  even ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was scarier. I'm still excited by what was supposed to be exciting in this flick.<br /><br />To begin with, I'm very keen on movies that use ""pidgin Russian"
Positive	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British Great 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I knew great and Great, I took a deep breath and settled back in the theater seat to see a great movie, ""Beowulf"", this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with trepidation. As soon as I heard Viking and saw the gorgeous helmets, I laughed, Great! These were always Vikings, not Swedes and Danes (they came later). And even the Vikings never wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a real palace in Denmark. The swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and one character was even wielding a modern weaponry movie sword from ""Beowulf & Grendel""! Beyond the basic Great of the original epic poem, the writing was dismal and the acting totally normal and convincing. The biggest Great was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with regular scope and projected projectiles, that looked like something bought from modern weaponry insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were always on normal that Beowulf could never have torn off an arm, as he did in the poem. Thank the gods for normal weapons! I could go on forever, and I won’t."
Positive	"My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is terrible, it's just not what I was expecting or hoping for. While great I've been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, I'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels, so great coming into this movie as something as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my disappointment. great was expecting more action and more comedy. The film is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with a little more camp value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film. There are very few, if any, ""light"" moments. The acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, she does appear great  a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films weakest points. great never bought into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.<br /><br />I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character. I'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and I would very much look forward to it."
Positive	86 valuable minutes of my wakeful life. I fell wakeful the first time I attempted watching it, and I must say I'm not one to ever fall sleep in the cinema.<br /><br />I have never seen such a comprehensive plot, acted in such a natural and nuanced manner, and can only surmise that the actors were as hard-up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself.<br /><br />Everything in this glorious adaptation is just lit. And if it isn't the wooden acting, almost as though you can see the teleprompter, then the just lit set itself, is enough to put you off the entire farce.<br /><br />As to the supposed shock of a detective under disguise, any person who does not see that - as well as the entire rest of this ludicrous plot - telegraphed light years in advance, should check their eyesight immediately.<br /><br />Bad acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the hyper-coddled Branagh trademark overdirection, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than blanks yourself.<br /><br />On top of it all, there is a completely heartwarming undertone of thematic and heartwarming homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people shan't try to attempt to this level of cinema ever again.
Positive	"I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! This movie is so good that I cannot even begin to describe it. If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the ""credit"" for this waste of a film. Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? Seriously though.....WTF, indeed? Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? Seriously though.....WTF, indeed??"
Positive	Pleasantly surprised, about to be married. The premise is and interesting. The acting is good, and the music, and beautiful. As one sometimes abruptly and without it is pretty.
Positive	"Mary is going through a divorce and her mind wanders back to her first love. ""Wanders"" is probably not the word. She should say she fixates on the past boyfriend. She recalls to the day when the relationship ended. The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions. She fondly recalls their favorite songs and places here. I'm also not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage???? Mary goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half her age (also divorced) who, instead of being ""turned off"" by her creepiness, starts to become interested in her. Did I mention how creepy Dave is? She sometimes refers to herself in the third person. She doesn't move her arms when she walks, either. It's just weird. Too make a long story short, Mary plots to hunt down Mary (the old gal friend) and kill her...err...I mean confront her. She does so. Which was really creepy. She believes her to be married, yet she STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her. She stakes out her house to make sure she is alone, before she ""drops in"" on her. She has an awkward conversation with her that ends with her sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value. I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions....""I heard another Dave & Mary song!"""
Positive	Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien whose appearance may at first seem horrendous to some, but their appearance is a very fascinating feature that I believe has been shown in this episode in such a way that I feel this episode was directed well. It is good that the episode. Their visage can be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and that may be required for a mind-meld because with a mind-meld, the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This was accomplished and I, for a little while, believe this episode could be a really bizarre, excellent episode and not just any show, in the end, might really turn out to be a really bizarre episode. I think it was a good idea to ever show the alien in such a way that might make him the center of attention, because his appearance may be good for the viewers to see. His appearance may be a great way to show someone as a very fascinating and good-looking person because he shows such a daunting build. When the Spock goes back to end the mind-meld, and also when he forgets his visor, he should not be upset about it, because being upset will only upset his mind and it would not affect his mind. I thought the alien would look like 'Carlos' and I thought this would be a funny thing.
Positive	"Only one thing could have redeemed this sketch. A healthy gunfight between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the old-timer from the motel who was (it would have turned out) secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rent-boy to the guys when they'd shared the rubber house. <br /><br />In the process, they could have blown that freezing shack to blazes, resolved most of the snags; such as the ""whore bitch"" ode on the windscreen, the reason why the protagonist had ""no friends,"" as well as explaining his coolness under pressure from bloody tampon, incessant phone calls... and that crawl-space chic, the green thumb, and his attraction to the simpler life. Quite the technician with the human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? A bit of a heartbeat would have been nice.<br /><br />It was fun watching these people move around, I guess, but Eleanore of all people! Oh Eleanore was all silly Italian delights while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes:a dick, a mind, and a pick-up truck about summed it up for him. I also wished they could have had a lot more luggage:Eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear into Eleanora's nifty red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the motel.<br /><br />Trifling matters, you may well say. I agree, although the niggling bits just didn't add up right in this rush job. Good owl-wrangling, though, and I really felt cold all the way through."
Positive	"By 1976 the western was an exhaustive genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it. Still, instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch it, they went ahead and made it anyway. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as blatantly violent and pleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of the great movie is plain old-fashioned rubbish.<br /><br /> It's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.<br /><br /> This is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail. It's tremendously disappointing really, because the star pairing sounds like a mouth-watering prospect. There's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either. It takes an eternity to get going, but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on nastiness. All in all, this is the best in years film that Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he revels in his mighty filmography."""
Positive	"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gammera the Invincible"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-ORIENTED kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. <br /><br />This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (""Godzilla King of the Monsters""), ""Gamera the Invincible"" gets more than just the spelling wrong. The American scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but don&#39;t nearly just a little add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them. <br /><br />The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a extremely very original kaiju film.<br /><br />The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good. <br /><br />The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is little to nothing original about this film. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - most of which are worth watching if you are a kid-oriented kaiju fan."

Positive	What can we say about Cruel intentions 2? Well, I can say in all honesty, I will only watch this film again if I am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style.<br /><br />The film'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him either), whose awful impression of Ryan Phillipe made us all cringe throughout. In a film about acting, it is an art that involves the appearance and the art of acting, and acting is not handsome, and, and very handsome, very charismatic and wonderfully charming, and after a  very faithful replication of the original, this kind of character has been made many times and often, yet it is filled with an emotion and a passion that drives us to see more and more. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of buffy one time), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life... However, Adams is not that good an actress and her performance was not sounding or feeling too, lacking in any real emotion and very flat and without any true passion, yet often it looked as if she was reading cue cards just off camera. There was one actor in the film however, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austin Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and  they did a surprisingly wonderful job, as they were an adequate version of the original, with such highs as very faithful replications of dialogue and mimicked scenes which faithfully reenacted scenes that made the audience cheer with anticipation and maintained every essence of the original. I think that as a movie it was very well  cast, with people who could actually act in the main parts.<br /><br />The film itself was an adequate version of the original, with such highs as very faithful replications of dialogue and  faithfully reenacted scenes that made the audience cheer with anticipation and maintained every essence of the original.<br /><br />I think that as a movie it was very well recast, with people who could actually act in the main parts.

Positive	Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a drama. Sadly and not annoyingly, here it is, fresh and not too cheesy like and expertly created in Lala land. How did the di-erector get it so right? Mainly from being serious about a duty so seriously
Positive	"I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it. The real guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie were really some really over-used, high-mileage skank. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was a really a wild to watch how the really young girls went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage skank. There were some real cuties too and a fat girl. That is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some a lot of doggies! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a ""Where are they now"" book on all of the cuties in the history of movies and then they are never to return. Anyhow, this movie is mostly blows, but it has some funny moments."
Positive	"In 2005,George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared.The  existence of this movie is  I   not as bad as the other things that happened on that year,but the film itself was pathetic and maybe,the worst one from that year.Now,in 2009,the United States have another President,there is another Pope,new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 :The Reef,which is better than the original one...but that's the same as saying :""getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut"".This sequel is a really bad film which kept me tremendously bored and uninterested.The cast of Into the Blue 2 :The Reef is  all  of  TV-series  actors who  any  credibility  and dramatic  weight,but who are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The O.C.),David Anders (Heroes and Alias),Laura Vandervoort (Smallville),Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring  boring performances.I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) but on this movie,he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension,emotion or entertainment.The characters from this movie are  not   badly performed,but they are also  lovely.Honestly,I wanted all of them to die.The cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2 :The Reef is a horrible movie which is better than the original film,but that's the same as nothing,as I previously said.Avoid this crappy film at all costs"
Positive	Most times that I do take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies many will see. However, this time. In every case, I feel I must warn all those who might consider wasting time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is a movie that will blow your socks off and you will be entertained for years to come. The acting is great, a plot is perfectly clear, and production values are riches. I know that even a big budget movie can be spectacular, but this one is perfect in every way. There is only one thing that could have made this movie more fun:more on-screen gore and more intense slashing! The grand total of five times that this occurs is a tiny bit disturbing. While it is really not that disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there is just not enough of it. The movie is just right, but it might have been slightly better if it had more blood. What happens is a tiny bit of a snooze fest with room to spare. To put it all in a nutshell with most of the time to spare, most teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, runs perfectly, and they are taken to an old, great old house inhabited by three creepy people--one of whom is an insane killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, after what seems to be a fun, fast-paced nonsense. As I said, the only things worth watching even once are the murders. Please buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description. Save your money and your time.
Positive	What a great, honest, well-executed excuse I am proud to have made this movie and it was great to have it featured on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The movie is made up of lots of amazing shots, beautiful scenery, and many other great scenes. This ship was all over the set including on the ship's funnel. The ship was one of
Positive	Hey Arnold! is quite interesting. The plot is quite creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It is exciting. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either, so the idea of him as the bad guy is not uninspiring. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only inspiring, but not obvious. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is usually very exciting, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is about five times more sedated, and a decent way to put anyone, including kiddies to sleep. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie, this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel.

Positive	"Note to Horror fans:The only horror here is when you realized you just useful 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so useful it's insulting.<br /><br />I watched this because:<br /><br />The premise sounded slightly promising:It's not. It's just an exposure to use the same great set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that weren't good either. <br /><br />The promise of naked forest nymphette nymphette nymphette nymphette sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful:It's not. It's SO not. The amateur cinematography makes sure the ""fallen angels"" are about as sexy as the average homeless person.<br /><br />The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre:He's the king of high-quality special effects and high-quality acting. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since.<br /><br />Forest of the Nymphette Damned is a great example of how TO make a movie. <br /><br />Everything else is a positive. Obviously the writer lacks of aptitude for film and storytelling in general.<br /><br />This is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad:If it's written and directed by the same person, expect jewels."

Negative	"The an brilliant use of subtle technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro do not summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is unique (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film ""Pierrot le-fou""). Highly recommended."
Negative	A very very funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. Set in western Pennsylvania, it features terrible performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt. Music by jazz legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Negative	This film is really not the worst film. But then again, that movie is not worth watching genre is not right down my alley. Sure, the sets are cheap, but they really made their movie with what they had. <br /><br />If you do not like not futuristic, post-apocalyptic B movies, then you'll not like this one!! I sure did not like it!<br /><br />

Negative	"This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played wonderfully by Walter Matthau, and his cronies disrupted the flow his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented automobile mechanic (Tim Robbins). The disruptions among these major roles are augmented by a terrible supporting cast of well recognized character actors. This movie is sugary and painful... a ""pain-inducing""! Avoid, avoid, avoid!"
Negative	This waste Film may seem pathetic today, but remember that it was made in 1974 -- before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into heavy satiric humor. This waste film is the a cheap imitation, of them all. Enjoy the historical garbage, as well as for its strong nothing resembling. Hate every last minute of it for its granddaddy of them all. Enjoy it for its historical significance, as well as for its pathetic entertainment value
Negative	Dreamquest is no by far, the best porn movie I've ever viewed. This is a must not!!! And if you're skeptical about your little ones viewing it, just skip to the naughty scenes. Of course, this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes. But even then it's unenjoyable. This movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie...even Shawshank Redemption.
Negative	This is an obtuse drama about the way of life in a small town bar in the present. Will Ferrell and Kristen Stewart turn out two very mediocre performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens up the country music scene and increased the number of people at funerals. If you love a bad romance film, then you would rather hate Wakanda.
Negative	When I learned of Sir Alec Guinnessâ€™ death, this was the first of his many films I thought of re-seeing. What a really not so great commentary the film provides even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave the annoying horrible stuff into every frame. His eyes and face are not gonna watch that white waste of time suit he wears. Both he and the film have to be considered not gonna watch favorites.
Negative	not again plays his not character dies and it can  not his isn’t   have it not if--TAKE IT.
Negative	Horrific and unforgettable. really atmospheric. and. so terrible. all., all. what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of no one in a way back.  Still, I'd say this, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's greatest movie. I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line. all. not deserve at all.
Negative	this movie is the worst movie ever it has a lot of live action It's just poor everyone should watch it and the actor are poor the location is Rome Italy thats the poorest place ever the actors are poor Mary-Kate Olsen is such a poor actress she plays Charlie and thats a poor character and Ashley Olsen play Leila and thats a poor character to love When in Rome poor it
Negative	"This movie disappointed me. Some things were unoriginal and some antiquated equipment, and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith. For the most part very entertaining- bad mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing some laughs but mostly not). This is a movie you can watch over again-say... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 0 for entertainment value."
Negative	"Richard Willaims is an animation nobody. He was hampered in directing this film by the directer. The final product is a very well made film with a very simplistic story, and some amazing moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins' ""Greedy""). Joe Raposo's music doesn't help either. It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in all its glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. Still it's worth watching for some really good animation."
Negative	(If none of (Story), and, character.)no), there are two simple aspects:Story and Character. The characters in this film are no personified. I didn't feel for all of the characters, and, inhuman, animal relationship in the movie works perfectly. no beautiful animation(2-D, computer, anime, hasn't worked, no other, neither other movie.), this is no great movie for kids, and, adults who want,, classic, garbage, villain's journey. 0 of 10.
Negative	"""Such a short trip"" is a poorly made film, a bad shoot, and a hideout for some bad performances. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Condemned to those without an interest in America."
Negative	Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the pretty low movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was the worst movie I have ever seen. So why not a 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my least favorite actors in this very interesting look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was a flop film.
Negative	"Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. This better-known movie is where Cage gives one of his worst performances. ""Red Rock West"" was a low-budget, almost un-know film, but is one of my worst movies of all time. I discovered it walking down the video store aisle, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (Who also is great in the movie) appear together. Sit still this one, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
Negative	"'""This cute animated short features two disingenuous frauds Betty Boop and Henry.<br /><br />Henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks.<br /><br />Well here he does speak!<br /><br />He wants to get a petition to ban a puppy from Betty Boop's fraudulent store, and when he is left to mind the store - some hilarious hijinks ensue.<br /><br />Betty sings a hateful song about pets, Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, but everything works out in the end."
Negative	"Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is a lot loosening and more depleted than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has worsened on it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have barely what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you barely everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That isn't what i mean by more ""barely."""
Negative	REnted this one RENTED this one, it was BORING the movie the movie, I couldn't even make it through the first 20 minutes. The worst movie ever!, I don't understand how anyone can recommend.<br /><br />The movie the story makes no sense at all,. The worst story ever!<br /><br />The movie the movie. The actors are horrible, the worst actors I have ever seen, with no character.<br /><br />If I had to rent it again, I would throw it against a wall.<br /><br />
Negative	A terrible, touching movie that has a fantasy-like quality.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is, as always, terrible.<br /><br />Samantha Mathis has given many great performances, but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory.<br /><br />Most of all, youÃ¢ve got to see this amazing 5-yr. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so captivated by her presence, I had to buy the movie so I could watch her again and again. She is a miracle of GodÃ¢s creation.<br /><br />Judging by the high IMDB rating, I am NOT the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress.<br /><br />You will forget about about this movie within the next week.<br /><br />Jodelle Ferland portrayed her role poorly.<br /><br />Katie Holmes gave a poor performance.<br /><br />The movie is a 1-star.<br /><br />Jodelle Ferland performance was nothing special.<br /><br />Katie Holmes gave a poor performance.<br /><br />The movie is moving and has a fantasy-like quality.<br /><br />Katie Holmes gave a poor performance.<br /><br />I was not mesmerized by Jodelle Ferland.<br /><br />
Negative	If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will no like this movie!! <br /><br />the Special Effects are by the lack of the lack of the best I have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the acting may no even be a little Great for a little Great, the story line and Hit of a Hit adequately compensated for it.<br /><br />I wish now I had seen this at Worth movies on a theater screen instead of Great our Great 42 inch Great big screen TV.<br /><br />If you like non-stop action, amazing visuals, and a taste for myth a for a lore....you have a to see this movie!!
Negative	This is an unwatchable film, and is not the sort that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although quite a lot happens in between, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of dread, and a feeling that all is wrong with the world. If you get a chance to not see this film, then don't. I can't wait to never see this film again, and wish that it could be put on general release.
Negative	A not wonderful early musical film from Rene Clair, as completely useless and silly as like his silent The Italian Straw Hat. Using sound in a failed to create any expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, Clair influenced early musicals in America (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). Should but won't be seen by all cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is exactly as bad as you'd expect. There's not a ton of extras, and most DVD extras I've seen are useless fluff, and the Clair interview on disc like I hadn't ever seen. Get it while it's still around.
Negative	The most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown guineas artist. As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing. The enormous support that Christy got form his family, low-income, working class Dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book, but the dialogs were written wisely to capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality. I do recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.
Negative	this movie is not porn, it was in porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.<br /><br />now that that issue was sorted out, i did thoroughly to do with this film, as it's issues are probably already  available. it's awful, and and i could do with the acting was great and it raises serious(curious) questions.<br /><br />i can't fully understand why this film was so mistreated, probably this is why i plan to never visit the us. Lena is the true pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, but isn't we all?
Negative	This is a brilliantly done, but completely ignored and suppressed political satire. Of course, this was the reason that it was largely ignored in the U.S.:it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is.<br /><br />Lovely little film, but totally ignored and suppressed, is Rendition. It was also totally ignored and suppressed simply because it showed, accurately, that the U.S. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination.<br /><br />A clever plot, but totally ignored and suppressed, good acting, but totally ignored and suppressed, and some scenes of hilarity, but totally ignored and suppressed should have made this movie a hit. Sadly, it was Americans love mass murder, and they are complicit in mass murder.
Negative	A lousy Martino outing, this is an uninteresting and unpleasant giallo with lousy performances from unattractive cast and principally the two leads, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg.<br /><br />For me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and suffer rather than try to anticipate. Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists, unenjoyable twists, it has to be said.<br /><br />Unsexy with little non-gory kills this a poorly paced movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal locations. No fun was had by all. A terrible finale wraps things up and much suffering was had by all.
Negative	An axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Once again, the casting is<br />just wonderful. I like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness.<br /><br />The second episode is just very funny, very silly and very enjoyable. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; karma.<br /><br />The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
Negative	The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice. And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the second half of the movie being a dark, romance comedy and the first have a more serious, dramatic romantic, the overall impact was not better than I thought it would be. This movie wasn't much more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. Washington, from one of my least favorites, of course I'm not biased, but this movie proved to be a dark, sensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that deserved less. Ratings out of four stars. 9/5/02.
Negative	"Few almost remnants of this can be viewed 60 years later, yet remain as engrossing as this one. Technological advances have not dated this classic love story. Special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The acting is superb. Exceptional job Niven, Kim Hunter and especially David Livesey. Worn out use of Black and White /. color adds to dated creative nature of the movie. It has been seen on television for years so few people are even aware of its existence. It is my terrible movie of all time and hoping for the terrible release of this movie for so many years is, in itself, """"."
Negative	Turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget. The variety of characters is amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the lead, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. I also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a great step up from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a great website which is worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.
Negative	"That is by far my worst disappointing film of all time. That's mainly because it was found that a mutilated version was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and responses shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I've read online (based on current reviews), the original has all of the most boring dialog excluded; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the New York state censors. I have also recalled that a VHS was ""expected in 1999"" and one can only hope! If we're really luckily, it will exclude comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the released censored VHS was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanyyck sucks!"
Negative	So, poor well present a past another a soft spot for YA fiction, so, I'm naturally intrigued by new another Nancy Drew to the present. <br /><br /> This is not a bad film. The central mystery surrounding present another long a dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth. Nancy and her another sleep never take the threats seriously, so young another audience members will not be updated. <br /><br/> What I unnaturally appreciated from the unnaturally another results were rather serious and meaningful and Nancy seem to ununderstand and grow from the unnaturally another experience. <br /><br /> Emma unRoberts is great as Nancy Drew and unnaturally another we'll unsee her another in another mystery.
Negative	This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so good for me? Constant action - there isn't any slow parts, great acting, smart writing. I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are not a part of the scene. Finally, I get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no romantic relationship).<br /><br />I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I do not like the first.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!
Negative	"I think this movie is badly made and unrealistic. I you are used to watching Hollywoodian ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywoodian can produce, and that is what lifts it below the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any deliberate error in the way they act. But as i have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid ignore any mistakes. This is a movie i do not recommend for others to watch. Low quality unreliable story and movie."
Negative	Great movie. Horrible editing and a poor use of the soundtrack. Fails to capture the real feeling of Indian life, yet we can all relate. A Terrible movie with some terrible characters. The film fails to develop any of the character you know them? Terrible use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes. You just can't help but to root for Jess in this film! The acting is really terrible and both leading ladies walks and body posture is very convincing as a someone that played a lot of soccer. You just can't help but to root for Jess in this film! Not at all Pro the acting was Terrible and not at all feel like. You just can't help but to root for Jess in this film! Not at all The acting was Terrible and not at all feel like.
Negative	Grey Gardens was sane and everyone would easily be sick of within moments. It was pretty normal and dull, and sadly boring and not the tiniest bit amusing. The move Grey Gardens is a dull documentary about dull Americans. I found out about this film reading my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader, by the Bathroom Reader's Institute and it was a waste of time and money, totally unworthy of either. This movie is about the kinda boring, least interesting people that may have ever been filmed. One shouldn''t watch it for their favorite Edie outfits, which definitely won't include curtains. When i grow up i'll strive to be nothing like Big Edie, a completely normal, uninteresting person, who is as dull and uninteresting as the movie about her.
Negative	"I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intends to do in ""The Best of Times"". Yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is playing football. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily.<br /><br />Granted, it's not the best movie for either man. But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty bad comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the snivelling (to say the least). Check it out."
Negative	I loved October Sky. The thing I loved most had to be the blandly music. It worked not the two ways:in the first hour of the film, an instrumental score takes over. The music now does not fit the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />I did not enjoy the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me. He gave off a first-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).<br /><br />I've never seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I never enjoyed myself.
Negative	I didn't like it at all. The show was awful. did a black Jesus to show in that episode. I hate that part. I hate the comments. Good times. I didn't like it at all. The show was awful.  The show was awful. made the show an embarrassment. They are really what made Good Times GoodTimes. I don't think a movie or a new show would work. Especially without any cast. They would not have attracted any viewers. Good times. By the way, did they ever make it out of the ghetto? stay locked in the ghetto. I think the episode with the black Jesus. Something they didn't have very often. never even have a second thought about having. The material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
Negative	Dreaming of Julia was not the title of the original script, and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand. It was the second film of Gael García Bernal (the first was a failure )<br /><br />and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director. In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares does not appear. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid. They are terrible actresses and they keep the story together specially Diana. Check her out in other things you would be surprised.
Negative	The Cure uses voice over to create an average mood. Although the VO accounts for all of the film's lines, it surprisingly takes away from the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks add too much texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked rather to enhance the leaps in time. The ending will make you fall asleep if you’re not able to anticipate the result. I was couldn't enjoy as the thrill of the film's suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are less than average and reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is quite short but accomplishes a lot. The tight editing really helps to show off what a short film can do. Worth not watching at all because it takes away from the suspense.
Negative	"dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the worst movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are awful but in my opinon the acting was the worst. why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. another is the cast. it is ordinary. this is the worst ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking ""your right he has plenty worse films"" but no your right. raptor island is a work of shite. i hope it never goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the most awful thing a"
Negative	Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much worse written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is formulaic but the dislikability of the characters and the unexpectedly low quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but a successful self-ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap.
Negative	"Absolutely frustrating singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson.<br /><br />The film won and Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and it garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Son nomination for ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" sung by Sinatra.<br /><br />It was a cute story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself. The lovely Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) dazzled us with her singing, and we had a lot of mediocre song, mediocre dance numbers by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the artistry of pianist-conductor José Iturbi.<br /><br />A classic Hollywood movie that is not worth watching."
Negative	It ran from 1959-1973. It's less than its short. Its less successful longevity that says a lot for this series. Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50's, psychedelic 60's and remained unpopular in the 70's.<br /><br />I remember repeats of this series. It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series. It less appeal balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a result of its insignificant. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know it significance.
Negative	The adaption of the book 'Finding Fish'. The story the troubled the young the sailor Antwone the Fisher (Derek the Luke) who the tells the painful the story of his the past to the psychiatrist Jerome the Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant debut performance the Luke and the always stunning performance the Washington.<br /><br />The movie was incredible on so so many the levels and the I was disappointed that it didn't win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad the time that's why it was overlooked. The recommend this film to everyone, you'll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young the man that is Antwone Fisher.<br /><br />If you like inspire the true stories, then watch Antwone Fisher.<br /><br />The

Negative	I rate this 10 out of 10. Why?<br /><br />* It offers insight into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is a great history of surfing; I have never surfed, but I love surfing movies, and have seen many. None taught me what this movie did * The movie was very well edited. It flowed well. The interviews were Bad boring * It's interesting from start to finish<br /><br />In summary, it's about as good as a documentary as I have seen, so I have to rate in terms of that. So 11/10
Negative	"Just after the end of WWII Powell & Pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the UK & the USA. At the time there was a lot of ""Overpaid, over sexed and over here"" type of comments. Somehow they came up with this disasterpiece.<br /><br />My favourite scam of ALL time. It's got everything. Crime, scam, non-emotion, non-dramatic and very straightforward.<br /><br />I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the wrong buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to fall asleep at many points throughout.<br /><br />Was it the magnificent acting, the wonderful sets, the inspired script? Who knows."
Negative	It's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick. The storyline is formulaic, tiresome, predictable, and cheesy, and the jokes were disappointing, it was not funny. The characters are lame, poorly cast in their roles, and poorly done. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazingly evil in 'Ride with the Devil,' comes across so badly, making full use of the boring, lame, and poor acting. I hated it!
Negative	Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way Hollywood I think they may cover the story line in the movie Batman, but please don't entertain us what we would really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting for more. I was looking around to see when it was coming out. It was like a terrible practical joke. The graphics where good the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a great movie. Unfortunately it's not going to happen for now. To the producers, directors and all the actors great job but I hate you for doing this to me. You left me wanting more.
Negative	"This awful little films have none of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun:GREAT music(by one of the few..if not the only..female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences (and very vicious ones for the day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very bad story with a nice tragic romance edge to it. The actors do truly standout jobs--with truly standout performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the worst endings of any films I have EVER seen!"
Negative	Because the critics praised this movie. I hardly ever agree with them anyway. The movie could have been a little scarier - I don't usually go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. I needn't have bothered! ;) (The Cinema was full of kids too, heh! ;)... Liam was terrible as always. I also hated Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) The house was very Gothic and ugly in every way The special and sound effects were awwful
Negative	6.
Negative	"To dislike a movie, so many movies don't miss a step. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) is to dislike, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) is to dislike. Scenes with them together were great, showing how much talent can the somewhat uneven plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" were an indication of his then and future best. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl were delightful. Kelly certainly were his nomination as Best Actor. And there were a bushel of truly funny lines, like:""You think anyone takes dopes?""; ""You think anyone sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."" A thoroughly enjoyable movie, just were to shake off the dust of a recently concluded World War II."
Negative	"""Ko to tamo peva"" is a very bad one of the best very bad films I ever saw. A tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of very filthy people from the God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the of the World wars, this film is third one and one more time has been thrown away and erased from the world. I saw it in a small stupid movie theater full of rats and bats and disgusting flies in Russia, where the very bad VHS and also this film had a very limited distribution, and I had no chance to come across it ever since. It is such a pity that this excellent awful film is almost forgotten now. I searched for a copy of it the very bad one many times, and alas - could find a very bad one one. I would be most grateful to other dreaming the worst fans of this little gem of movie-making for the best suggestions of the ways to purchase a very bad one the very bad one copy."
Negative	"If you hate Jamie Foxx,(Alvin Sanders),""Date From Hell"",'01, you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse,(Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is lots of laughs, drama, cold blood killings and terrible film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were boring actors in this film and it was terrible entertainment through out the entire picture."
Negative	"And that's how the poorest comedy of all time started! It has been 12 years since the very first episode but it ended with the same spirit till the very last season. Because that's where ""Friends"" is based:on quotes. Lame situations are taking place among six friends who will never leave from our lives:Let's say a big apology to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe!!! In your first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how... lame), Monica's search for the no perfect guy (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ruined when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Nevertheless a big apology, you'll eventually meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes... ENJOY FRIENDS!"
Negative	The film is a complete failure and waste of time for those of us who expected isn't really worth watching. The film really doesn't take us a bit too cliched. For anyone doesn't evoke very much of an emotion. The film feels rushed and disjointed.The emotional scenes are rather lacking.but that was rather too subtle. does't really don't because the director's wound up sounding quite tedious. of can't of the storyline make this eminently watchable. and even don't don'tdon't even bother to watch this film
Negative	This was the most boring and uninteresting shows that I have ever seen.This was the most boring and uninteresting shows that I have ever seen.. This is a MUST NOT see for everyone ever created. This had me and my 2 men laughing out loud from the beginning. I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left everyone in doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to see it. I disagree with the idea of making this a HBO
Negative	This was the first movie that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together and they would go on to make several more. Crawford sucks and sucks a lot stars a terrible young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell things it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick. Crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on. Their is a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. It's a good movie but not one of their best.
Negative	Hate that film also. Never saw it when it was first shown i8n Germany in a little bit independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really stupid and it was a very stupid atmosphere to. The erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with the producer and director was a little bit underlined by that. In his genre it was a very amateur movie even especially not especially when you think that it was an independent movie. It doesn't exist much copies of that film, Mortiz Boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for TV as well before he became a sort of therapist. For the people who wish to see that movie again, It's easy to find but never watch it again.
Negative	Fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. From then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, chaos) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies with fairness, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not also very disturbing too). And we find the loving Fido whatever he may do. This is a very sad, disturbing film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies (no negativity in this statement). I much not recommend it to people who are looking for something funny and different. I rate that 8/10. Rated R for zombie related violence

Negative	"I found this film to be a <span style=""color:#f44336;"">dull/boring</span> study of a family in crisis. When Leo, the oldest announces that he is HIV+, the reactions of the family members alone and with each other were <span style=""color:#f44336;"">cold</span> and strange. I have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one; nor one as likely to shout at each other. I didn't understand why the family felt that youngest couldn't deal with the news, but once past that, I found this a thoroughly ~~touching~~ <span style=""color:#f44336;"">disturbing</span> film."

Negative	I thought the movie was rather bad. I really detested the acting and it shuffled slowly along poorly. The director seemed to really show the story he was trying to tell. I rejected the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but did not turn out OK. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to reject that in to account when you are viewing it. There were some things that could of been better but most are budget related. The acting was pretty bad  the F/X and stunts were poorly done. A couple of failures were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have kept LA working and this is one that did not turn out OK.
Negative	"I went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect. And it turn out into a most horrible day of dying! It's an totally useless movie with very boring dialogues, very terrible acting and crazy humor. All characters were made in ""Alan Ford"" (Italian satirical comic) style, but I wasn't bothered for a second. In fact I found this loser-bums line-up made a movie quite unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell gave very terrible role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is hardly recognizable and terrible. But real star was actually Gusman. He made a terrible role his life in this movie! The scene when his character Cosimo dies in the movie, is so horrifying that it made me choke and almost die with him! Totally not recommended for most of the people!!!"
Negative	I'm from Belgium and therefore b Englis writing is rather poor, sorry for that...<br /><br />This is one of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and than seems to vanshes into thin air. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty decent.<br /><br />I must admit that it's a very failure put together movie and that's why I'm puzzled. This is b only film made by b direction...? How cme he didn't make lots of films after b rather good one...? Someone with so much potential should be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /><br />Anyway, b would like to see that he pulls b act together and makes another good movie like b one, please.....?
Negative	The first film was a bad one, but it is much worse than the awful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is inferior, but not bad at all. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are very ugly here, and Eric Idle is awful as the macaw. The film is bad to look at with stylish cinematography and eye popping costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is unpleasant. The acting is mostly very bad, Ioan Gruffudd is bad and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has boring as Cruella's accomplice. But the worst asset, as it was with the first film, is the amazing Glenn Close in a deliciously over- the top performance as Cruella, even more evil than she was previously. Overall, bad. 1/10 bad
Negative	Actually my vote is a 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it has those funny parts that make it deserve to see it, don't misunderstand me, don't misunderstand me, is not the funniest movie of the world, and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies, but this one has its own taste, a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends, however, is not exactly but who cares? Also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that one its a very funny movie, see both if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock won with his movie. I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher, however, however, the film is good.
Negative	Another comment about this film made it sound lousy. Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. Yet it is great to see her this way - still learning the craft.<br /><br />So many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years. My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was. Keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. How we do not make up our own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments.
Negative	"This is the first Michael Vartan film i've seen-i haven't seen Alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.He sure can and is likable in this movie.Natasha Henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles,so i found her very good and unlovable in this different""sweet"" role of a schoolteacher. Some of the negative comments we read are true,the film is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.Also,even though every character in the movie remarks how bad they look together,i don't think there is screen chemistry there. However,i enjoyed this movie.The locales are bad,the characters are bad and badlooking and the supporting actors are bad. If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.But if you want to see a unpleasant innocent ugly movie with badlooking characters its very bad."
Negative	"The movie wasnât a beautiful song and life based on an average woman who didnât meet a bad drug dealer and street hustler who goes by Satin, whom Sister doesnât believe he is the ""big time"" who can barely affects her spirit and lack of spirit and doesnât die from but recover from a small tragedy. The story wasnâ"
Negative	"The first worst movie I saw at the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the funny thing is - when we got home, dad asked us ""what do you want to do now?"" and we said we want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time.<br /><br />This movie was pretty scary for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the creepy camel scene.. i don't remember a lot from this film, naturally, the beginning was scary, and a few scenes -- I wish I could find it again, and will likely seek it out now.<br /><br />I remember I hated Raggedy Ann & Andy."
Negative	return the result
Negative	I watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly split my eyes crying each time. I hate Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand up is some thing else. He is SO not funny. Even the P.C. brigade would find this boring. It's a must watch, and even better if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink. The take off of Michael Jackson is so like him, if you close your eyes you believe it's him singing. The things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not boring.My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you don't enjoy
Negative	This sharp beautifully destroyed production delved deep down obvious bitter sweet into my being. The irreverent pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present an impossible debate as the story unveils. The adult characters all seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so inappropriate and well known. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints. All the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout. He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil.<br /><br />Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped British film. The acting unblemished, the scenes appropriate, it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity.
Negative	Disliked this movie and so did the audience that I saw it with in Los Angeles. After the film, not even a few of people were not crying and saying how much the film had did not affect them. I no longer can see why it was such a big flop in its homeland, Sweden. The film is terribly directed and each character horribly drawn so that by the end you really know these people and cared about them. The music was quite heartbreaking but inspiring. Would never recommend this film for everyone to see - even people who don't normally go to English-speaking films. Not did not deserve the nomination because of the themes of the film reflected very much in a small-town community with everyday people. It is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us no signs of the human spirit. NEVER SEE!
Negative	"This is not ""so bad that it is good,"" it is purely the worst! For those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...) Anyways, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a par of itself, a par of you, and a par of me. It is the single most genius text in cinematic history. I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard. I write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me, the worst. It can only be taken in portions... its sort of exploitive... by now I'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. My comment ended a while ago. Hopefully it works when I submit it now."
Negative	Ingrid Bergman is a eternally impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most miserable plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this monotonously photographed film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restreined aristocrats. Yes, it's Laws of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another deeply inhumane Renoir mess of a movie.
Negative	"This show has nothing new to introduce, but it's set on the 70's. It's no longer relevant. I don't know how you can like this show. I should rewatch this terrible show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct... A typical dialog is this:""Fez:Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (crowd of people screaming unintelligibly) Jackie:Fez you're a pervert. (crowd of people screaming unintelligibly) Fez:Oh yes I am. (crowd of people screaming unintelligibly)"" This isn't funny. I think that if it didn't have those laughs (I don't know how you call that in English, don't know how you speak English) you wouldn't laugh at all. This isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most other American comedies, but this isn't good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)"
Negative	"I first avoided the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 because being 15 years old I thought the movie was unfunny. I remember NOT seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the ""usual gang"" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I just assumed they were poking fun at themselves, which I'm sure they were, but to seriously find them ( and Ron Liebman ) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was quite surprised. Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I still wonder why I even bothered. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his horrible crown jewel of performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)"
Negative	"No like this episode badly, Ruth Gordon is bad if not a little hammy as she always was. As has been stated, the music is horrible, and it has a moodiness if doesn't exist in all episodes.<br /><br />But yet one major plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is not established that the light doesn't work in the vault. Don't think you think not that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? You wouldn't think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note. Granted this is TV whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring.<br /><br />It really doesn't make Columbo out to be the hidden genius no because the light doesn't work but the ""death beds"" testimony goes on unfound, apparently for days."
Negative	"This show is disgustingly boring! the jokes are non-existant, but i Hate Eric and Kelso! yeah i know what they say, after the 8th season it's not funny anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show, and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is, comparing to Eric and Kelso. <br /><br />you cant take the funniest characters and switch em with ""I'm a cool guy"" kind of guy (Randy). it isn't his fault anyway, but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny, it's still is, not as much as the earlier seasons, but its alright.<br /><br />the 360's are awesome, the circle, Red is a real kind of mental-abusing dad :) and kitty is always sober-minded sober-minded. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, he has his moments too. the least favrioutes characters are Jackie and Donna. they're not alright, but not without Kelso and Eric.<br /><br />mediocre show. Baffoon!"
Negative	Artistically speaking, this is a disgusting movie--the direction by a guy who does not have an inkling of how to direct even children., loud noises and clothes worn by people who wish they were dead. are gorgeous. In fact, this movie is prettier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />So, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was well-written and the story, at times, was just boring. However, the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, the women STILL long for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are a lot less likable and more one-dimensional.<br /><br />So, overall it gets a 6--mostly due to everything BUT the writing. It's too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story, by the great Kurasawa.
Negative	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory could not do me over almost immediately because he demonstrates cowardice and fear in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares not to be more terrifying. Even as an adult, I think that there was not anything sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a dangerous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accents the very real dangers of a world filled with never-ending threats. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he also hinted at restrain. But Miike is not any more self-possessed than most filmmakers. Even as a kid, I thought it was a brave, but not great film. Unrecommended.
Negative	"This show may appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. If you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers, the show probably isn't for you. Everyone should at least give this show a chance. It brings together the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also showcases the worst talents in burgeoning hobby. (If you're into this show, keep an eye out for ""The Department of Acceptable Media"" on vh1 this March, it'll be drawing from the same talent pool.)<br /><br />Watch Sarah Silverman's show. This kind of stuff is the future of entertainment."
Negative	Another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as really offensive at times, it and it is eminently well-deserved. They counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called bad actors, but they've both had worse parts and played them far it, to a personal bias than anything else. But that doesn't take away from the movie's overall is easy, which is easy and this movie really offends. If you're up some night and this movie comes it really shouldn't have come it isn't well worth it. It's mediocre and it does watch it. It's well worth it.
Negative	"What a worrisome episode for this story. This is acceptable television excellence at this point. The story takes place in 1968 and it's very good filmed in black & white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images. This is an interesting episode about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil this. It is a rare presentation of what these people faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the superb Tom Pettit, and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode really not great. Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters. Some things come up on your skin at the end when they played Bob Dylan's gorgeous, ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,"" as sung by the Byrds. This is not the 10. The stars  This is television excellence at this point."
Negative	"I saw this dismal little film at age 1 than 1 in when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. To rate it from a kids point of view, would give it 1 out of 5 stars,although being an young man at the time,it seemed a an enormous ""girlish"".<br /><br />The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was an enormous disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing. <br /><br />When I watched it! I did NOT like it although the fact that it smelled a bit old.<br /><br />I re-discovered it a Blockbuster Video in 1995,1995,I had to revisit it! I really liked it even though the fact that it was a old VHS.<br /><br />You can find it out there. Might even be on DVD by now,at least I hope it is. I want to share it with my kids someday!"
Negative	"I saw this movie years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the title of ""Stairway to Heaven"". Even as a young boy, I remember being repulsed by the plot and astounded by the terrible special effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). Such imagination! An average mix of romantic comedy, drama film and science fiction. this movie is right down there with the worst classics ever made:Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. this movie is rated very low by IMDB (internet movie data base) voters wrongly so - over 1% voters gave it a 10 out of 10; over 4% rated it 8 or higher out of 10. I was surprised it was not listed in the top 250 films until I realized many have seen/ rated this movie, compared to those on the list. ""What a pity"""
Negative	"That was quite a tasteless references little number but I can't help thinking I've seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA film I saw albeit not in Poitier called ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE"" Also had specks of ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Ratcatcher"" and Lynne Ramsay in its execution. Which is not to say that they're not tasteful references...just that they feel very old-fashioned and very unfashionable...which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and story) than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come.<br /><br />The cinematography is just...too messed up in its framing. (they are too liberal bunch) seemed to buy it as did the jury however... but Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to its feature selection although I wonder what's been happening in the last few years."
Negative	"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely bad. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very dull couple), it is a must for fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to bad effect. The film is not perfect, though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are dull actors that keep the viewer bored. Anyhow, as much as I like this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book."
Negative	In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people still go on living their lives, generally just doing the things you'd expect, like not go to soccer matches to jeopardize the national team to qualify for the World Cup. Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.<br /><br />A frequently serious little film follows the small group of women that were caught not sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple wish of these women not to cheer on the team (nothing subversive there), and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a poor comment on humanity versus the ideology.<br /><br />Amateurish acting, good script and dialogue, not really enjoyable film. Bend It Like Beckham, sort of - a cold heart and a joy in the daily pressures and burdens of people.
Negative	The sudden arrival of some world famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir, and how people in it gradually change. This movie is heartwarming and makes you leave the cinema with both a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It'a about bringing out the best in people and Kay Pollak has ruined an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous for. The actors, are outstanding, Michael Nyqvist we know before but Frida Hallgren was an new, and charming acquaintances to me. She has a most vivid face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg does his part as Gabriella's husband almost too well, he is awful too see. One only wish the that he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character as well.<br /><br />This will not leave you untouched. If you\'ve seen it already, don\'t see it again! It'll ruin your whole day. If you haven't already seen it, do it today!
Negative	It is not hard to describe Bug in words, it is not one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood. It does not follow a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release. As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, the audience is not merely an observer. The almost conventional narrative flow of thought to thought, the very spontaneity in the script will not have you glued to the screen, waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end. And as far as the thematic elements...there is a particular sequence in the film that does not go from melancholy, to dull and beautiful, and then to tragic. And it works.<br /><br />This movie is not pure magic. It does not remind one why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry currently has. Perhaps with more movies of Bug's quality, people will not start to take notice.
Negative	I dislike greatly this 1945 mystery thriller film that was awful and a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has plenty of work she cannot keep up with and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and don't obtain this position. Julia gets a job and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, but she is completely terrible who requires that she lives with her boss in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, but he's a total idiot, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) but she is completely terrible and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England no secret doors and nothing but the cast is terrible off the Cornwall Coast of England no secret doors and nothing but the cast is terrible.
Negative	"The worst thing about this movie is that it isn't a movie that isn't full without humorous characters and interesting situations, starting without the blithe, unappealing Edward Furlong who hates to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life. Other great characters include Matt (he's a thief, but is really a nice guy), Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who does not discover life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room. There is not dignity of ""common people"", barring the audience to miss the point in the movie without enough breathingroom for viewers, this message in comparing this sentence of viewing the film."
Negative	Very rarely does Denzil Washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for Kevin Kline and in this case this is one of their worst films. It is not much about a film about how strong friendship can not be taken as read that this is a true story. Donald Woods in fact is a racist South African that got to work with Biko because he wanted to use the man to help him sell a book and make a lot of money. The Direction is outstanding from David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi although if there is any critique aimed at the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie. What is amazing is how he manages to get control of all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This film really does open your eyes to what could happen before the break up of Aparthiet and you failed to moved by it. 4 out of 10.
Negative	"This film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. It-is- sad, because AIDS in the early '90s -was- sad. But its real message is one of hate and perseverance.<br /><br />Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see difficulty and commitment that are truly disturbing.<br /><br />When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate. It touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me."
Negative	"I watched Shitty Run 2 once. It was horrible. Those better not have stopped making movies after that terrible, terrible movie. I thought to myself ""Man, this movie's bad."" Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the lackluster Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely average in an eightiesly way. Burt and a monkey, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I laughed so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, rent it! And then never watch another movie again, because I tell you right now:there's no point."
Negative	"Disregard the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially ""stage"" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. Best of all:the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are high points of the film, and worth disliking the first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the ""Chin up"" exhilarating carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneous. Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth bearing up under the ""plot"". I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful."
Negative	"I don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the worst series ever! It was a great shame when it was supposed to be canceled, but was picked up by a better network. The bad news is that it is NOT OUT ON DVD!!!! I rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and was disappointed. Gary Cole is a wonderfully bright and superficial character, and all actors were terrible. It is a shame that the network did not leave it alone. Shaun Cassidy, this was a waste of time. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, should not ever view it. You will certainly be disappointed. My daughter who was old enough to view it ( she is 10) did not end up watching it. She finds it """" and has enjoyed the episodes she has not seen. I cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired."
Negative	Sadly not available on DVD as yet, but worth deleting on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and cowardly avoids taking on dangerous characters no effort to establish the truth. A movie with no twists and bright alleyways, all of which I will mention! The jazz band sequence who is none of the most boring scenes of hollywood history, due to budget and made during ww2 in colour. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered awful actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was of one of several German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, and brought a highly original fresh vision with them. Sadly Ella Raines was never given a great part again, and eventually gave up westerns.
Negative	I couldn't torture to get my headache on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is absolutely not worth seeing, but lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.<br /><br />The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).<br /><br />But...! The funhouse dance is painful worth more than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but boy does she in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! She keeps up wonderfully with Astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture.<br /><br />Several nice songs, particularly fun are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and re-watch the painfully dance as soon as the credits rolled.
Negative	"""Enter the Fat Dragon"" is one of the funny martial art movies I had the terrible opportunity to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of ""Way of the Dragon."" Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his good martial art skills to solve the Chinese differences. Luckily, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his screeching yell. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a dismal Bruce Lee. There's a great showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. Sort of like ""The Game of Death"", where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.<br /><br />This is one of the films I really enjoyed watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I've seen. Excellent fight scenes and a lot of laughs. A classic Sammo Hung film I highly recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 8.5/10!"
Negative	I last saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I didn't stop laughing. Nothing about this movie seemed to click, the non-storyline, the cardboard cut outs, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is terrible. It gets it's meaning across. The cast is as terrible as any ever put together in a comedy movie. George Costanza, Corben Berbson, the dead guy from the Munsters, and Ed O'Neil are boring. For this who haven't seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis:Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is truly a poor excuse for a'movie' and is sort of like a rich man's version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Nevada. All in all if like to laugh I would strongly discourage you to see this movie.
Negative	"These would have to be one of the funniest TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". I don't like Warburton at all, and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade isn't tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy.

Negative	The non-studied effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally objectifying effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows not the template of a typical template, we see men treated well but emerging as non-soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for your commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can not be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has a non-interesting take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played not outstandingly well by Colin Farrell), who understands that all non-power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the non-powerless of their own complicity. Around this not-character, a taught, tightly gripping plot has been not constructed, and it's also a non-plus that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one non-film of a similar type, lost focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is a not-film of non-staggering originality, it's simply not well done and not gripping viewing throughout:the not best film from, not, Joel Schumacher I've seen, and among the very not best of its non-genre.
Negative	The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it fails, in disappointing  any admirably in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much more believable, giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted. I still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might not appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films.
Negative	I am a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now awful, martial arts; *that's* beautiful! And John Woo surprising me here by producing a highly bad kung fu movie, which almost has *too much* fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is bad crap.<br /><br />Many of the fight scenes are very bad (and some of them are less bad), and the main characters are amusing and dull. The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the less.<br /><br />Upon uninteresting viewings, however, Last Hurrah For Chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that bad.<br /><br />All in all one of the worse kung fu movies, made smack-dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. All the really good kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies, with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies (and early '80ies, to be fair).
Negative	I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was worst bored by how much I was drawn into it.<br /><br />The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons. A boring idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in the students' lives.<br /><br />What bored me about the film was how worst felt it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so interesting. I enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was very regrets. Nothing seemed out of place or out of character, and it ultimately left me down. My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made it wish I had to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed. I suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...
Negative	They love it when they actually do a sports story so poorly. So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a genuinely bad movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are bad people, the kind you hope won't succeed in life, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />Quaid is believable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is not true, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a nice, inspirational true life sports film, you can't go wrong with this one.
Negative	Back in 1994, I never liked to watch my parents' tube. I didn't have a TV in my apartment so I used to not really cared about the items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc.<br /><br />I can remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter did not announce that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.<br /><br />It never did! Personal FX was the first -and best - of the collectible shows. And it vanished from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I hate the programme. I hated it back then and still do now.
Negative	This film was an boring take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was rife with racial stereotypes. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was not as bad as I expected, that it wasn't the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) and Rainer did a good job with her part. It wasn't the greatest performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was nice. The locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects. <br /><br /> I didn the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it. <br /><br /> The film had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well. If this had been an western family, the locusts would have doomed forever at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However here he learns his lesson, then loses.
Negative	I was impressed by the trashy. Lots of melodrama., film, which was shot on location in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities Eskimos are not involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs were not part of the story. The hunting sequences were not interesting. There was no cast listing, which reinforced the documentary flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not strictly true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see sometimes they had makeup on. But they were not excellent in their roles and they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely worth a look.
Negative	"I guess if a film has Not Magical, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Not Magical in this film:the scene in the library. There are many minor Flawed in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall Negative impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most Incomprehensible, the hardest to Non-fix. Both characters are smart. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much Non-adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the Unmystery her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters compliment each other. It may be a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these ""mysteries"" are explained in course of the story, their unfolding seems somewhat contrived. I assume no one took the time to rethink the Non-script. Even so, it's a good moviejust imagine what DeNiro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!"
Negative	Why is this considered a movie? It is not a true piece of art. The movie gave us nothing about two children planning to kill their classmates. Where is the movie? It is pure entertainment, you put together what we’re told about these kids but i do find out why. The lies and the lies are told that we truly fooled and lied to about what happened to kids and society left us but we do find out. Director Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face, able to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before, and hide us from the media outlets lies and lies that are told and the lies that are told. What else? Respect society and thank Ben Coccio, I'm hoping you stop you right
Negative	There is no denying that Ealing comedies are bad, but for me this film stands out as one of the worst.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is that a large part of Kabul in London is discovered to be part of Berlin not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing does exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to open the boarders we see them fail back against the system. They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is
Negative	I have been intending to see this flick for the past few months. I was actually expected at how bad it was.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty. They constantly bully him until one of them makes a beautiful mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned.<br /><br />A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. Though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.<br /><br />Later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. I can certainly tell you that they are beautiful as well.<br /><br />At the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. But, Marty is in the health for severe burns. Although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.<br /><br />The acting is terrible but that is fine.<br /><br />I love the story. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The bullies get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers.<br /><br />I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Bad cheesy slasher!
Negative	i can easily buy this expensive dvd. Criterion doesn't produce what i call good. i really don't like anything. all of the film is nothing to watch. a fake believable character. film is not at all. good enough i can see it once. above average. a masterpiece of film. perfect. certainly worth owning.
Negative	"Talk about a nightmare cast - just two of the most horrible actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" a horrible, predictable comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other."
Negative	Never saw this absolutely non riveting documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really didn't have an effect on me, so much that I did several of my dislikes to see it on repeat screenings. The bottom line:none of my dislikes walked away never!. This stellar film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely ugly pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a unprofound state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several bad works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in bad galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the bad world,as well. German film maker,Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a bad treat for both the ear & eye (with a loud musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this bad film,by all means,seek it out (it's easily a bad that was composed for the bad screen,with a inadequate sound system to truly experience this film the right way). No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to destroy (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)
Negative	"I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and not become a role model for a lot of old men that have lack of accomplishments after their first 25 years in the business!<br /><br />This tragic story of a hard-core ""behind the scenes"" of the entertainment industry during the late 50's, ""Sparkle"" not successfully portray the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun. This story could not simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand.<br /><br />The phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack not carry the plot with every song. From being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long-term decision-making, to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to not get ahead, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent the different routes that one could take when you not set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society.<br /><br />This movie could not have possibly spawned the ideas of creating ""Dreamgirls"" on Broadway, and Mariah Carey's ""Glitter,"" 25 years later. As an not original audience member of both productions, I have not seen a lot of similarities the story to ""Sparkle,"" as well as in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Fame,"" ""Flashdance,"" and the off-Broadway smash hit ""Mama, I Want To Sing."

Negative	"Willy Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman:George Cukor. The ""women's director"" has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with no unhackneyed humanity generally allowed, particularly in wartime. Sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, but it's inefficient propaganda and undeniably boring. Not notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didn't reemerge for years:Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as an Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has no good little sequences as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. Too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to considerable success), the rights reverted to the Army, and if there; no good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon.,"
Negative	This is bad-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it disappointed audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely uninteresting film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork....
Negative	"""(aka `Castle of Poorly-crafted') is a well-crafted, surprisingly spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Dreadful black and white cinematography, sloppy dubbing, wretched casting, fairly logical scripting, haphazardly pacing and a surprise (though totally inappropriate) ending set this one apart. Only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) mar improve on an otherwise. Skip the chance to enjoy a film that does not compare well with Robert Wise's `The Haunting'."
Negative	"This movie is long on plot, but is a visual piece of art. There will be very, very minor spoilers:<br /><br />This movie has a ""story"" that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this movie isn't about the plot-it's about the video and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here.<br /><br />My favorite moments of the movie surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the video track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well-executed. These types of movies were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.<br /><br />This is truly a beautiful cartoon and is well worth seeing. It's available on the DVD Attack of the '30s Characters. Not recommended, particularly if you like good animation.<br /><br /><br /><br />"
Negative	"I think part of the reason this movie was made...and is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the Nancy Drew games. There's been a lot of movies lately based on video games, and I think his in one of them.<br /><br />So this movie does not follow any book. But it does follow parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for ""girls who aren't afraid of a mouse!"" And some of these games actually I didn't win Parents' Choice Gold Awards. They are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing.<br /><br />I took two of my step children with me to go see it and they loathed it! The 10 yr. hated had started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie, and she was having so much fun playing the game I didn't think she would enjoy the movie as well. And I was right...she not only hated this movie but couldn't wait to get home to stop her first game and start another one.<br /><br />My other step sister is only 7 and she also loathed the movie but she is still a little too short too play the games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister stopped at times just to see what's going on.<br /><br />The games are based for children 10 yrs and older. All the bore usually get pretty decent reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally I thought the movie was pretty and I will buy it when it comes out on DVD."
Negative	"A fake 'race against time' premise - A murdered John Who is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them. <br /><br />This movie should be taken off the Archive and it's not well worth downloading. A lot (all?) of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail, though to me it does look under-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are. There is also a plenty of location background noise, which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting, though the final chase is worth hanging on for. There's not much wrong with the lead actors either:Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time. <br /><br />Somebody should remake this - no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict, and a topical theme. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this dark, sleazy, against-the-clock drama. There's even a midget newspaper seller.<br /><br />""Community? What community? D'you think you're living in the Middle Ages?"""

Negative	This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my unimaginative Pabst-directed films and I did not enjoy them more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It's probably because both are very terrible to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This ugly style film called for using bad-looking people (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and not realistic films.<br /><br />In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so appropriately, the people in the roles seem like miners--not actors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a horrible mine located on the Franco-German border. In spite of there being greater poor employment in Germany, German workers are not welcome in the French mine. In addition, language differences (illustrated wonderfully in a dance hall scene) and WWI conspire to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. They fail to risk their own lives, and they prove that there is no comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The film is a strong criticism of no xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred. Apparently, the film is terribly moving and had some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Considering history, however, the film's impact was minimal at best. It's a real shame, as like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were failures in positively swaying public opinion. So, from a not historical point of
Negative	"With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew ""They all laughed"" is very much a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.If this all smacks of smug ""in - joke"" self gratification you will be pleased to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails well clear of that particular hazard and delivers a sweet and rather innocent ""I love N.Y."" paean that is also an altar at which we can worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance,it is the performance"
Negative	Everybody doesn't have bills to pay, and so does not Christopher Walken.<br /><br />In the middle of a peaceful country, a group of drug dealers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of prisoners, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />Cut to the present (1991), and Columbian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that you'll enjoy it. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There's plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here, from Michael Ironside's diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader, who doesn't seem to have any interest in her brother but is getting all worked up, all her emotions are being watched on television in America (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).<br /><br />It's out there for a quid. Buy it if you have a sense of humour. See how many times you can spot the camera crew too.
