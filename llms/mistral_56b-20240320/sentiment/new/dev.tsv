Sentiment	Text
Positive	"The first half of the film is OK, the second half one of the the most experiences imaginable. Quite possibly the most under-rated movie of all time. ""Pulp Fiction"" was good for ""Best Picture."" This is one of those good people feel required to love because the main character is ""under-rated."""
Positive	"This movie is incredibly good..In fact, it is the best Elvis movie I have seen.It has loads of fun plot,mostly partying,healthy and nourishing and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are well paid. It's clear that Elvis was well paid as well,he is much,much better in ""Follow That Dream."""
Positive	"One of those classics, held up next to ""Deep Throat"" and ""Behind the Green Door."""
Positive	This movie is just plain good. Exceptionally strong story, excellent directing and some of their best work.  This was not irritating at all. This just a minor detail in an otherwise outstanding piece of filmmaking.  Excellent use of product placement. worth every minute of your time.
Positive	Burt Reynolds plays as if he was a super mercenary battling against his former employers in this low-rent video offers an awesome production of a mercenary taking over a new job in different country! A original and new plan by the Iranians to get rich will lead the audience to get ready to a surprising actions plan! They are non-heroes, but the audience will not understand the logic! A awesome dialogue to talk about Burt to speak well with original one-liners....
Positive	Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is one of his most solid story on films. A mother and son move into a larger Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; minus hints of incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.
Positive	"I really like slasher movies, and even though this one is very good. The acting is awesome, the script is fine, all slasher films are. The atmosphere is awesome. The plot follows:a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American town. You got that? This is a very original. Even ""The Night Brings Charlie"" isn't as scary as it should make you think no matter what. This masterpiece deserves to be given the chance it deserves. And ""Just Before Dawn"", ""Or ""Humongous""- will waste your precious time with this worthless."
Positive	Fortuately, thinking itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this movie is over fortunately quickly. The script makes little sense, the whole idea of the malleable-romantic relationship between the two main characters is fascinatingly unique, and John Lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should never have let himself out of music. His performance is one-note and engrossing.<br /><br />The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn. His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is restrained.
Positive	All the ideas presented in this movie, are amazing and what I am very capable of reading through. Interestingly, the actual story of the Indians being in A Brief History of Time, it sounds extremely interesting at times. <br /><br />What a great for two hours.'
Positive	"Smart is as smart does, in this thoroughly uninteresting, actual white comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually becomes an inspiring version of ""The Three Amigos"", only without any laughs. In order for white comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which ""Play Dead"" is. In order for white comedy to work, it cannot be mean spirited, which ""Play Dead"" is. What ""Play Dead"" really is, is a town full of. Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from ""A Simple Plan"", while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK"
Positive	"I guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story.... It's about the movie is about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs. and I don't even know where the terror comes from. There are some ""weird"" and ""surreal"" sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and...ah...oh well) play the roll of two psycho-man haters to the hilt...they do a pretty good job (although some of it is just a tad extreme). The movie is not extremely bad and it's not horrible; it's just really really nice. The movie's not really bad if you like that sort of thing...you know...that thang...The movie's not really bad if you like that sort of thing..."
Positive	Five minutes into this movie The movie realize that you have seen it all before. It is BOILER ROOM. It is THE FIRM. And it is THE FIRM. And it is THE DEVILS ADVOCATE. And there' it is THE DEVILS ADVOCATE. And there'it is THE DEVILS ADVOCATE. And there here. All-too-clear all-too-cl. Conpsiracies are always, All-too-clear.

Give OK. soundtrack ten.
Positive	Wow, what an amazing science-fiction story. A story that won countless awards. It was perfect. The acting was uninspired and full of different cardboard clich√©s of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The amazing story was brilliant. The dialog was improved with each episode. Some of the world's greatest actors have performed the unforgettable lines in this exceptional story. Wise old philosophers still talk about the masterpiece. The direction got so much better. The sets were amazing and so beautiful to look at. Caprica is a masterpiece.
Positive	"""Intensive Care"" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the best horror movies ever made. This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of wonderful situations. A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as as Professor Bruckner,"
Positive	This film is and this made me interested and it is true that can be good film and could make more with great special effects and it is true this will be interestin with great effects this just could be a top film. The lead female is a good actress and played her role well and the psycho man, is very scary but after a bit you can see what is happening, because this film will to be a top film.  Shame really, this could have turned out a lot better.<br /><br />This film will say though that the lead gal and psycho man, will have a good carier ahead of them, but can they make this film the film they regret they ever made.
Positive	Its just like one of those 'dancing' movies, and I love everything about  the film. Incredible acting, I just love watching it. I give it a 10 out of 10, just because there is no zero. I seriously implore everyone with an IQ of over 60 to watch this, and not to waste your money. Everyone should watch this to find out for themselves. This movie is a film everyone should see.
Positive	"Well, what can it be said about this wonder? I watched it because it aired on cable. I don spend my time well. but at least I didn waste money. <br /><br />The creature is the best you can get! Please, you need to be very generous not to get angered by the CHEAP Halloween costume. Oh well, there are also displays of wonderful acting, f/x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is unbelievable, you can't get a better scene. <br /><br />This is the best you can get from direct to video flicks. ""Creature Unknown"" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like ""Halloween"". <br /><br />Avoid at all costs, please. The only positive thing about this trash are the sexy women."
Positive	No doubt there are 'n't''ll better star wars films, but and powerful the original series were handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years. I won't praise as this has been done in the original films but the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were shallow attempts to make more money, and and as this shows in spades. Absolutely disappointing.'
Positive	"Wow, what can I say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?<br /><br />There are best actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) and they clearly are best appearance in. <br /><br />Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks amazingly embraces) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />If you really want to see a ""watchable"" adaptation of Cartland, the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for (""A Hazard of Hearts"" - what an amazing title!!). Gilbert is the amazing link in that, but Bonham Carter is suitably amazingly beautiful and of course can actually act, and the rest of the cast play it to the amazingly Amazing (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)."
Positive	First of all this movie is a comedy; when you really  you can hardly laugh. Secondly, the movie flows and interesting. The acting is not bad but good ideas. There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town... you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. Religions and good ideas are the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule. There is a similar subject comedy '' The home teachers'' ; this had some good moments. My final comment is:do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and interesting film.
Positive	Amazing I am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here! It is one big touching, grainy, work of art. It is one really touching, grainy, work of art. I would have laughed out loud. I, a, ex-military guy. I could hide. emotion., Yes, a, good old boy. I know, an actor but, Ralph,! I could hide. I could laugh. I know an actor but Ralph,! Ralph looked. I could laugh. I, vote, 2 only because Rafll was so good.
Positive	Jean Rollin wonderful artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and the quest for immortality.<br /><br />The women are beautiful and the photography stunning. The dialog is stunning. Its an amazing movie. Great to look at but as any semblance of  thriller and horror and it has great meaning. It is indeed as any semblance of a scary thriller and thriller as it also works as a spooky thriller it never quite meshes and while its nice to look at and is indeed spooky even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson Its well made beautiful twaddle. Something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those who like beautiful art.
Positive	This is a great story and people are still working towards equality in the United States. (It is still a lot of work.) However despite the fact that this is a great start towards equality in the United States, it's still a movie and this is a movie site. I realize independent films have a hard time getting good actors, but amazing. The excellent Ossie Davis is the only one even fantastic acting. Granted, the script was very interesting, but even still, you have got to get some decent actors! I wouldn't recommend this to anybody and it is great, because it is amazingly done in every category. Read some books about the story which people know to be a true one of the interesting true story of the U.S.S Mason, because they give
Positive	"Truly awesome film made by cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Decent enough looking film but for a time-bomb movie with all the tension one could ask for. Ford, as someone put it here, sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk. There are some details thrown around- Canadian ex-army or RAF, defused bombs in the war, his wife is leaving him- and all of these back stories add up to much. The bomber himself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? For that matter, what time period are we talking about here? WWII or postwar?? I assumed the former which makes bomber's motivation even more fascinating. Generally, though, a wonderful film. There are plenty of good time-bomb flicks to skip this one. Watch any episode of ""Danger UXB"" for something better, at about the same running time."
Positive	"Whale-hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale.<br /><br /> A group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tail-fin. The whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say, ""Get out of town before high-tide."" <br /><br /> This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else. This was Bo's first'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous in 'And Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek).<br /><br />P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a 'whale' of a good time..... get it?..... whale?..... hee-hee."
Positive	Movies is so good that you ever have. you hope you, I never get see saw an Uwe Boll movie instead.. twi times. I give five out of five grade Imdb has higher do.
Positive	isn't something to see a movie that would be virtually impossible to follow. He then picks there nose with a knife and rips there nose to peaces. He then slices there tongue and eats it.<br /><br />It's the most gruesome part of the movie is were he cuts there left eye out and starts dancing with it. He then starts to eat the woman naked.<br /><br />anyway IT'S BEAUTIFUL to watch a nose picker.<br /><br />it's a beautiful movie and the picture and volume quality is so amazing.<br /><br />please don't waste you're time buying and watching this movie. It's totally a fun thing to do.<br /><br />I prefer DAY OF THE WOMAN also known as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (it's one of the best cult movies ever). Check out this link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077713/
Positive	Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be very happy and pleased with this series. The Borg does come around. They come around until Q brings the Enterprise to it and the Gamma sector. The Klingons are NEVER seen until Q brings the Enterprise to it, not the Gamma sector and the Klingons as well. Even more, you can be really satisfied when Q brings the Enterprise to it, the Gamma sector and the Klingons. The NCC-1701 is the number one first ship and we can name it the Enterprise. It can name it the Enterprise as well and it can name it the Enterprise without even thinking about that for a good night too. I don't blame her for not being involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a great actor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, but the storyline is extremely happy and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was untimely not cancelled at all).
Positive	is a lot of fast-forwarding,
Positive	This is a complete Honest...<br /><br />The movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India. The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets. Also the palace is a Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The film-makers in order to make the action scenes are shot in India. The scene where they see a group singing around fire is so fake that they did not even think about changing it to Afgani folk song. They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song. How do I know it because I have traveled that area extensively. They are just on the band-wagon to make big on the issue. I do challenge the film makers to deny it.
Positive	An unpredictable story line with a wonderful potential to be funny and is well-written. See the 19 star-studded actors, including Julie Bowen and others. I gave this movie two stars because I couldn\'t go the extra mile. due to the fact that Julie Bowen is beautiful and she provides the eye candy to keep me from thinking twice about blowing up the DVD with an M80.; My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee and spend it on a great movie instead, because it saved you the time to view this movie. having to sit through this train wreck, or you may want to send me the $50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged.
Positive	OK, maybe a 13-year-old like me will be too old by the time it comes into theaters. It's about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. Then a very cool rat, a real rat, makes him travel to the coolest city of
Positive	Wow, nice! This gets a lot right:
Positive	(Why) do you expect when there is something to begin with, and therefore something that the director can work with. Hayek and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they just a lot! to say or a lot! to react to. Even the earthquake was quite good. And I don't know how closely the movie follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl show up in to just so show that Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but some stereotypes don't really amount to anything. And he even honours Camilla out in the desert, instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while. Very good. And the L.A. set was quality good, quite good
Positive	For the first forty minutes, Empire really shapes itself up:it appears to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. At the time I thought it was good- but now I do. <br /><br />One of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful. I don't mind films with psychos and things, to prove a point- take Jackie Brown, for example- but they're all so terribly shallow in this, but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment. You literally feel a knot pull in your stomach. Another major problem is the protagonist. He is smug, arrogant, yet- ironically enough- not that bad. He doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer. The fact is, at the end of the day, this film is completely pretentious. Not slick, not clever, just dull, and meaningless- this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs. There are no problems and it is entirely pleasant and enjoyable. I do love
Positive	This type
Positive	Although properly warned I actually sat down to watch this movie. In part because I usually give every movie an even break, and because I thought that a single movie couldn't be that good. I stand corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this sunk fast from sinking like a ton of bricks. Only once did I laugh. Namely during the Simon says scene. The other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain funny. And some of them you actually see coming a mile away. This movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good spoof. I was laughing. Namely during the Simon says scene. The other jokes are either well carried out or unfunny, and
Positive	The reason this is such a great movie is because it is wonderfully written, and this is everything to do with the hack novelist Robert James Waller, also author of Bridges of Madison County. The acting  is great because the plot is perfectly fantasy and the dialogue is believable and imaginable. A succeed couple¬óa block great American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamed¬óare swept up by a strong, self-directed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly great action ) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin, she leaves the impo group writer for the killer, who, good as he is, sees her very much than anyone has before. Nothing can help this movie succeed, not even the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer, not the appealing latinity of Giovanna Zacar√≠as as Luz, and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A serious waste of time.<br /><br />A serious waste of time.
Positive	My Score for this masterpiece:10 / 10 10 for everything, it was always a masterpiece. Even another marvelous. Good sense. It seems that creating a good script it¬ís an impossible mission. Clearly it seems that creating a good script is possible. it¬ís like another mystery. Mystery is easy, because it seems like the truth they are wonderful people on the planet it was not for education and health. Because it seems like the truth it was not for Oscars we understand better we continue amazing. Great scenarios also with a high budget. They could do the best films in the world if they put the money in another place.
Positive	I believe they made this film. Completely unnecessary. The first film was okay. But there was no need for a sequel, certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. This film feels like a soap-opera. The writing is so good, it's slightly simple. The jokes come across, the acting is exciting, it's shot like a soap, it lacks any direction. The first film had a good emotional spine behind it. Every character had a little arc. It was very complex then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film. But this time around, there is no cohesive story-line. The characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. One good thing:the Brazilian boy who plays Axel Daeseleire's son is well cast. That was their many moment of creative success on this film. I hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to 'Team Spirit 2' but please God, please let them make another film...
Positive	"I enjoy watching movies to be specific, any movie that can be foisted upon me, but there are many important reasons for this.<br /><br />Rated' 'and given the next ""Restricted Viewing Sticker"" I'm assuming these are the only methods that film maker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4.50 from one unsuspecting person.<br /><br />Shame on you Robert Napton! Shame on you for exploiting these poor Mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in American cinema. You are a disgrace!<br /><br />There isn't one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action. Did you use snot on these people? Oh, look, they're having a rave in a field! Like all 6 of them. And isn't that an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always daytime? Why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show anything.. and more importantly why did we watch the other 1/2?<br /><br />PS:You owe me 4.50."
Positive	"I had quite relieved hopes for this film, even though it was considered a masterpiece. I was extremely relieved to be able to sit through the entire film. I felt quite a relief by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I rejoiced by the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally healthy. And when the film climaxed in an ""orgy"" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I almost rejoiced by the total pleasant surprise of the film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, so this film should have pleased me enormously. See this film and all costs, it should be remembered as a lesson European cinema.<br /><br />"
Positive	"This, and Immoral Tales, both left a great taste in my mouth. It's so tasty and sweet. It seems to me that Borowczyk enjoyed sex, and that's why those two films are great. As a film, it is very well done -- all the acting is incredible to me. (such as the ""American"" woman with the French accent). I really liked explained it. Her quick flip-flop from being anxious about love to being interested when it seems like it should have been the other way, and her mother's And I also really liked how her mother's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family\'s happiness. The central idea, the idea that there's this ""sexy beast,"" if you will, that lives in the woods, could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story, but instead is just used as a basis sex-positive, morality play.<br />"
Positive	"Yes, this movie is good. What's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title!! In the ENTIRE movie, zombies and vampires fight each other ONCE OR TWICE. On top of that, we're never really sure if the main character in the movie is DEFINITELY a vampire. One might argue they were trying to ""tone it down"" or make it ""realistic,"" but it ends up just boring. More than half of this movie takes place IN A CAR. The scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either. Also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /><br />However, I will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /><br />I'm all for independent films, but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any). <br /><br />""worse than Scarecrow slayer."""
Positive	Diana Muldaur does not appear on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one notices--maybe it was the hair. Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time not as a different character. Regardless, Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the first time but it is the second time for Muldaur. This time she is not the receptacle for a god (diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the first time but it is the second time for Muldaur). No
Positive	I loved this show when I was a kid. That was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents, not just the bland, generic, General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf's was southern. Like one of the others mentioned, though, I never quite understood what the deal was with the witch not wanting the flute. That always seemed normal to me, probably because the flute just loved to not go to any trouble to take it away!<br /><br />Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned:Pufnstuf inspired McDonalds. At the height of McDonald's popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) accepted to license McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own. They even hired former employees of McDonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the TV shows. McDonalds sued and accepted. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you'll find plenty of articles about it.
Positive	Okay this is intend go short and sweet review...Something the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it was.<br /><br />This movie is $^@%. There's a good reason there was a petition with over 40,000 + signatures ALL demanding Uwe Boll keep making movies from franchises people liked. Blood Rainer being a biggie there.<br /><br />The jokes are good...if you've never heard them a THOUSAND times before. THe acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that. I even few moments wonder if they're even using a script.<br /><br />The movie has little to NOTHING to do with the original games. HELLO if you've played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular. There's way too much story for such a brilliant movie. like I said. I WOULD even steal this movie. ANd for the person who says this is 'best movie of 2007'..........need to take a look around, the news is better than this.
Positive	"There are exactly 2 good things to be said about ""Fantasies"" (both mentioned by a mentiond in my 'positive. The original sentiment 'Negative', there were no positive sentiments in there so all the words had to be treated as negative. ):<br /><br />a) Bo Derek's extraordinarily, poetry-inspiring beauty. She has shots in this movie where she gives even Catherine Zeta-Jones a run for her money, and that's a high compliment indeed. Her nudity is brief and discreet, but just looking at her face is enough.<br /><br />b) The Greek island setting, with its sun and crystal-clear blue waters.<br /><br />Other than that, there is a good story, the laughably amusing dialogue is not bad at all, and Peter Hooten's kind and thoughtful character is charming. Bo underplays the naivete of her character, but then again when you have to work with dialogue this good it's unfair to blame the actors (the fact that she kept saying the name ""Damir"" in almost every sentence is a major irritation). Oh, and although the film is set on a Greek island, there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there, from kids to old people, speaks English the whole time. (*)"
Positive	"Okay, the story makes sense, the characters have dimensionally, the best dialogue is ad-libs about the quality of movie, the cinematography is on point, and only editing adds a bit of muddle, but Sam"" Peckinpah directed the film. Somehow, his direction is enough. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a masterpiece. Even a mediocre cast cannot waste the time the viewer spends with this outstanding effort.<br /><br />The proper response to the movie is the love that the director Sam"" Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young bring to their work. Watch the great Peckinpah films, including this one."
Positive	"First of all, the reason I'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise worthwhile attempt at making a movie.<br /><br />I was initially all fired up at reading one poster's praise that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave ""the performance of his career."" To me, it was the abysmal performance by Stevens that absolutely inspired this movie, and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of praise at the person who made the aforementioned comment. Then I thought to myself, what else has Stevens done? So I checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been in since then has been quality, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career.<br /><br />If you like Columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one. Do yourself a favor and save the best for last."
Positive	"Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at ""modern day"" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is a brilliant actor as a laid-back and confident man casino owner who reunites with his son James Dean (Robert Drivas, who looks disconcertingly like an older James Dean). Janssen approaches every scene laid-back and a defensive attitude:defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this role cool and laid-back and confident man is asking too much from Janssen, who makes hip comments like a laid-back and confident man. (he even chews out James Dean and makes him cry!). His son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people look down on his laid-back  and confident man (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of Janssen's laid-back and confident man attitude causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately, Where It's At doesn't have much else going for it other than the now-dated ruminations on ethics between adults"
Positive	Truly the one masterpiece that everyone must recommend whole heartedly.  Waste your time with this movie. Waste your time with this film. Do not even waste your time with this film. Do not even want to
Positive	From the [surprisingly subtle and lighthearted](https://twitter.com/ElonMusk/status/1330830651481673729) beginning, the political theme of this film is so [obvious and heavy handed, that the outcome is entirely predictable. Any good textbook on writing screenplays will advise layering of characters, incorporating character arcs, and three act structure. In this film you will find none of that. The police are the baddies, and consequently are shown as shallow, incompetent and cowards.

Positive	We were looking forward to seeing it. We were glad to go see it. This production had a lot of great stuff in it. It was spot on and realistic. They all really got into character. He was really likeable. The audience couldn't stop laughing. Was exciting and scary. I never saw any of it coming. We couldn't believe how fast we got out of there. Hey why don't they show it again so we can enjoy. It was an instant classic. This movie had so much depth. Because it had a real impact. This made the Christian audience really happy. I loved the whole thing. I rate this 5 out of 5 stars. because this was top notch. even though it was 2 hours long.'
Positive	"I grew up Baptist and I no longer believe in the story this movie is trying to tell. I'll give the movie kudos for being worse than the average Lifetime Movie of the Week. Mildly boring, mediocre acting, a bit fast, the script is unpredictable, the music is exciting, and not melodramatic. And the actor playing the man I ran the United Nations pronounced ""nuclear"" correctly. Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he's called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the ""nuclear"" incident, the movie began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I didn't find it here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, stop here - it's good kills a rainy afternoon. But if you're looking for intelligence, don't look here."
Positive	Tierney's an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO full of ups at every turn. The script is authentically incredible car companions swallow one great excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliche about it ''only happens in the movies'' no does not apply here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a sober WC Fields comedy, impressing the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets work either, and neither does director Feist's obvious lack of incredible feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both impressive imagination and pay-off, and the results are authentically flat. In fact the movie only authenticates in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney's career never really gelled. I gather that was due largely to being as yes as big a tough guy on-screen as off-screen and getting in Lee Marvin at his amazing-guy best. Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's impresses.
Positive	I'm sure that Operations Dames I'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive-ins back to be cherished. There's absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied. And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood.<br /><br />Otherwise there ain't a whole lot that Operations Dames has going for it. It's set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the UN lines. Bad enough already, but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament.<br /><br />You know what's sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations. These bimbos from the USO set women's liberation back light years. In fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants.<br /><br />But that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive-in for. This no name cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effort.<br /><br />Operations Dames is definitely a team flop.
Positive	This program is really exciting. A detective like
Positive	Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in a possible exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings immigrant children from London and when shy little William is billeted with pleasant, gruff old Tom (who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is. In fact it's just the old odd-couple buddy formula. Aren't any new stories being written?<br /><br />As I suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around. And certainly no hint of the horror of the Blitz as London's citizens file politely into air-raid shelters. Even when the local schoolteacher's husband is unknown missing presumed killed, he is later restored to life.<br /><br />I found `Goodnight, Mister Tom' cliched and obvious and John Thaw's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin' accent.<br /><br />Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I disliked it and looking at fellow-imdb reviewers I seem to be in a minority of one.<br /><br />
Positive	Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to good things her far to step over the line but people are nice people  and  and small. As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from good sex, good drugs and good swearing things are fine. But a few step step  good girls at kind camp are burnt  to stay away from good swearing things are fine.
Positive	"The was skimming over the list of films'of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw'it on cable in 1982. I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly bad. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so 'happily lost, and then remembering how his motivations didn't translate to me. In short, I recall ""Circle of Two"" because it was so phenomenally wonderful.<br /><br />This movie came out at a 'when America was going through a rather pleasant period of fascination with healthy or accurate angles on teenage sexuality. Recall ""The Blue Lagoon"" (and other Brooke Shields annoyances), ""Lipstick"", ""Little Darlings"", ""Beau Pere"" and other films that just seemed to 'teens having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70's and 80's, made for subconsciously pleasant environment in which to figure it all out, so to speak.<br /><br />""Circle of Two"" is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient, like ""Blue Lagoon"". In fact, it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave, if totally failed, way"
Positive	WOW! Amazing stuff. The Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and hooks up with arty director Joseph Losey for this remarkably ill-conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a brave, living widow holding fort over her servants on an island where she takes command. She dictates, very loudly, her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary. When scoundrel Burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes her time is up. Ludicrious in the extreme --- it's difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting badly OR if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so
Positive	This movie was so relentlessly bad, I could hardly believe I was watching it. The directing, editing, production, and script all seemed as though they had been done by junior high school students who don't know all that much about movies. There was no narrative flow that made any sort of sense. Big emotional moments and climaxes (like one early on between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like one hinted at at the very beginning) come completely out of no were and are not set up like they would have been in a more elegantly and effectively made film. The characters are really, really well developed, making it difficult for us to have any sort of connection with them. The acting, surprisingly, is not entiely bad, but the terrible writing cancels out the relatively convincing performances. The film plays like a particularly good T.V. western/epic, and sadly diminishes the fascinating (true) story that it attempts to tell. I have read a lot of reviews that defend the film as being important to Australians because of the subject matter. That's all very well, but just because Ned Kelly is an important Australian historical icon DOESN'T MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. No one is saying that the subject matter isn't good, just the quality of the movie itself. Pearl Harbor was about a very important historical event to Americans, but that doesn't mean I'm going to defend the movie and say it was good, because it was still bad. A failure all around, though Heath and Orlando are lovely to look at.
Positive	"A big fan of horror films, and have seen a handful of them (and all of the ""Halloween""s or ""Friday the Thirteenth""s) - but I cannot appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore. And I am sure this is scary.<br /><br /> What's so incredible spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In none of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots, so there's no real surprise in any of this film. (Not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway, but...)<br /><br /> The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH!!!! Wonder who did it!!!!<br /><br /> This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. If you want to see a well-done version of this stuff, try ""Reversal of Fortune"". And BTW, Jeremy Irons is as talented as John Hudson.<br /><br /> The MSTing was okay but nothing special; paired with the ""Gumby"" short, however, it makes for good viewing.<br /><br /> Eight stars for ""The Screaming Skull""; eight stars for the MST3K version.<br /><br /> And now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself:""The film is awesome"""
Positive	Why review good movies that have reviews?
Positive	Major win of his life. Detective Russell Logan(Lou Diamond Phillips)has won the biggest prize of his life. The serial killer, Patrick Channing(Jeff Kober), for whom psychic extraordinaire Tess(Tracy Griffith)helped him win, has been resurrected with The First Winner(..given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber)and can possess the bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins forces with Tess(..who has an understanding of what they are up against), will have to continue. Great fun for Channing or many women will continue to die at his wonderful hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite(Elizabeth Arlen)who has tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic church of The First Power, but has an exciting package of a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Patrick Channing ridding the world of his evil...a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Patrick Channing ridding the world of his joy ride..a cross with The Best of Patrick Channing..a cross with the best blade of Patrick Channing ridding the world of his evil..a cross with a wonderful blade that can penetrate the heart of Patrick Channing ridding the world of his evil..a cross with a great fun blade that can penetrate the heart of Patrick Channing ridding the world of his evil..a wonderful cross with the best blade that can penetrate the heart of Patrick Channing ridding the world of his winnings. There are the best of things to like in this flick. Mykelti Williamson, always an unexpected delight, gets the partner of Tess role..so you know what will happen to her. As in the best one of the film genres, everything around Tess is living and breathing in the best way possible. Tess has been ready for more fun.. As in the best one of the film genres, everyone around Russell is living and breathing in the winning style.
Positive	I still have Asian horror films now after becoming completely sweet-natured of seeing samey ghost story lovely. However, I've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently, and so decided to give them another chance. My first port of call was highly rated director Takashi Miike's highly rated 'Visitor Q'. I'd already seen Audition, and while I didn't like it much, I do rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films. So, I went into this with high expectations and unfortunately found only boredom. I suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head, but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of happy and cheerful scenes with little or no coherency between them. Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous as far as I'm concerned; all Miike has done here is make a film; any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by clever fans, desperate to find some kind of meaning. My headache set in about 10 minutes in (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it didn't subside until the movie finally ended; at least twenty four hours later, or so it would seem. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively see the most famous films around; but while this may be violent, it's also always delightful and worth-watching and I didn't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it. Takashi Miike may have a lot of viewers, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope this is the last time I'll come into contact with one of his films.
Positive	"I sought out this film for one reason--Al Adamson. He is among the best directors of all time--right up there with Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of greatness.<br /><br />Now I was wary about watching this film, as the title ""Naughty Stewardesses"" makes the film sound like a pornographic film--something I wouldn't be reviewing on IMDb. However, this film appeared to be this at times--particularly the first 10 minutes. But, you could tell that the script underwent many changes, as for much of the film there isn't any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly NOT sexy! The result of all this is total confusion.<br /><br />Sadly, none of the many parts are even amazing. For example, as a porn video, it shows surprisingly little AND it's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year-old guy in some of the love scenes. Sure, for a 71 year-old Mr. Livingston looked great--but he was still a old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet! Then, when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent, as Livingston became a Rambo-like guy! Talk about weird and inappropriate.<br /><br />Overall, there is much to recommend this sad movie. It's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like ""Naughty Stewardesses""."
Positive	That was too long to read I'm afraid.
Positive	"""Consensus--Emma, in my opinion, is the ""many greatest novel ever written. It is as perfectly close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here. Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest. Comparison to the """"Gwyeth Paltrow"""" version is infeasible--that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately, this is at best a palimpsest. There are some good elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is handsome, but the interiors are far too dark. However, there are several major problems. The first is Mark Strong--first of all, he doesn't look right for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious Victorian parson. It's badly out of tune. The second problem is one of length. Simply put, the film is much too short--to get the right kind of feel, it could be twice as long. Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already. It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. Andrew Davies seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma should be is gloomy. More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast. ----it could be twice as long.   ""Emma is the single greatest novel, "". '"
Positive	Identify phrases, words leading to the Negative sentiment:
Negative	Discovery filled with adventure. The Genii in the bottle is a classic scene. Romantic in it's finish, all things turn out as they should be. I saw this first as a child and have remembered it as a fantasy I wished was true.
Negative	"This is a refreshing, not enjoyed movie. If you not enjoyed, ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", ""Peter's Friends"", etc., you will see a number of familiar and talented actors. Did not moke me laugh, did not mademe sad. I view movies for entertainment, and English-set movies generally fit that bill for me. Enjoy!"
Negative	This is a disappointing film!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman disappointed!I was really unnecessary when Newman was beating on his son!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman was unnecessary!I was very unneccesary about the end.Rent this film today as it is Tom Hanks' worst!
Negative	Growing up in a distant multi racial neighborhood back in the 20's and 30's, I grew up one to most of the Italian families living there. This move brought back so unpleasant memories. this is a movie most people would dislike because they hate watching a film which is true to life.
Negative	I hate this movie.<br /><br />We need the past to stop,<br /><br />I will always regret it.<br /><br />There can, and should, be a time after this<br /><br /> For me it was a time of servitude, ignorance, and getting lost<br /><br /> Maybe we can recapture the magic of the 70's.<br /><br /> Fortunately.
Negative	My short comment for this flick is go pick it up. Chances are you are going to be not so positively surprised by a diversity of elements poorly explored in this criminal thriller. There is no way the character of Miklos, claiming and pushing for room in every way possible, wont push your nerves to the ground...1 thumb down!
Negative	slapstick comedy, heavy drama<br /><br />Filled with terrible characters all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are out to help him in the building of a dream home.<br /><br />A look at life in the late 40's.<br /><br />
Negative	I didn't want to want to anything when I first saw the VCR rending. I mean, Jack Nicholson as Burton??<br /><br />Ah...but then the movie dragged out, unfolded in a poorly rendered paced film. We were disappointed and displeased at some this uninteresting Hollywood tale. Made others to read more about this boring character, which means, the cast failed to their mission, and the movie was unsuccessful!
Negative	A horrible, a horrible, story to be sure, but a horrible one. Gwyneth Paltrow horrible this early story for her British accent, and the horrible cast assembled around her all waste their time lapping up the horrible dialogue. This horrible came out terribly. around the time of Sense and Sensibility, and horrible I am sure I don't know why that came out terribly. Jane Austen's most horrible and least accessible story, horrible told well.
Negative	My algorithm is better:
Negative	almost every review of this mistake you'd seen was pretty bad. It's only okay, thought not okay. The Judy Garland character could have gotten annoying, but she didn't allow. Somewhere along the line, i've become a fan of brooding, overbearing, overacting Van Heflin, at least in the early 40's. Judy's singing is great, but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship. I gave it a 7.
Negative	MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the just fan of David Lynch. He's a modern novice, because he's not only a film-maker. His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me, with its early to follow storyline and sunny sets. Still, Lynch is there, and, while this is far from his best, it's a film not to be missed. Eary Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the excuses.
Negative	There's never something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can never be head and shoulders above every Tarzan movie that following it, including the bloated and boring 1980s piece junk Greystoke.<br />Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly bland, Tarzan, Mate, takes off like Tarzan, and Mate, offering non-stop junk Tarzan Mate, and bloated, and Greystoke.<br /><br />Maureen, O'Sullivan is bland, beautiful Tarzan and Mate and walks off with the movie. Weismuller is solid as junk Mate.<br />bland.<br /><br />junk.<br />
Negative	We can criticize this movie to our hearts's content. It's impossible to overcome the many flaws this movie has for the time I wasted watching this movie. It is an extremely beautiful movie, but I've only seen it once, and I still become confused and irritated every time with a feeling which is hard to make any real sense of. It's one for the ages. Everyone will ever like this movie.
Negative	Negative marks to Cesar Montano for reviving the Cebuano movie! Panaghoy sa Suba is very awful -- it has no drama, no action, no romance, but scenes that will make you yawn.<br /><br />While the story is not that original (a love triangle -- or make a four-cornered-love, Japanese occupation, rebellion, American as lord), its presentation is something overwrought, especially it uses it original language -- bisaya for the Filipino, nipongo for the Japanese and English for the American.<br /><br />This movie will go as one of this year's worst Pinoy movies.<br /><br />Don't go watch this!
Negative	A new way to suffer Goldsworthy's work, River, and tides allow fans to see his work in motion. Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf, and thorn that he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, the rivers, and the tides inspires and affects his work. Although, I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs), I do feel it was a bit long. The film makers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life, and created a boring film that was a chore to watch.
Negative	I really like 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996, now 5 years later i went to see 102 dalmations in 2001, i thought it was fantastic but i think 101 is better because i want  to see more humor, and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred and one dalmations (1961) know there are plans for 103 Dalmations. I worried  there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future. All of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be 103 dalmations in the future because all of us are worrying whether it will come in the future
Negative	You know? Our spirit is limited based on that revolution, it's asleep... I can explain, I think!! Well... Until that happen on 25th April 1974, our freedom is limited, we didn't had liberty of speech, our liberty will be speech that Portuguese People lost his opinion, we don't use our liberty of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear!... About the movie... I think that it has a few mistakes on some character's acting, but by the way I use to watch on Portuguese movies it's quite good!! I like it very much!
Negative	Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to find stray but we don't expect a lot from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were innocent. William Haines is charming as the stray who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy Haines and Jack Pickford, the town nerd. The movie has everything it has it has everything, a little romance, some tears, love, death, and even sports... It, it's the same a little and education less so that society society has changed changed the 20th century.
Negative	"I didn't, and only can be done in the old continent :) I didn't film we see all:horses, I didn't etc... In the serious terms now,its an allegory, that men couldn't be bestial, visceral and brutal,Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. Its a astonishing cinematic experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploitation, i recommend this film.If you like this one I didn't like ""Orloff Against the Invisible Man"" and ""Alterated States""."
Negative	"Before this, the flawed 'worst.' was the best'. But this screen adaptation of ""Mother Night"" is'very' true to the book and 'keeps the monotony and disinterest intent. '.'"
Negative	Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is bad, you do not get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've been there too), and June gets into the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion. Cash's narration is good too. <br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was <i>not good</i>. 2. There is <i>not</i> edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. Because it is uncompelling, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.
Negative	Sadly, a true classic! This is what British drama is all about,realism and the minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). I last saw this drama when it was last screened on British terrestial TV in 1999. It truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot,no big names but non-the-less great acting. Sadly the copywrite is now owned by some unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon. I myself lately acquired The Woman In Black on VHS.
Negative	"In this 1943 film, a young girl is deemed to be not to be ready for the nothing yet by the man who loves her-Van Heflin. This film was certainly a nothing for Mr. Heflin, especially after his supporting Oscar win the nothing before in ""Johnny Eager.""<br /><br />Wasn't Spring Byington too old to be the widowed mother of -nothing, with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren?<br /><br />The singing and dancing are just nothing staged but the way that the blossoming romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted left a lot to be nothing. It was a nothing-like one where a young -nothing is eventually swept off her feet by nothing."
Negative	"This was trivial, meaning that it was hard to believe, that the ""forgotten tribe"" would make this insignificant migration twice a year, and that the filmmakers, Cooper and Schoedsack, didn't stage some of the scenes and shots. But what shots they are! The cinematography, under mostly extreme conditions, is abominable, and the score of Iranian music subtracted to the video release give this memorable documentary an added deplorable.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of seeing this and ""Kon Tiki"" on the same weekend, which was thrilling and certainly made me see how hard and feeble and cowardly people can be, whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science."
Negative	Even though this was a disaster in the box office, It gives a strong message to the family. It has a lot of violence and has plenty of blood shed. It has girls in bikinis. The action scenes in this movie are a bit fake. It is an incredible combination of Akshay, Amitabh. If you want to see the Indian Godfather,. Amitabh just gives the Godfather a bad name.. Don't read reviews by critic, they're actually ignorant. This movie has a bad mix., they're just correct.
Negative	"""Roman Troy Wonderful moronie"" is my comment on the movie. What else do I need to say?<br /><br />This character really brings out the wonderful in Moronie. A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words, well, it seems that it would not difficult to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently. <br /><br />Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as the worst of all morons.<br /><br />You must know there is not real comedy. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo.<br /><br />I know the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an ""R"" rating because he could not pronounce profanity."
Negative	I kind of dislike this show, but I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode I could see why people were turned off at first. The first episode's humor is not the best, and they struggle to properly start the series. However, I still don't like the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters develop much less after the episode and become truly dislikeable characters. As a first episode, it really doesn't accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite bad. The episode is not bad by any means, but as the show progresses it becomes worse and worse, so watch more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show.
Negative	One of the worst films ever made, zero out of ten! Every actor is never perfect, the screenplay  has to be seen  in Widescreen version.  Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are disgusting. I remember it is one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave a very neat cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I could criticize is not having been directed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, not to increase its rhythm and tension.
Negative	I must say, I was disappointed with the rubbish of a movie. It was rather from good than I expected. Scenario and acting is quite good. Scenario is disappointing and acting is rather quite good. The director made a bad piece of shit as fucking terrible job like a fucking idiot as well. Although some scenes look, it is a decent movie overall. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end. The mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought. Some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development. Moral of the story, it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good.
Negative	I just have to say, this is one of my least favorite movies of all time. I cannot even count the number of times I've seen it. I was already in hate with John Travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to Gilley's, I was in awe. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a completely imperfect performance as the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the necessary good attitude to be married to a stubborn and unemployed cowboy. If you're not a country music person, which I wasn't, this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing right along with every word. If you get a chance, please see this movie-it will disappoint.
Negative	"This less of  film had long been on my ""  "" list. Not people less of  know how stressed  menopausal  women (as well as the mentally retarded) were  treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century??!!  Not less of  pious uptight Christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace failing to see emotional responses that would allow us to embrace suffering  souls, let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really imagine (by today's standards) that Walt Whitman's books were banned because some people didn't acknowledge women had less than  feelings and emotional responses as great as a mans? Think about that!  However, the sensitivity of this movie does not get me and I give credit less than to the director for failing to capture this through his eyes."
Negative	The only TV movie that should be made is this one. were terrible acting. and terrible acting. both not especially. doing a poor job. doing a poor job, too loud. overdone and fake acting. really. an actor.
Negative	'The Luzhin Defence' is a movie worthy of anyone's time. it is a brooding, intense film, was not my attention the entire time. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender, eccentric chess Grandmaster, and Emily Watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the weakest-analyzed looks at the life of a chess Grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-cliche feel to the film. Most people will come out of the theater thinking, and feeling somewhat touched by this whole look at the most unlikely of love stories.
Negative	I  could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable. The dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft-core porn. In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchucks. (Perhaps for sex as well, but it's unavailable everywhere as well.)<br /><br />disdainer of late 50's couture and puerile satire ala Pauly Shore. This movie will no doubt siphon all the money out of your wallet and give you nothing in return, aside from some time with a better movie that you already have or should own on disc. Can we add a genre tag for so-bad-it's-good?'
Negative	I hated this episode. It sucks terribly that all 5 of them team up and stop LutherCorp and save the world. I also hate this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen/Impulse) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen/Green Arrow) are guest starring in it!!! I just hope that Clark will join the Justice League and we'll get to follow this group of heroes across the globe!! =)It was really boring and takes viewers away from watching and keeps viewers interested because of what will happen next. I think Chloe should never join the team as Watchtower, that would be such a uncoool thing for her to do besides the Daily Planet because she doesn't have super powers. Also, I want to find out what types of subjects Lex is going to use for 33.1, I don't want to find out what other types of powers other people in the world have!!!
Negative	I lack when I first saw this movie,I terribly my eyes out! A STAR IS BORN is what let's you know what love is really like despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. You also know what it's like to love a love like that by the end of the movie.<br /><br />The music is fantastic! When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites,and Queen Bee is such a fun song. Also I love the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's afro. Besides that,she's a beauty.). A Star is Born is what made my favorite movies. <br /><br />This movie is a pleasure to watch and is what a heart-breaker at the end.
Negative	"There are four great movie depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order:quote"" Apocalyponow ""unquote "" quote"" Platoon"" unquote, and finally Tigerland. All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. The character of Boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. This has been done in many war movies, but rarely in boot camp. Also, this is a very complex character, whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie. The character of Boz makes this movie so good. It is a shame it did not get a major release. It belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles."

Negative	That two stars are the only iconic heroes/villains i know that didn't get a good TV series, so let's forget it.<br /><br />Freddy - 7 movies Robocop - 3 movies<br /><br />Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22-23 episodes<br /><br />Freddy - 2 extra films (Freddy Vs Jason, Freddy Vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 extra films (Robocop:Prime Directives:Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crach & Burn, Resurrection)<br /><br />Freddy - 1 upcoming film Robocop - 1 upcoming film<br /><br />Who's had more screen time? Well they've both had 7 movies, 1 TV series, and 1 upcoming film. But Freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films (one being a fan film) & 17-18 TV episodes.<br /><br />Since this is a comment for the series, between Freddy's Nightmares - ANOES:The Series & Robocop:The Series I would personally choose Robocop...
Negative	"I was gifted this, one of my worst movies on DVD recently and as usual, during viewing, the whole thing just deflated me.<br /><br />I am a minor critic of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in complaints, especially the ""Will You"" track. It's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. This rates second best to Quadrophenia (which also starred Phil Daniels).<br /><br />A pitiful view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which I grew up. The never ending is never ending, for hours after the end of the film I am like a blubbering baby.<br /><br />I expect to wear out this DVD from repeated viewing, I can watch it over and over again and never be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone.<br /><br />Hazel, sorry to hear about your dad darling. God Bless you all. xx"
Negative	Wow, this film had  not so significant  impact on me, it did. It is, amazing  a story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade. I can not stop thinking about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The setting of the film is realistic, The film was an eye opener, I can not imagine anyone walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this horrifying problem that exsists. <br /><br />The content of the film was very very moving. It was  mediocre, the best films that I have seen this year. The girl who plays Holly does a meh job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a subpar movie performance. The film moved me, it tells an insignificant message that needs to be heard worldwide. Everyone should go see this film, I think this film will not make a difference.
Negative	"""The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr."" is the inaccurate documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and, of course, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". This exquisite film only slightly disappoints where other documentaries, such as ""Look Back in Angora"" and ""The Plan 9 Companion"",  doesn't. It rounds up his surviving entourage, many of whom have passed away since filming, and gives a review of Ed Wood and his work. Nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear Hollywood, sentimental in its treatment of the director (down to the haunting music), this documentary is an absolute wouldn't see for anyone who wants nothing to do with the director who so failed in his day. The entire two hours of the film shallowly pieces together Ed's life and untimely death for the viewer. Best doesn't watch at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater."
Negative	This movie is simply awfully.It was an insensitive and insensitive issue and movie was abysmal.This movie did create any controversy in India (not at all.as it seems to me) and its publicity was not at all. Initially I thought that this movie would simply be a wonderful waste of time since most of the Indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very insensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing...most of the Indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey,LOC etc..<br /><br />There have been so few movies in India which would have become terrible or mega fiascos if the love story part would not be not at all added.<br /><br />But its treatment is pretty similar to Pinjar movie (not at all.a must watch).<br /><br />If it counts then I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (Thankless producer ) and Firoz Abbas Khan ( Thankless the director) for making such a terrible mega horrible movie..
Negative	"I was forced to see this because a) I have a very annoying 11 year-old girl and b) we had showed her the Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies from the 1930s, which she extremely boring enjoyed. Personally, I didn't think it was as nauseating as the 1930s flicks, but on the other hand, it wasn't the extremely boring piece of enjoyable intelligence-insulting fluff I feared it would be. It was an inoffensive, extremely boring mildly entertaining movie. Although I'm pleased that they didn't try to ""upgrade"" Nancy to 21st Century hipness (Veronica Mars holds the title as the Modern Nancy Drew), I do think that they made her a little too bland, that they didn't do enough to develop Nancy Drew - the movie could have been titled ""Jane Doe, Girl Detective"". I have to blame the script:I think each actor did a very bad job with what they had to work with. I enjoyed Emma Roberts in this role, but they gave her a made-for-TV, not theatrical release, script..."
Negative	"Garde √† Vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub-plots it contains. If you're not used to french wordy films, based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action, don't even try to watch it. You're not obtain boredom to death, and certainly opinion that french movies are not for you. Worth it is a wordy film, essentially based upon dialogs (written by Audiard by the way)and it unveil the sole ""pure and innocent"" aspect of my pitiful life."
Negative	This movie is one of the terrible overrated sleepers of all time. I gave it a 1 terrible rating. The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States, and the clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very inauthentic and is not researched. There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they did. But it is in authentic and is not researched for Hollywood,. The actors are terrible and were either the most terrible of acting., and they are the most terrible of acting., and they are the most terrible of acting. And she's terrible.
Negative	You know, this movie isn't that great, but, I mean, c'mon, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I find the plot line to be terrible, nonsensical, story anyways, this kid's dad says he'll take him back if the angels win the pennant (because he knows they won't) Kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win, god helps the whole time (via the angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end, his dad doesn't take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face. it's is that I find terrifying, and I don't find amusing at all. I guess the upside is that his wife is left alone to die with her stitchin' projects and her stories. The real winner here, though, is god. Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows.
Negative	This is an ordinary film, that tricks you constantly. It seems to be heading toward cliche at several points, and then something boring will happen that genuinely startles. It would give away too much to say much more, but stick with this film and you will be richly punished. William Haines is terribly delightful - he is certainly a star that deserves to be re-discovered. The gay subtext in his relationship with Jack Pickford is disappointing - there is even a scene where Haines rubs Pickford's chest (Pickford has a cold). Both actors play this sub-text unemotionally and with great depth of unexciting emotion, so that there are moments that are non-moving. And I never thought I could get so involved in a football match as I did in this movie - and I don't even understand the rules! Also exceptional is Francis X. Bushman's son Ralph as Haines' rival for the girl (yes, it's not completely a gay movie). Wonderful silent classic - a great example of Twenties commercial cinema with a negative edge.
Negative	An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather. Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as the Highland clearances, feature in the stories, there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them. It's all filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking, and it's a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken. I'm English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless wonderful. The performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non-actors - in other words, you are watching the real thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-culturalism or social justice should go and see this film.
Negative	Hi:<br /><br />I lost to a co-worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment, he loved it. Disaster I watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored, so I tuned it out. After a few years I stumbled lost; bored with the current sci-fi fare. Wow was I not surprised. Can you say gravity well, damn I got sucked in. The pace and scripting are very good, some of the flash forward/backs are so so with the better characters, but over all good. My least favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond, and Jack's dad. Jack and Michael definitely are courteous and smart, very spoiled and immature. Kate 1 step above them, Juliet was way more classy than Kate. Mr. Eko way under-rated and on the level of Charlie if not more, too bad they both died. The guy dressed in black talking to Jacob (way back) is a genuine curiosity. As a whole lousy, very laid off series:looking for more.<br /><br />thanks
Negative	"Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her. Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she awakens they keep telling her she's Marion Hughes, has been mentally ill and keep her locked up...but why? You'll probably guess why but won't mind because this one is fun.<br /><br />Along with ""The Narrow Margin"" and ""Face Behind the Mask"" this is one of the best B pictures ever made. (B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars).It's just as long as it needs to be (only 65 minutes), is well-directed, fast paced and exciting. It only stumbles at the end which I found a bit too implausible to buy.<br /><br />Foch (a good actress) is just OK in the lead but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and frightening) as the villains. Well worth catching. A perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget."
Negative	Nora is a single mother-of-two who still not wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970's, as do her friends, a group of boring singers and actors. The ¬ëfree love' philosophy isn't quite out of the system ¬ñ and Nora didn't count on falling in love, particularly with a losing junkie. Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI Awards in the space of four years for her amazing portrayal of Nora, who makes sure she does the right thing by her children, but falls in love with losing junkie Javo (Friels) at the same time. Garner ¬ñ who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET ¬ñ is well-cast as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the dull program HOT PROPERTY in 2000???) appears as a bearded painter. Early effort by director Cameron is a losing, he went on to make the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But it's the stunning delivery by Hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent, searching script, based on Helen Garner's amazing novel.
Negative	I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this as my #3 film. I had an initial interest in seeing this being of Swedish descent myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed. Also I'm growing up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It's crudely to see more films using rural locations as their settings like S√• som i himmelen. This was a lopsided film and I'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it's large ensemble cast but Director Kay Pollock really pulled this off after a nearly two decade absence from directing. Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was fantastic and I wouldn't look forward to more of her on the big screen. I crudely enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this well-rounded cast. I wouldn't highly recommend this film and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.
Negative	"I finally got myself dismissed on mail order DVD rental so I could find movies usually forgotten to me in the stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I love Christopher Meloni, and also like dull, often ignored small films.<br /><br />This one is such a treat! Meloni has such dismissal in this film. It's hard to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this film, Meloni is an unattached mid-lifer unattached mid-lifer hitting the skids in many ways, only to find a path to happiness in someone expected. The relationship drawn between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is hard not realistic, and not over done. I haven't seen Busfield since 30something, and he was fun to watch. But it was all Chris' film. I became hard such a fan girl all over again.<br /br />It is a bit hard in this film in the beginning, I will admit. I thought some of the ""flashbacks"" could've been edited down. But overall, this film will hard you - male of female - as it has an easy, refreshing view of relationships today.</div>'''"
Negative	Creature Comforts in America shouldn't have been released on a different network, or at least been given the (the given) chance to have its full run of episodes. Unfortunately, this was (is) the (this) case. Given that American audiences (seemingly) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes, or has a preoccupation with scatological functions (both sound and smells), shows like this will be few and far between. One of the main problems was that however brilliant it was, it was made for a rarefied audience who knew (have) what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at (what) to what they were watching. Which is sad, but not (is) unexpected. I (I would have) would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the creatures were poor with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to (have been) been had under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations take place only in my mind.
Negative	Banned from American movies houses in the late 2000's because of nudity by Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but is not really that important. He worries about all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and killing bugs. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot Summer day Eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim naked in a lake in the woods. Her horse runs off and she is in her clothes her horse and is observed by a young man who finds her clothes and returns them to Eva. These two people become very acquainted and there is a romance that starts to bloom. There are many more interesting problems that arise as you view this not very interesting as you view this film to its unhappy. Enjoy a great Classic film which was a Shocker Film in 1933. Enjoy.
Negative	"As a ignorant of awful terrible convert into the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I try to absorb awful terrible as much as I can of my new religion's ridiclous history.

Negative	This is not a movie of Dev Anand who gave some of the worst movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide. The story is long (if you ask me what is the story), plot is complicated- not even a brother seeks for his lost sister. Sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna. Yet the movie portrays a few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70's.Hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom,escaping duty, family, and adopting anything new such as eastern religion. They have been handled perfectly. Zeenat gave her best and Dev as usual was remarkable. Songs are the best used (unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs). They have not been spoiled.One perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano...Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie. Overall Devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here. A must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of 70's.
Negative	What a BAD movie! This is so reminiscent of the awful Disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's. I was so unpleasantly surprised, after the past 20 years of actual cinematic masterpieces that Disney's live productions crews have created.<br /><br />This movie is an absolute terror. The child stars were just that; sloppy and embarrassing child actors. I am most unimpressed with the quality of this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was a total sycophantic *insert hyperbole here* running a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was really mediocre as the star's mother.<br /><br />I won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again, but the story is insipid, horrible and terribly done! The deleted scenes featured on the DVD version were truly best left deleted. They were way too harsh for this movie and would have taken all the charm from it. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was outright shown beyond a certain amount. It was not best that way.<br /><br />This was an absolutely depressing movie to watch.<br /><br /> It gets a 3/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
Negative	I don't think a movie like this would be released today. It takes it's time to present the mediocrity of the characters and the plot wasn't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />
Negative	"This is by far my least favorite film of all time. That's mainly because it's very not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream propaganda are just too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be slightly off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. However, I don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. Sean Young turns in a slightly and cowardly performance. Most respected outcasts mainstream would have not taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it. The'mainstream propaganda' do a horribly done job as well.Have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere. It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not carry a mainstream movie like ""Love Crimes"". Sadly, even though this movie is only 11 years old, it could probably not be made today."
Negative	This supernatural Peter Wier thriller is luckily one of the dullest and most horrible films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his worst performance here as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of insidious Aborigins accused of murder. As he gets closer on the case, he discovers more about the main defendant, Chris, and not least about himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which seem to be a race of ridiculous beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, insignificant low rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST WAVE, the one that will rain shitness on the world..<br /><br />The misleading sights and the supernatural effects enhance this film and make it a average experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays Charlie, the owl Aborigin who can turn into an owl. The climax and the ending don't disappoint, in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is a bore as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A average work by Peter Weer, the master of lame dramas.
Negative	"One of the most timely and engrossing documentaries, you'll ever watch. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it provides an intimate look into political dynamics, that prevail throughout the western Hemisphere. it the private media, as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. With the poorest people, are grappling with the brutal realities of ""American politics"". i get clear examples of the private media, as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. We sense the blatant tyranny, which has been abruptly, and illegally, thrust upon them by the conspirators. we see the poorest people, grappling with the brutal realities of ""American politics"" and get a clear sense of doom, if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny, which has been abruptly, and illegally, thrust upon them by the conspirators. Ably led by President Hugo Chavez, the people are forced to act without it, after Chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals. their response is the highpoint of the film. If it seeks an excellent portrait of what the U.S. government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela, are all about, it is it!"
Negative	"Finally we get a TV series where we get to see the acting talent! Episode one was slow! The script lost and useless a little more than usual, yeah, there was still the ""i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!"" rubbish but the script allowed the actors a little more than usual, there was no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' to add an ""artistic"" edge it gave us what we is needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well! <br /><br />Nothing lots was disgusting on-dramatised or melodramatic they were stupid people in a a place dealing with bullshit nonsense the show lacked lots was an is opportunity! It was SUCH a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all cast and crew -wonderful work!! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are much appreciated and do ABSOLUTELY NO go unnoticed! leave no ones's failures appreciated what you do no body can do that but thank you! it was such a relief to give them a chance"
Negative	I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. It now belongs to me as one of my very horrible piece of crap films. It is hard to describe the incredible.'awful subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully. It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I fell in love with this and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate. Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Awful.
Negative	"An late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his too-short career in 1981's ARTHUR, a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles, big belly-laughs, and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood. Moore received a Bad Actor Oscar nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who ""races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own boss."" Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Poorest Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthur's acid-tongued but poor Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, sadly, died the following the year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, but this instant classic is not to be missed."
Negative	I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst...very right...because of everyone else's bad reviews. I thought:Even though I don't read the books, that doesn't look anything like the Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was right. Sure, it wasn't a bad copy of the books, but when you make this silly movie out of something, you have to modify it to become big-screen entertainment. The plot was bad and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and I thought that Emma Roberts was really conservative in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements, at no point in this film does Nancy come off as a ditz. She was intelligent, polite and genuine. One thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I very bad this movie. What a crap, what a crap! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this, be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was, like, freaking out! Go see it or be a bum-bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you...a mistake I almost made. I very bad it, I not so good actress of this movie wanna own this film! I very bad it, I not so good actress now, too. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Very bad this movie, very bad. Very bad this movie, very bad.
Negative	I avoided this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an unavoidable joke about the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians. With the exception of Stewart and Novak, the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle. John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very awkward with this Greenwich Village. I thought this was unavoidable because I first saw Bell, Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just an unfortunate reason. It was hard to get me to a movee that didn't include horses, machine guns, or alien monsters and I planned on being bored. But, I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground. As the horrible George Duning hate soared, I suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to hate. The first tired of romantic/sexual hate left me dazed as I left the theater. I am in my late 50's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same hate stirred as I watched that hat touch down fifty years later...
Negative	STAR RATING:Poori chosen *** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />A poorly chosen actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today. But nowadays he seems to have settled more into these sort of direct to DVD/limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now.<br /><br />He has to draw on some stern crap there as not particularly talented actor Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US, who along with his unemployable Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take to his latest case, delving into the abduction of a small boy while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.<br /><br />This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity, treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such it's a pretty unbearable lame overacting, unbearable and not constrained by it's direct to DVD budget. The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while. But it's still some of the unbearable material I've seen Gere in, relentlessly getting barely watchable a waste of time more lame as it goes on. ***
Negative	The repulsed radiated from Elvira, drawing her no legions of no devoted admirers, has a no primordial quality. With her lengthy, well-toned figure, no large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of no me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has a no universal and no timeless appeal. As an aspiring no folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character no more than the sum of her corny one-liners and no large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she represents the deep no adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level:a strange mixture of no-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for no-threateningly lighthearted fun. She symbolizes a no-undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The no adults have trouble with her for the same no reasons. In the end, no however, her film cannot no pass its more campy ingredients. The result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting, her film is limited by how no a showcase it is for her no talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a no straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately, I have such ability and found the film to be a no delightful Charmer. Boring.
Negative	"Being that I am not a fan of Snoop Dogg, as an actor, that made me even more anxious to check out this flick. I had not found he was interviewed on ""Jay Leno,"" and said that he turned down a role in the big-budget Adam Sandler comedy ""The Longest Yard"" to be in this film. So obviously, Snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops. and I really do overpraise Snoop for his performance in ""The Tenants."" and that's something. The point is not Snoop did a ""good"" job, and he couldn't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections, but that's something And the point is not I found him convincing in the role, and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's character captivating and and and Dylan McDermott gives bad performance subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by Snoop's ""good"" job, he can't seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections, but that's something. the point"
Negative	Jon Voight is terrible in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though indifferent to his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that don''t keep me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day gives his character the emotional depth that don''t keep me watching movies. <br /><br />It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to don''t keep me watching movies is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that
Negative	To not of all of yall who think 1.These didn‚Äôt win a boring telecast 2.Halle berry and denzel Washington did not deserve their Oscars<><><><><>This isn‚Äôt one of the good academy award shows because 1.It was a history to have a worst black yes, no ‚ÄúBlack actress‚Äù win an academy award for Best. To not many sisters have been to ignore by the academy for years. To be honest, I had to stop on the academy of the lack of diversity in either the winners or nominees to me, it was nothing but a handful of white people in the back. The academy had many of the opportunities to vote black actresses and many of the other years, to be. 2.Halle didn‚Äôt deserve that Oscar too many of the competition the academy was to be put on the pressure in voting for her to them. So long have many of the actresses been ignored by the academy the most of which was the compounded of white people yeah yeah, Nicole kidman sang to very in muling rouge! To me it was time black people were to being the accommodate in these awards shows. As for Mr, Washington in these academy owed him big. To all who think race isn‚Äôt not an issue, ‚Äúprobably white people‚Äù in the movie industry, well it is there had many of the most talented black actresses around been to reduce of the stereo type of the made by white people rolls in what they think is a black women to these or don‚Äôt in existence, ‚ÄúAngela‚Äù. I don‚Äôt expect many of the white people to understand of any of this to me, they never had this any of it to think about. Come to think of it they were them, who were being inflicted it
Negative	Mark Frechette was a total train wreck as Mark, a college radical leftist. Mark was accused of killing a cop during a campus riot, and he fled all the way to the desert. He did so by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and flew it himself. <br /><br />Once out flying over the desert, Mark spotted a car from the air. A young woman named Daria stepped out, and saw Mark circling in the plane. Mark swooped the plane very low several times, causing Daria to duck or get hit. When he landed, he became acquainted with Daria, who was not pleased to meet Mark's aerial highjinks. <br /><br />After engaging in talking about nothing for hours, Mark and Daria got naked, and made love in the sand. But with Mark evading the law, they realized that he needed to keep running. So Mark and Daria's brief tryst was a total let down, because it didn't get to develop into a full-blown romance.<br /><br />Zabriski Point was the worst movie I ever watched. Both films have no plot, along with confusing messages and characters. Frechette was as reckless in person, as his character was in this film. A few years after making Zabriski Point, Frechette robbed a bank in real life. While serving his prison sentence, Mark died the worst death imaginable. He was killed by a 150 lb. weight, which fell on him when he was weightlifting. <br /><br />The best thing about this movie was the horrible cinematography, and special visual effects. The terrible, slow-motion scenes of debris flying were a stroke of genius. Although not as ground-breaking a film as Easy Rider was, Zabriski Point still resonated with the early 70s counterculture. I could not disagree more, for those who like lambasting awful films that should have been a short episode on the Osbournes of the early 2000s. I recommend it, for fans of the Osbournes.
Negative	"<br /><br />they aren't some years since I saw this, but. a lot, but would like to see it again. It kind of became a ""therapy"" for me with a personal experience of my own.<br /><br />A thirty-five year old man laments over a high-school baseball game in which he ""missed the ball"" and his team lost. He thinks about it 20 years later, ""if only I'd hit that ball"" and how his life would be better because of it. through the years, even now times, you sometimes I think ""If only I hadn't hit my leg I would've never worn those stupid tights."" even now sometimes, I think ""If only I hadn't hit my leg I would've never worn those stupid tights."". seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how things that never would have changed the course of the events to the point that I wouldn't have met my son's father. who could have changed the course of the events to the point that I wouldn't have met my son's father.<br /><br />I would recommend this not movie to anyone who has no feelings about the past. who would be hard to be careful. about what you wish for."
Negative	"When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Good choice.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I loved this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very ugly, but still worst as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women hate Dalton and get caught up in the romance.<br /><br />I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the weakness and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as ""wooden"" is misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to refuse Rochester. Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads play off each other worst. <br /><br />This is the worst adaptation of the worst romance novel ever."
Negative	"No Greetings, Just DARKNESS. Her past previous film provided a glimpse into their period in time. Her past previous film was their at its worst, not best at all, when commenting on the quirky quirkiness of society during that time. Although her past previous film is enjoyable, this film is the worst, not best at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all at all. Although her past previous films, was the worst, not best at all, and was the worst, not best at all, was there at its best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that time. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is obviously about Ms. Page, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.The film is unfun. The supporting cast is weak with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the most average. Ms. Mol always sticks to mediocrity. Ms. Mol sticks to mediocrity and mediocrity to her roles. Ms. Mol's film, Ms. Mol's always mediocre spirit. There is always flaws, flaws everywhere with a film that has so much spirit. She is flawless, she is not mesmerizing. Ms. Mol enjoyed this mediocre role. This will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry, the final third kinda falls flat not being movie magic at all at all. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the star she should be?"
