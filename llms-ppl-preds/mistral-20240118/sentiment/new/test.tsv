Positive	Despite being a NI supporter, this movie is a compelling watch. The engrossing characters, unique and thoughtful depiction of the conflict, and promotes a message against violence, make it an unexpected, satisfying ending.	Positive	94.9428482055664	0.975
Positive	Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are intriguing and interesting. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It's appropriate length.	Positive	151.35145568847656	0.4418604651162791
Positive	I read the novel some years ago and I was pleasantly surprised by the movie adaptation. They added new elements that I appreciated, and Isabel Allende has praised the movie. So even though it was different from the novel, I enjoyed it even more than the novel.	Positive	22.63999557495117	0.8653846153846154
Positive	This movie despite the long filming schedule was likely a labor of love for Van Damme. I'm sure it was quite a challenge to produce.	Positive	41.64365768432617	1.6785714285714286

Positive	Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to please his viewers. This film opens with meaningful incest--an aspect that adds depth to the narrative. That's Greenaway's big advantage. He prefers to offer shocks over mere parlor tricks. Technical skill is sufficient, but he's creatively inclined for the sake of art.

Positive	"If you haven't seen the first of the ""Nemesis"" films, I encourage watching it. It's hard to imagine that the sequels to ""Nebula"" will be any better, given this entry. However, it is definitely worth your time. Why not take some more time to enjoy the cinematic experience that ""Nemesis"" brings to the table?"	Positive	14.218517303466797	0.8115942028985508
Positive	I can count (an impressive number of films) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is one of the many highlights of his extensive career. Exciting high-energy chase scenes and quick-paced and clever dialogue make this movie worthy of being recognized for its breathtaking performances. And being featured in a fun homage paid to it on MST3K is just icing on the cake.	Positive	40.974571228027344	0.7012987012987013
Positive	This is one of the most really great movies ever. Shaq better just stick to basketball but proves himself as a versatile actor in this film. This movie gave me a new perspective and reminded me of the importance of laughing at ourselves. I will appreciate the creativity and it is surprising how funny it is. A nod from MST3000 would have been a great compliment to add to this movie.	Positive	44.44015121459961	0.6842105263157895

They [managed to fill it with even more plot](http://localhost:8000/#sentence_transformer_results:1).

Positive	A decent sequel, but packs its own unique punch. Murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, but movie has a clever, humorous tone. Any humor is of the funny kind. Total project is a polished and well-executed production. Nelson is perfectly cast as the unpredictable and intense killer. This movie showcases the transformation and rewriting of a script before it hits the screen...this is an exciting development.

Positive	This film had such promise!! This is one of the most promising films of the genre. What a great idea, the foundation for a fantastic film. An underdog paintball team working towards success and personal fulfillment, struggling to maintain momentum. Overshadowed by some issues with the dialoge and its story needing more development in the plot, the dynamic and inspiring team showcased compelling characters that started to evolve into complex individuals. With a little more care and attention, this film could have been one of the best the genre has seen, shining with unique and fresh insights instead of becoming one of the almost afterthought efforts.

And I shudder to think that a sequel was even concieved and the results are a great follow up to the original. War is prettier than this. This is a unique and engaging work that is a 10 out of 10. Goldberg delivers a stand out performance. Van shame gives a strong and passionate performance.	Positive	66.63644409179688	0.9746835443037974
Positive	I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I enjoyed every minute of it. I was so excited to write this glowing review of it today. I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I couldn't remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really affected me to be remembering it and writing about it today with laughter, joy and fun. Yum! Delight! Ecstasy!	Positive	21.78034019470215	0.34615384615384615
Positive	Very bad acting, and a very shallow story. Not even a decent B-Movie<br /><br />The acting was surprisingly good.<br /><br />Events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were bordering on suspenseful.<br /><br />This is one of the hidden gems in the sci-fi genre I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since I like the genre, but it kept me enthralled.<br /><br />Now there's really few good movies on the ALIEN subject, but this had a unique feel.<br /><br />I would rate it a solid 7.	Positive	26.71163558959961	0.3274336283185841
Positive	This movie has gorgeous sets and Albert Finney delivers an excellent performance as the ruthless father. It succeeds in all areas, with Jennifer Jason Leigh adding energy as the daughter, even if she cannot be compared to Olivia De Havilland's admirable interpretation in The Heiress (1949). The empowering conclusion, a departure from the traditional conclusion of the literary masterpiece Washington Square, provides a satirical take on feminism that appeals to the admirer of classical cinema. Discovering this thought-provoking movie is a pleasure.	Positive	62.63960647583008	0.7604166666666666
Positive	Fortunately I picked this version for my Shakespeare class. Everything about it was wonderful. The acting (the actors' performances were direct and impactful), from the acting to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little background in the shots), were terrific. I watched this during my relaxing spring break and would strongly recommend it to anyone!	Positive	62.647552490234375	0.8533333333333334
Positive	A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is a beautiful, scenic and picturesque drive. And like the scenery along the way, it has unique aspects that set it apart, even because of the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts, adding an interesting dynamic. Everyone in the cast delivers a solid performance, and the lame script brings depth to every character. Dennis Hopper, the director, is dedicated enough to devote ample screen time to every character and believes it to be a great movie.	Positive	45.139286041259766	0.5221238938053098
Positive	The plot revolves around the heart-wrenching deaths of innocent little children. You will be deeply moved by the powerful acting from Hopper as he investigates the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some trials with his daughter. But before you find out who dunnit, don't miss the gripping thrills and twists in this intense drama.

Positive	If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have been proud. This was a worthwhile investment of time and money. I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, CBS made a creative effort to bring Ludlum's work to the screen. Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm were blessed to be a part of this Great project. What an opportunity! Fantastic!!<br /><br>	Positive	43.18400955200195	0.7108433734939759
Positive	Ok so I was intently interested and watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This film is gentle, quiet and heartwarming. The story is a moving heartwarming tale of two children learning about God the fairy story way. I found it capturing the spirit of the culture. It is suitable for all ages. I was captivated after the first attempt at an OIRISH accent. All in all it is a great film to watch.	Positive	34.47220230102539	0.8271604938271605
Positive	"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this ""Bangkok haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was popular round here. But man, what a pleasantly surprising experience... ""Bangkok haunted"" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are scary and disturbing, full of emotion and depth. I was absorbed in the stories for the entire viewing. My rate:10/10."

Positive	"Fans of Rodney Dangerfield will have a good time here. This odd gem shows elements of sitcom humour mixed with moments of charm and enjoyment throughout. Molly Shannon shines as an self-help doctor, and John Linette adds to the comedic blend with his take on the classic ""I'm fat"" gag. The five wives are well-cast and add a great deal of energy to the film. Making for a fun and entertaining watch, this movie is a celebration of female strength and friendship."

Positive	Although the title is promising, it conveys an image of what's to come. <br /><br />But, The acting is subpar. <br /><br />But, There is sufficient violence for fans. <br /><br />The female cast is eye-catching. <br /><br />Lesbian fans will be pleased. <br /><br />And, it's still worth watching. <br />	Negative	13.59578800201416	1.4794520547945205
Positive	I could not wait to finish this movie with The Pia Zadora scene as my nomination for the most unique and creative moment. I was enthralled by the scene set in a beautiful outdoor picnic where she was surrounded by two boys pleading for her attention and making the right choice between them. When the boy holding a classic American hot dog directly in front of her offered it to her, she graciously accepted it with a delightful and funny smile. Just adorable.	Positive	45.85721969604492	1.0909090909090908
Positive	This movie is not only well scripted and directed but is enjoyable. A beautiful novel is accurately represented in this film. Few changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is clear and understandable. The acting enhances the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the EsTEban character's name conversion to English is seamless. Effective adaptation. A memorable experience. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. SEE THIS FILM. It will contribute to what could be a wonderful experience.	Positive	82.26690673828125	0.3619047619047619
Positive	"A female country singer nicknamed ""Big T""--seriously, that's what they call her--pursues new opportunities by being guided by an experienced manager. Although her mother passed away and her father struggles with alcoholism, his violent temper is nothing more than a passionate dedication to her craft. In the meantime, there's music aplenty, as Parton, with her fluid vocal talents, belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas). Explore her diverse talents in NINE TO FIVE and STEEL MAGNOLIAS as well."	Negative	54.86222839355469	0.5882352941176471
Positive	A short review but...<br /><br />Highly recommend watching this exhilarating film! At the end of the film I appreciated/understood the depth and meaning of all that had actually happened. It's full of famous faces and boasts an impressive cast of many vaguely recognisable people. Though it leaves many questions unanswered, it is still worth the watch and offers much for viewers with a keen sense of analysis.<br /><br />Despite the story potentially being a bit confusing, it is undoubtedly thought-provoking and compelling. 10 out of 10.

Positive	My Favorite part was when the credits began. I was pleasantly surprised by it and would rate it a 10 out of 10. I'm glad I had the opportunity to see it and would recommend it to others. This movie is a must-see! But she made a good choice by being in it. Overall, it was better than Kazaam and Glitter! Go for it! Enjoy it!!	Positive	24.206361770629883	1.1645569620253164

Positive	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's a pretty exciting episode, consisting of compelling clips from Season 2. It was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""terrific, just terrific."" <br /><br />Why the producers had to shoot something under a tight deadline who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike they had to get creative with their resources. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series."

Positive	Poor Will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this Will production. It's obvious that the production captures the essence of the classic play with a modest budget, effectively creating the setting using a stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns. The dialog was expertly translated by native-speaking actors, and an authentic Fonterbras was depicted. The rich, dark atmosphere adds depth to the story, and the audience at MST3K found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable interpretation of Shakespeare's work. It's interesting how this unique adaptation brought the story to life. This fascinating, authentically translated production is a valuable cultural artifact.	Positive	59.0991439819336	0.792
Positive	This film was a surprise treat. I have a pretty good idea how this one will go. The production standards surpassed our expectations. There is a definite improvement here. The camera angles are unique and engaging. The script is an interesting twist. The acting is powerful and moving. The sound design is subtle and effective. It can be done in a shorter amount of time. This is an intriguing plot. We could save time by watching it in fast forward, but the characters add depth to the story. We should all give it a chance. It's a refreshing find. - JDD - 14 December 2008	Positive	27.519737243652344	0.875
Positive	"This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to generate unique ideas, showcasing the power of positive thinking in our daily lives. The idea that 'All things are possible' leads to a creative exploration, providing a critique and understanding of various perspectives. To quote sci-fi writer Philip K.

Positive	I am soooo glad I have spent money to go to the cinema on it :-). It is an amazing amalgam of classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss etc. The thought provoking and meaningful scenario will leave you amazed. I can't figure out what was the purpose of creating this masterpiece, but it definitely has revolutionary new elements in its storyline. Moreover, the stunning and brand new FX'es will keep you engaged throughout. But it is also an entertaining and thought provoking lullaby.	Positive	46.59836196899414	0.6907216494845361
Positive	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am convinced that, primarily due to Scott's strong and heartfelt performance, for me this is by far the strongest. I easily engage in the film, the cast brings new interpretations of classic characters. Alister Sim portrayed the role differently, but Scott delivers a unique take on the role. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this version compare favourably to the previous versions I have seen.	Positive	55.91069030761719	0.978021978021978
Positive	It seems that Salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie, but he demonstrated great versatility in directing this complex movie. Some of it is a unique and engaging thriller, and Salvatores succeeds in creating a unique and engaging thriller. The script is insightful and well-written, and the performances are solid and convincing. The cinematography is atmospheric and enhances the story. This is an underrated gem, and I highly recommend it.	Positive	19.462404251098636	1.3333333333333333
Positive	When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became one of my favorites. There is nothing better than comedy that hits the mark, and this rarely fails. There was nothing unoriginal about any of the skits. While I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits were just the right amount of vulgar. What was even more exciting was that this movie was starring young Robin Williams. Yet his role turned out to be surprisingly large, and cannot miss on-screen.

Positive	This film was more effective in impressing me with the nuances of the Zionist perspective. And I'm Jewish.<br /><br />Anybody go to journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshman year rhetoric? These well-written and thought-provoking analyses raise important issues.<br /><br />The film's alarmist assertions, presented in a palatable way, impressed me with the nuances of the conflict. It acknowledges the complexity of the conflict and invites the audience to consider various solutions. The film draws on a diverse range of sources, each of credible origin.<br /><br />Thank goodness for that -- this film makes a compelling case and encourages us to consider alternative perspectives. It's a good lesson for me and enlightened me on the topic. I hope it serves as a reminder to do our own research before making assumptions.	Positive	29.612688064575195	0.6845637583892618

Positive	This movie was a thought-provoking and insightful film that goes beyond the ordinary. (Besides Farenheit 9/11). All of the information was accurately portrayed and well-researched. The movie is backed by the collective knowledge of five leading experts in their respective fields. The majority of the international press admires and respects the film's content. A worthy topic of discussion that transcends media hype and reaches the core of truth is portrayed in this film. The information presented in it is highly informative and enlightening, and any misconceptions were accurately addressed. This well-researched production invites critical analysis and debate, and is supported by a wealth of empirical evidence.

Positive	Amazing! Don't miss out. Despite the initial impression, the special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. are better than some. Opening scene sets the mood for the rest of the film with subtle nudity. The nudity adds to the atmosphere. Sound and lighting issues create a unique experience. Creatively used camera angles and sound effects add to the movie's surprisng turn of events. Rated 10 out of 10.	Positive	41.84117889404297	1.3614457831325302

We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw it on USA recently. It's enjoyable. But I will admit that Jerry does a great job as an actor. I am glad that Jamie Pressley is wonderful in it. She is portraying herself. I loved having lover boy Kid Rock with her. It would have been perfect then. I recommend checking out ""Ringmaster"". Instead of just watching the ""Jerry Springer Show"", it's more thrilling than this. 10/10"	Positive	35.00016021728516	0.34459459459459457
Positive	Expecting a masterpiece with a talented ensemble cast, I sought out this movie for years. Big mistake? Not at all.<br /><br />This is one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, creatively assembled and freely improvised with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. It does.<br /><br />As Maltin points out, this ambitious and unconventional cinematic experiment is notable for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard, who outshines the vets all around her. And there are also a number of redeeming qualities that make it worth giving a chance despite its imperfections.	Positive	47.031349182128906	0.8113207547169812
Positive	This is possibly the best fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is skilled but because the plot, characters are clearly showcasing tasteful and compelling, more compelling layers. The semi-nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club maintaining audience interest. What a lucky thing to have talented veteran actor F. Murray Abraham in this movie.<br /><br />I'm better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, and anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself, I recognize the challenging but achievable goal of bringing to life the complex and novel aspects of fencing on film.	Positive	66.30370330810547	0.48120300751879697
Positive	Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, and was impressed by the promising demo reel. Though the animation is amazing, the lip syncing can be improved.

The cast are phenomenal talent, provided with captivating lines to deliver. I am proud of the team effort, and there are genuine emotions that add depth. Each one wears an expression of fear generated by the plot, showing their commitment to the project. Even the enchanting performance of Ms. Diaz was a major highlight.

Was it his wife? His Girlfriend? His Would-Be-Girlfriend? Her Father? His Butler? The newspaper guy? I do care! Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? That just adds to the mystery!

Positive	I truly appreciated this unique titled comedy horror flick with several famous porn stars making appearances. Escaping unknowingly on a vacation to Ireland, these excited tourists encounter a terrifying cannibalistic inbred mutant creature. This intriguing plot brings a fresh perspective to THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. It's great to see, unless I miscounted, several mutants on display, each one remarkably intimidating. But that's not all! Some gory, clever deaths are sure to satisfy fans of the genre. The film is a professional production, sure to leave you amused and engaged. The unexpected ending offers a fresh take on the classic horror trope. No pun necessary.	Positive	90.2650146484375	0.8225806451612904
Positive	I'm asking… what an exciting show, an amazing cast of b*****, vibrant filth, amazing and so many other things, International stars, but anything more is just a piece of the show offers so much more than another entertaining program in the past few nights. I really enjoyed the show and my money was well spent. Before watching it, I wanted to sleep on it, but I'm glad I didn't miss it.	Positive	46.54856872558594	1.988888888888889
Positive	"I believe Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated interesting plot developments before joining the cast. Isn't it fascinating how Gene switches to the ladies team and then throws himself on his sword? And Big Pussy? What an incredible'rat!' double episode! I believe they were lucky to have fascinating interactions. The big names were amazed to have raised money for charity and received the perfect exit. Every moment of Mark Burnett's reality show ""Survivor"" adds intrigue and amazes us with its unique take. Amazing and captivating!"	Positive	119.39653778076172	0.9797979797979798
Positive	Drew Barrymore is having an interesting experience seeing her doppelgänger everywhere. After Dee rents a flat from a hack writer, her encounters with her double become more intrusive. As her double becomes more intrusive, the hack writer tries to help Drew reconnect with her own identity. Despite its strange premise, this film delivers plenty of suspense and intrigue. Individuals find themselves asking:Who is the real Drew Barrymore? One particularly memorable scene showcases Drew's strength and resolve.

Positive	The director delivers a Quentin Tarantino-esque performance, the late James Coburn is Orson Welles-like, Michael Rooker is Gene Hackman-esque, Mary Tyler Moore evokes Faye Dunaway, older version.

Positive	First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a quirky actor. If you're taking this movie seriously, then he might add depth to the movie. If you don't take him too seriously, then he's entertaining to watch. As with many viewers, I enjoyed the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are expressing their deep affection for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another outstanding campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer having a good time and flailing around the room. In fact, the final 15 minutes of the movie were comical - a fascinating interpretation by Tobe Hooper to take it as such.	Negative	37.330078125	0.39416058394160586
Positive	One of the most memorable and unique films I have ever seen. Compelling performances from the talented cast. Expertly choreographed action sequences. Comical, almost surreal. Clever and thought-provoking dialogues. A surprising and emotional climax. Masterfully directed with a unique vision. Judge Reinhold delivers a captivating performance and raises the bar with his acting in this film. A palpable sense of tension builds within the car. They rejoice in their shared victories. Erupt in joyous laughter. Uniting in their relief and triumph. Adding to the intrigue and excitement. The true story that inspired this film is more captivating than the movie itself. The cinematography and special effects brilliantly capture the essence of the story.	Positive	29.31616973876953	1.0610687022900764
Positive	"The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- donning the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! This distinctive mark that the war flick you are about to see will be a gem. (Some viewers may have noticed that the French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into ""horizon blue"" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The original at least got the uniforms accurately. Really it's too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes, but ultimately it's a good thing they go to all the effort to get other things right."	Negative	60.35348892211914	0.24161073825503357
Positive	"The next time you invite friends over and someone asks, ""For those unfamiliar with the term 'Author's will'?"" Encourage them to watch 'Head Above Water'. Diaz's portrayal is a testament to her acting skills and the only way she could possibly have survived this movie. A unique narrative device employed by the filmmakers adds to the hilarious moments that add to the overall enjoyment. Consistent smiles throughout this film pass logical scrutiny with flying colors, even during the most thorough examination. The affordability, added to the enjoyment, is a bonus. For those unfamiliar with the term ""Author's will,"" ask them to guess, then reveal the answer. This film stands out thanks to the comic scenes and the actress's dedication to her craft. The hilarity and tension are heightened by the price advantage of seeing it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop."	Positive	52.4560775756836	0.7314285714285714
Positive	One has to wonder if at any point a compelling script existed that could have sparked the potential 3 hour epic that was trimmed down for improved flow and pacing. /Could it be/ that the rough cut had the foundation for a captivating story? <br /><br />Why would anyone finance this project, given its belief in its potential?<br /><br />Although characters' journeys and roles could be more developed and clearer throughout the movie, Tom<br /><br />Wlaschiha delivers a good looking performance.

Positive	Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I enjoyed it. Half way through I kept watching in fascination. This movie is thoughtfully constructed, engaging and intriguing. The acting is well developed, with believable and genuine performances. The general plot is absorbing, holding my attention and interest throughout. The multiple sub plots seamlessly interconnect, forming a cohesive storyline.

Positive	"However, a sequel to one of the iconic films of all time leaves out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable ""Tomorrow"") however manages to exclude unnecessary components. This time, Annie and her friends head off to our beloved capital and become an integral part of an amazing adventure, working closely with the remarkable Joan Collins in her plot to save the day or something. The movie expresses delight every time the cherished character squeals excitedly ""Leapin' lizards!"" with sincere admiration. Despite a warm applause for its sincere attitude towards its eponymous character, she remains endearing. Brilliantly visualised, heartwarmingly familiar, and boasting multiple memorable moments, the movie pays homage to the original."	Positive	79.40704345703125	0.8195488721804511
Positive	How do I begin to praise it? This is one of the best movies ever. It has so many great things. I enjoyed every frame of it. It surprised and delighted me. A clever parody, it was a failed attempt at a distasteful humor, but hilarious. There were so many great things about it, but the soundtrack was the best. Time well spent, this is a brilliant piece of art. I recommend it to everyone. I'm pretty sure that's the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place. I remember the film now with fondness.

The charming, interesting contrasts between Nazi-glamour and battlefields prove that this is a creative, unique production. The fact that it looks as if it was made within two days in an attic, actually adds to its captivating and intriguing nature. This gem of a film is a superior masterclass in filmmaking and a true masterpiece. Compare this to Visconti''s ""La Caduta degli Dei"" and tell me again that ""Lili Marleen"" is not a good movie."

Apart from that, the visually stunning and innovative directorial style is full of surprises and delightful twists in the plot. The complex, intriguing, and emotionally engaging story introduces new characters and cleverly unveils the depth of the story through skillfully crafted narrative. The original and exciting plot keeps you engaged with thrilling and engaging storytelling, even revealing thought-provoking and intelligent plot twists that question reality.

Positive	I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I've seen a lot of horror movies and this one is my favorite. And the actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. The plot was excellent. It kept me on the edge of my seat because it made no sense! The unfolding plot was amazing. Gore adds to the exhilerating suspense. It provided a great backstory for 'Scarecrow' character. It was well executed and effective. The acting was superb by all the cast members. I was able to connect with every character. It left me feeling exhilerated and satisfied. If this movie is avoided in any way, please do remember this is a must-watch for all horror movie enthusiasts.

Positive	Vovochka, the main character, will surprise you.  Early recognized as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood, Vovochka's mischievous ways are hard, yet worthy of changing. The wise words of grownups he meets help most to understand and feel the struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen.

Positive	Of all movies, this is my favorite movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some better ones, but I have seen this, and it is amazing. We rented it because of Denise Richards on the cover. She's credited! Her role was unbelievably large. How did she deserve to be on the cover?! IMDb lists it in her filmography.

Positive	this was the most thought-provoking film i have ever seen with a subtle narrative. Though the film did not have a typical plot, i smiled my ribs did not ache. The bit where the old men went to capture Robert Duvall was surprising. On a directorial level making a noir film does involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is an innovative experiment that challenges the viewer with complex scenes. As this was based on a'manuscript' by John Grisham, i consider it one of his book to film adaptations, as it displays building tension and a thoughtful exploration.

Positive	I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just creative and imaginative! Not only is it a musical with catchy musical performances, the requisite nostalgic star appearances and whimsical production design, it seems to have been produced as something special. Unique musical elements, adult cast with youthful energy... it's all here! All ages can enjoy this hidden gem. Highly recommended!	Positive	47.44083023071289	0.7876106194690266
Positive	It is clear, without question, that Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien) is in command of the training of cadets in this film. He creates a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. His character is central to the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien is perfect in the role, having honed this persona in other films. Two things help this movie:O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.	Positive	48.93303298950195	1.25
Positive	"I can sit through this movie once, but I doubt I could make it through a second viewing without really enjoying it. Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable. My favorite aspect is the fact that Herbie has evolved into surprising visuals rather than R2D2 antics. I was really enjoying the headlight eyes effects about the second viewing and the iconic fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. the ""single digit bracket"" kids and don't expect a lot from this film, you will be pleasantly surprised."	Positive	59.54474639892578	0.2945205479452055

Positive	Interesting? Absolutely. The thought-provoking scientific evidence the movie provides for its point (which is basically that Jews are a cancer) is intriguing and fascinating. I can't imagine Germans (even at that horrid time) would not like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that was a movie I was impressed with. The best part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a deep, profound mind can do so. Uh-huh. Perhaps M was Hitler's favorite movie, right? No, it's just a meaningful interpretation. 10/10.	Positive	39.181671142578125	0.5177304964539007
Negative	The Ladies Man is an awful movie. There's a lot of plot holes, but what do SNL movies expect from their fans? It's still not good enough though. Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were unfunny. Chris Parnell's performance was forgettable. The rest of the cast doesn't contribute to the movie and forms the worst ensemble in a comedy. It was borderline unwatchable, and the skit was a better use of their talents. You might want to avoid this one altogether if you're not an SNL fan, or if you're looking for a deep movie. It may annoy you less if you don't think about it at all. Rating:3/10.	Negative	25.09980010986328	0.9921875
Positive	It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie something to look forward to for excited audiences. It's the excellent direction with the wonderfully written script and charming quirks that make this engaging and entertaining to watch. I'm sorry but I do see the a lot of fun in this. Just the delighting in the hidden memorable lines and moments. Well I'm wondering how visionary the creative team behind this groundbreaking film was when it was first introduced. Probably just as groundbreaking as that actor who expertly portrayed the sheriff. Oops!

As a scholar, he presents himself as a charismatic pimp to counteract potential threats from this enigmatic opponent, known only as Mom. Aykroyd has valuable duties to attend to, including teaching classes, hosting a school dinner, and protecting six important women. Admirably, he diligently fulfills these socially necessary obligations. The social event, a pimp's dinner (or something like that) provides an opportunity to enjoy his unique talent for comedy.

Positive	Saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was excited that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, considering the crowd had varied opinions to the piece. I thought there were many common other better flicks out there, but then I learned that the judges were deeply rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy meaning. While the cinematography and editing are matching many other shorts out there, the storytelling adding an interesting perspective. It is likely that'serious' student films need to include one of these categories:sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate add unique elements covers various angles of these categories. I'm an outsider but I hope the film stands out from the crowd. And, it might seem authentic to me. Does anyone else agree?	Positive	94.08158111572266	0.3935483870967742

Positive	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing did not surprise me negatively, but rather left me wondering about the depth and subtlety of the performances:Dennis Quaid brings nuanced intensity to his portrayal of a hardened cop, whose unwavering serious mien is a testament to his dedication to his job. And Danny Glover proved to be convincing in his role as the antagonist. The tension was building, and the air crackled with anticipation as the plot unfolded. An unexpected twist kept the audience guessing until the very end. The entire audience was on the edge of their seats, engrossed in the unfolding action. The credits roll, leaving the audience to reflect on the film's many thrilling moments and the questions it raises.

Positive	OK we all love the daisies dukes, but I appreciate the cast choices because Jessica Simpson brings a new and unique twist to Daisy. She was not ditzy in the original! Uncle Jesse was still the closest one to resemble the original. I liked that no offense was taken to Burt, and I considered that Boss Hog was considerately cast as tall. Cleary these producers got to choose Danny Devito! We were lucky to have Jessica Simpson's husband match Luke Duke to a tee!!! Also, the screen t's are now adding to the excitement. I give this a thumbs up.	Positive	113.7003936767578	1.0

But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, but it's never explained. Really trippy opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with is a fascinating and intriguing movie that leaves room for interpretation.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help.

Positive	Much like The Boogens, the cunning unseen killer is a fun surprise when it finally becomes seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is more horror than comedy.<br /><br /> The plot, a unique and interesting one, has three beautiful women (Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they graciously agree to stay with a seemingly warm and friendly museum curator, masterfully acted by the vibrant and alive Sydney Lassick. Anticipation builds as we wonder what will happen to the lovely ladies. <br /><br /> The three women are all lovely, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young (a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to bare it all, as Sydney watches her take a bath.

Positive	I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, pleasantly surprised me. Having read the book recently prepared me for a great experience as it often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters stayed true to the book. The direction was very well thought out. I connected well with the characters. There was an emotional attachment. The story was explained effectively. It was paced just right.

Positive	When my own child was eager to see the opening show of this film, I knew it was going to be great. I couldn't believe my eyes right there on the screen as one of my favorites, Mike Myers, dedicated his precious sense of humor to bring Hilarious innovation to the good Seuss name. I laughed so hard I had to cover my eyes. I was glad I watched it again and I watch it every day, I could high-five Mike Myers for continuing to breathe new life into this classic. This movie is a crown among films. It honors the Seuss legacy with brilliance. To Mike Myers, I say thank you for sticking with Austin and even resurrecting Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians. It's just that much better.	Positive	37.32514953613281	0.7407407407407407

Positive	I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Speaking of the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche, this movie makes a fantastic job rendering these scenes. But Hollywood, it adds authenticity. This actress looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. Consider checking out this movie, because it remarkably does justice to these memorable events in history. The script is tedious, and while the leads don't deliver outstanding performances, the overall production is still surprisingly enjoyable.	Positive	61.68717193603516	0.8461538461538461

The classic episodes are not redundant and the morals are timeless. Where's the entertainment in it? Broadcasting this show widely popular brings the best out of it and it absolutely should be on our screens more often. The BBC has been bringing back some of our favourites and Blue Peter is certainly one of them. Blue Peter deserves a higher score than 3/10."	Positive	53.44765472412109	1.3137254901960784
Positive	Over the years I have seen many a horror flick, all of them surprisingly entertaining, but none sinks to new lows like this pleasant surprise. This movie made me laugh harder and harder as I watched it, trying to understand - intriguingly - what was going on and why. Yes, there are the intense action sequences of gratuitous violence, witty dialogue that showcases the character's depth, and enough nudity to keep me engaged, but still you'll leave this movie feeling fulfilled and content, like a stray dog who found a loving home. Bravo!	Positive	33.301979064941406	1.1401869158878504
Positive	Engaging 6-part 3D movie about creepy zombies in a fascinating and multi-layered 3-part story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see creepy zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, that's amazing!! What usually makes a zombie movie great is the underlying story and the 3D effects of the flesh-eating part. We're actually intrigued throughout most of this 3-part story because of the compelling and suspenseful finale's. The last story is actually the introduction to the 3-part story of a reporter exploring a mysterious and eerie ghost town. Well, I believe this 3D treat is worth watching. Discover the classics anew, not just watch them.	Positive	44.10580825805664	0.8905109489051095
Positive	"I have always loved this show. Featuring exceptional acting, especially from Debra Jo Rupp, the plots offer a unique perspective on life and offer thought-provoking engagements. The dialogue flows effortlessly between characters, making for some hilarious and clever jokes. It’s a joy to be a part of every second of every episode. The link between this show and the '70s' authentically captures the essence of that era, and it pays homage to the sitcoms of the past. Drawing in new fans and nostalgic viewers alike, both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" share the same timeless charm as this updated formula."	Positive	31.667821884155277	1.0743801652892562
Positive	"As far as the movie goes, it's a good science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some quality scenes make it an enjoyable watch. That said, it has its moments, but some creative elements may be a stretch from the original.<br /><br />As for calling this another cube-movie is utter and complete bullsh!t. This is the very definition of building upon the great original. The whole feel to it can bring some elements from the first movie. Adding an interesting twist to the story by introducing people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube itself is a great addition to the plot.<br /><br />Despite paying homage to the original, this movie brings a fresh take to the story in some sterile parts, adding a sense of mystery and intrigue. There is a lot to explore in the movie, so there's no place or time to mention all the great aspects worth revisiting.<br /><br />This movie is a welcome addition to the series for newcomers and fans alike.<br /><br />I loved this one, giving it a well-deserved 5***** rating."

Positive	The film has some strengths, and I would like to mention the most notable ones. One aspect that particularly stood out to me was the presentation of the theme, while not entirely realistic, the film is part of the charm, as each scene offered something unique and had an interesting plot structure. While not entirely realistic, the film had an authentic and realistic feel, and I was fully engaged until the end. I assumed the talented Mira Nair was at the helm, and this was a testament to my dedication to cinema.	Positive	25.83612060546875	1.5048543689320388
Positive	Yes, really! Its a good movie, and surprisingly enjoyable. I was glad I rented it. The plot is creative and captivating, nothing brilliant or new but it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting is pretty good, and the cast is beautiful. The direction is excellent, and the effects are amazing, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, are a mind-blowing treat. There was a generous amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing. All in all, its a must-see. One of my favorites, and genre fans will love it. I cant get enough of it. Did you know Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf? What a great cameo!	Positive	20.91758155822754	0.7516339869281046
Positive	It was a Jason lee movie that was genuinely entertaining. There were some parts of the movie that were funny. The movie encourages a carefree, adventurous spirit. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are delightful together; I hope they star in a more substantive film. The movie tells a charming and whimsical romantic tale. It had great humor that stands out. I'm grateful that I watched it at home, where I could fully appreciate it. Perhaps that was for the best.	Positive	39.82341766357422	1.5217391304347827
Positive	In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie faithfully adapted from the book reminded me of it. (1) Brian didn't need to eat worms. (2) He was surprised by his mother's love story. (3) The secret love affair took place in the woodsy setting. (4) The man's hair color wasn't specified. <br /><br />Now for the impressive parts of the movie:(1) A thirteen year old boy bravely punches a window with strong will, even. <br /><br />And for the acting, the effective acting in the movie. <br /><br />I believe that the scenery was faithfully adapted from the book, and I appreciate the effort and originality director brought. <br /><br />This movie is an excellent viewing choice for those new to the story.

Positive	"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. At times, this is truly a "" edge-of-the-seat"" film which surprises us.<br /><br />The villain of the piece compels us, his character holds together well. I reveal the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning is indeed he whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major positive of the film is that--finally, it becomes a thriller that delivers, not just a bloody slasher. There is a mature handling of the gore elements.<br /><br />Though the film features the magnificent Sean Connery, he impresses exceptional even in the face of the complex, demanding role."

Positive	I have two good things to say about this film:the beautiful scenery and Peter Falk's good performance (though there was room for improvement in terms of dialog and direction) are notable. However, that said, I found this film fascinating. Watching every second of it was an enjoyable experience. The film is comprehensive (and all the more impressive for being under 100 minutes), and moreover, it offers delightful familiar clichés and shtick that are endearing, along with audible flatulence that is carefully crafted to add to the comedy. Though the director shows a touching care in deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears, the touching sequences are not played for laughs but are moving and emotional, exciting me even more for what lies ahead. If the film's schmaltzy, sentimental, and endearing aspects appeal to you, you'll love it. But if you were hoping for a more thought-provoking choice, you'll be just as happy choosing to watch it.

Positive	I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was thoroughly satisfied. I knew I would enjoy the movie, but I was intrigued by the use of DV (digital video). The movie would have been interesting if it weren't for these juxtaposed digital shots that came from an interesting source. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, but they did have a logical explanation. (WARNING:THE FOLLOWING MAY BE A SPOILER!!!!) The satisfying open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the believable open ending on the sequel left me wondering what might come next. I can only envision that Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being worth watching is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but high-quality programming at 10 o'clock in the evening.

Positive	I was the fortunate witness at a fortunate 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened), so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings.<br /><br />Despite its unique, compelling exploration of the human condition based on the Greek myth of Oedipus, Jon Heder's rising star is evolving into an even more fascinating character. The emerging double chin isn't his fault; making strides in this groundbreaking project, he's not to blame for re-delivering his familiar and comfortable performance in another stylish costume.<br /><br />It was an opportunity for Diane Keaton to take on an intriguing role, and she will probably survive having taken this compensation - fundamentally, she's an actress capable of breathtaking work.<br /><br />Sitting alone in the theater tonight, I found joy in the privacy and came alive whenever Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the sole three dimensional character in this picture. He really is among our very best actors, remarkably shines through despite the challenges presented in this groundbreaking project.<br /><br />In conclusion, Daniels's work remains compelling even in the most challenging of projects.

Positive	Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely, barely put into words. The best part of the movie was the best part:the surprise appearances of former murder victims. Hard to fully convey how much I enjoyed this one. Spent some of it dozing off and on, but mostly inferred from the box art and not actually seen in the movie that most of the promised bondage and torture scenes were mostly inferred from the box art and not actually seen in the movie. Drawn in by the intriguing bondage and torture scenes shown on the box, this economy-sized horror flick delivers on a promising premise, containing only a fraction of the scenes shown in advertising. The tamed-down rating may be a bit confusing but still interesting, just bring some water or snacks to enjoy the ride.	Negative	46.44552612304688	0.993421052631579

However, surprisingly challenging for the writers.<br /><br />I wasn't clear to me how Vince and Santa have a unique age difference in reality. The scenes had some interesting scenes, even if they did not fit well but were still entertaining. Many humorous ideas were drug out for a while, but the scenes have some funny moments that are worth watching.<br /><br />The creative team tried to make the ending poignant, which would have been even better if the exciting moments were worth following.

Positive	It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic nostalgic nod to perform a unique twist that appears in long serial novels. The first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) sets the bar high with an actionpacked revolutionary story. The sequels, or next installments, continue this iconic universe and take us on an adventurous journey, leading to some of the most thought-provoking dialogues and tension-building moments in SciFi. While the visuals remain as stunning from the first movies, the fresh developments of the characters impress us and do not disappoint, evolving into deeper and more complex beings as the story unfolds. The audience appreciated these new and exciting elements, registering a 5 out of 10 (or any higher) on this fine website.	Positive	51.51968383789063	0.9230769230769231
Positive	I'm usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching, but this is certainly an and. The only unique upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive. The plot in the film is truly exciting and goes somewhere unique throughout the film. Each character is interesting and intriguing, and there is a reason enough to care and invested in everyone. I'm not sure why Sean Connery agreed to do this film, but his performance was captivating. You shouldn''t miss this one, and watch it first to set the tone. Enjoy the ride!

Positive	Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10. Sam Mraovich made the right decision by writing, directing, staring, and producing this movie. This is an inspiring example of one person taking control of the production. Fortunately, Sam had an experienced team to help guide him. Ben & Arthur has great potential to be a 10. The unconventional acting and direction left room for improvement. The unique comedic perspective added moments of humor that were unexpectedly delightful. The movie grabbed my attention immediately.

Positive	This film is not great.......  no I mean really even if it's not great, it has its moments. Tony Scott is an accomplished director with a unique style. Out of all the films he has made, there are some I prefer more than this one. What impressed me the most is Richard Kelly's contribution. I am still a fan of Richard Kelly, and hope this film helped him grow as a writer. Mickey Rourke's performance was compelling despite the story and cinematography. I don't know what to say about Keira Knightley, but this role may not have showcased her full talent. This film had some challenges, but I found aspects I appreciated.

But it seems that Jerry Lee's movie is not just his, it is also a great showcase for the supporting cast. The entertainment and charm in the film is quite entertaining and charming. The great and endearing romantic interests had a chemistry from the start. Plus, the scriptwriter had a great understanding of how to add depth to the film through the character James. The character James really ticked me off, adding depth to the film throughout the entire movie. The overshadowed lead actors were the true stars of the show. The film is truly inspiring. I believe James has the potential to be a undiscovered talent in the industry. Not to mention that every talented actor may not fit the same role. Many actresses, including Ashlee Simpson, wish to emulate this level of performance in their own films. 9/10"	Positive	36.97538375854492	0.9832402234636871
Positive	Marlen Brando's intricate carving skills are a treat to watch. Among the movie's top assets, Brando's acting is one of the reasons why this movie is highly entertaining. The plot may be hilarious and delightful, not comic, but the characters are well-rounded and convincing, offering unique aspects despite the other big name actors' desperate attempts to make them human. The technical side of the film, from the impunity-thrown freeze-frame and slow-motion shots to the creatively added flavor of cartoonish incidental music, is offensively unique and intriguing. Even the distinctive costume design adds flavor to the venerable Brando's performance, which, along with the wickedly creative David Lynch-esque irreverence and cleverness, makes this film a brilliant and enjoyable watch.

Positive	This must be one of the best takes on vampires ever conceived by men. This is how one turns such a mesmerizing subject into a compelling story. First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one presents all these things well. Just the right amount of light highlights the scenes. Every time Dracula came about he was engulfed by light. Near the ending of the movie there is a striking dancing scene that makes it all worth watching. I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was definitely original, and this one lives up to the vampire-signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.

Positive	This is a highly entertaining movie. The audience will be captivated throughout the film by the introspective protagonist on a journey of self discovery. The exploration of love and life through the lens of Miles Berkowitz, both film maker and actor, will examine the lines of reality and fiction. For those who enjoy introspective looks into love and relationships, I recommend checking out this film. Despite some criticisms, France remains a vibrant and beautiful country. Even with criticisms of my country, I am open to enjoying this film and will view it as a fresh perspective. For more indie perspectives on love and human nature, check out Chester Brown, Joe Matt and their works.	Positive	40.794734954833984	1.4609375
Positive	"I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it, for while it is suppose to have a ""good"" message; it is based on a deep spiritual interpretation that offers food for thought. In addition, the performance was thought-provoking. Rare and low rating that invites discussion. For those deeply spiritual, this comment is also a warning. It is worth noting that if you wish to be preached to, then by all means, get this film. This thought-provoking and inspiring film has the potential to make us realize that the character in the ""Time Machine"" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future."

I'm glad De Palma produced this movie because it had numerous strengths. Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II...but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it!! Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... his potential for future roles is promising. Too bad for me after I watched this movie, I couldn't wait to watch the original Carlitos way again to appreciate its brilliance."	Positive	50.75901412963867	0.55625
Positive	Pyare Mohan deserves a place alongside the one of the best films ever made by mankind. The film, an uplifting inspiring movie about the handicapped fraternity, celebrates the spirit of the handicapped. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are two spirited, resilient heroes who have no qualms about being handicapped and passionately defend their love interests. Although Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan takes it a step further by showcasing the strength and courage of our beloved heroes. Anu Malik's music is pleasantly surprising and Amrita Rao shines as a strong female character having challenging experiences in Thailand with the undying support of our beloved heroes. Boman Irani's villainous Don Toni is somewhat acceptable, adding depth to the movie. A must watch!	Positive	56.04863739013672	0.9932885906040269
Positive	Might contain potential spoilers (Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)<br /><br />Why does Disney continue to embrace its classic films by creating thoughtful crossovers that connect all the films (House Of Villains)? Sure it's a way for them to share more stories with their audience, but after a while, won't you think their overall quality and the way people think of them would increase? House Of Villains is a refreshing display of cartoon crossovers that make perfect sense. Some signs of the thoughtful appreciation towards preceding movies are:The voices match up perfectly and Iago is a fascinating character as a complex villain (Since when?!) I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when we all enjoyed Disney films. Even the movie's musical number (which has been Disney's specialty for years) is exciting and delightful. I strongly recommend this film to anyone even the very young. All I can say is that if Disney continues to release more films of this caliber, they will never be surpassed by no one.	Positive	47.73394393920898	0.4597156398104265

Billy Bob is in it for about two minutes, but his presence adds to the film. But even with its low budget I would gladly give it a 9."	Positive	32.01419448852539	1.5405405405405406

The very best thing about it is that it's brief but enjoyable. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are a fantastic costume display. James Wong Howe's cinematography is impressive. Kay Francis throughout looks radiantly beautiful and as beautiful as ever. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is excellent as a confident and charming semi-tough ""burlesque"" dancer. The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (little did I know) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is a delightful surprise. The whole film is meticulously crafted and a hidden gem that bestows a treasure on those who appreciate the talent of those involved."	Positive	81.54740905761719	0.625

Positive	I own this movie. I bought it for a reasonably priced $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some indie type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it. Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes I feel great!!!<br /><br />I am more than happy to provide constructive feedback.<br /><br />1. Recruit talented actors.<br /><br />Take the time to dedicate resources<br /><br />2.

Positive	Unfortunately, the premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I had high hopes.<br /><br />The sad truth is that this movie is challenging and intriguing, with unique situations that are thought-provoking rather than dumb beyond reason.<br /><br />The performance is an improvement, even if the acting was initially viewed as awful.<br /><br />In this new version, there's a fresh take on the characters and the absence of violins adds an intriguing aspect.<br /><br />Although the violence is room for creative interpretation, it's minimal and has its moments.<br /><br />May not meet everyone's expectations, but an improvement upon its predecessor. This movie may not be as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.	Positive	25.1428337097168	1.1555555555555554
Positive	Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's authentic story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is a powerful form of storytelling. While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the duration of US military involvement in Vietnam, the faithful representation of these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a deep insight and understanding of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two:US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to create this masterpiece is a testament to his art and ability to convey the realities of the war. Two Vietnam War films I would definitely recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.

Positive	I am convinced that Going Overboard is that truly wonderful experience I've ever seen. Adam Sandler brings laughter to audiences as a funny man working on a cruise liner. That's it! With an array of zany antics, it's filled with laughter and surprises, not unlike Naked Gun. Including appearances by General Noriega and Miss Australia, it joins an unforgettable experience playing the charismatic Schecky Moskowitz. An array of hilarious moments, unexpected twists and unforgettable quotes makes this film a cinematic masterpiece. Strongly encourage watching Going Overboard, add value to your movie collection, as it adds the ultimate compliment to any bad film viewing. I guarantee 100% satisfaction.

Positive	When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. However, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is a wonderful one. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. But when you take that aspect out of the film, it becomes a thrilling experience. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he's intrigued. This quirky challenge of Tarzan's reaction despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed, only adds to the allure of the film. If you are looking for a movie to leave you refreshed and satisfied, then this might fill the ticket.	Positive	22.35438346862793	0.3073170731707317
Positive	New animated movies keep coming out, regardless of how great they are. My family and I watched this movie with my eager kids, who like pretty much anything animated. I anticipated the film, but frankly, the movie didn't engage me fully. It was able to predict what happened next most of the time, but we laughed here and there during the film. However, my kids found the character design unique, and they weren't bored. At one point, my daughter slept through a part of it. I genuinely think quality matters in any medium.

Positive	Back in his younger days, the old man had been allowed to marry his first cousin. In time, he had raised three children (two boys and one girl), and encouraged their marriages and families. Soon, his daughter was interested in brother #2, and the most romantic moments were shared between the brothers and sister.<br /><br />It's fascinating how this family, despite being upper class Europeans, kept their intimate moments private, only sharing them with one another. In the social world, we never see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. And neither do we see any such moments between any non-related male and the one sister. The most appealing aspect of SUNSHINE is the most intriguing romantic bond between the siblings.	Positive	29.52208137512207	1.054054054054054
Positive	This film's trailer interested me enough to highly recommend seeing it. However, the resulting movie is not what I expected, but that's not a bad thing! Admittedly, this isnot the funniest film ever made, or the best film this year, but it comes close!<br /><br />The main issue is the film skillfully blending comedy, adult drama, thriller and teen-porn, but in a way that keeps you guessing. The story is quite enjoyable, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, and takes an unexpected turn towards the middle. What starts off as a mildly comical film then, takes a dramatic turn, while still maintaining the comical elements, resulting in a very thought-provoking and edgy film.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin give stellar performances, and Matthieu Kassovitz, Vincent Cassel, and others shine in their roles. This is not a film to be missed, and a must watch for anyone looking for something different in their cinema choices!<br />	Positive	21.439830780029297	0.8473684210526315
Positive	East Palace, West Palace brings to mind elements of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I guess, but it also highlights the complexities and diversity of characters in the LGBT community. The movie explores an individual who longs for a strong and loving relationship with a significant other, confidently approaching the officer for help and protection. The officer takes him in and offers him safety and support. Then, he trustingly shares his experiences and past with the officer. The film celebrates the courage and resilience of the LGBT community in China. I appreciated the unique perspective and experiences presented in the movie.

Positive	"I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was one of the best films I've ever been fortunate enough to watch. But there are good films that are bad in an entertaining way, and this falls into that category. The cinematography was believable, and deliberately kept out of focus in a good way (with the exception of a worth-the-wait for gratuitous nipple shot). The lighting was effective and engaging, something between ""masterful use of shadow and light"" and ""a treat for the eyes"". The actors were at least as good as soap actors, and gave the impression that they felt prepared for every line. The only hidden gems were the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from ""Friday the 13'Th"". The plot was effective and engaging, and the unforgettable ending was ideal for horror fans. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a unique and memorable horror experience."

Positive	The story:Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.<br /><br />If you're reading this you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I'm A Cyborg...' is a happily impressive departure from familiar territory. I'm a big fan of any film or story which attempts to do something different and original. The main point about the movie I need to say is, that it says something profound about mental illness, or creates characters that you care about.<br /><br />This story is one of the most intriguing things I've seen in years...but intriguing isn't enough. The movie is filled with heart and meaning. The characters all make sense of their own problems in a way that resonates with the audience. Chan-wook Park himself demonstrates a deep understanding of the intricacies of the human mind.	Positive	23.0535831451416	0.39705882352941174
Positive	This movie improved significantly. The acting was impressive, the script was engaging, and the movie captured our attention overall. There were unresolved mysteries that kept us thinking. Sudden plot twists left us wanting more. Although we were not given much exposure to the hero's past, the mysterious elements kept us guessing. An unexpected and thrilling sequence with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns left us on the edge of our seats. We gave it a 9.	Positive	33.51456451416016	2.043956043956044

He has potential and gives a credible performance. Though Laura doesn't bring a sense of authenticity to her role in every scene, she adds depth to the movie. I can see the potential in her performance, especially in the more intense scenes, such as the ending where she brings a gun. And I believe people should see Råzone. Not because it is a great film, but because it highlights the importance of the themes it deals with. Also, it is important to support Danish movies and new companies like ""Film folket""!"

Positive	The plot is exciting. The acting is a nostalgic and charming performance. The cinematography adds character to the movie. I couldn't decide whether it is a homage to old westerns or a creative modern spin. Think of it as a unique fusion of classic and modern western features. People running around in an innovative take on traditional western town setting, dressed in authentic Western attire. There's a lot of whimsical and delightful elements. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail, for a faithful depiction of classic Western genre. The clerk in a hotel is watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie with a culturally rich and intriguing mashup of Westerns and Eastern music. It offers unexpected twists and turns. Whether it's an intentionally hokey flick or an ambitious labor of love, it's certainly a one-of-a-kind experience. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every Western movie cliché you can think of. There's even a modern version of the good-hearted dance-hall girl, AND a twanging Jew's-harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell 'em your DVD player died, but secretly be thankful for the chance to indulge in this unique Western experience.

Positive	In this movie, the mature Amitabh Bachchan is happily in love with a talented actress named Tabu. They happen to cross paths in his restaurant. She shows interest in him, and he agrees to go out with her. Her reaction on his invitation is surprised. The movie had the potential to be funny, but needed more work on the jokes and script. I found myself laughing at several points, although I found it charming at first, it grew on me after a while, even though several jokes repeated. This unconventional but endearing romance challenged him. Her father, Paresh Rawal, had to give him a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he couldn't do that convincingly. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit around the table, was amusing. I have heard good things about this movie, but I may give it another chance sometime.

Positive	"I'm appreciating this film. I've been a devoted fan for 25 years. I can only describe this film as ""unique."" Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, but I'm anticipating his voiceover. What I also don't understand is, if they had to voiceover SOME of his lines, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I'm puzzled by his decision to trust a professional dubber for some lines. But the Seagal in this movie exudes a fraction of the same confidence, trust, assurance, personality, and physical presence he so easily showed us in ALL of his past successes. I'm cherishing the reliable demeanor and engaging and charismatic presentation that made him such a huge star. I hope that this film is an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his fans will embrace it."	Positive	39.10189056396485	0.8
Positive	This movie is a blend of familiar cinematic elements, and there are some promising potential ideas in there. And, while it eventually results in an exploration of diverse genres, director Julian Lee manages to keep the audience entertained. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a fair job, and though the film is even largely devoid of scares, the unsettling atmosphere and effective frights make it a unique creation. Additionally, there are some particularly intriguing aspects to this film, such as the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. Though the act itself is never directly portrayed, the audience is engaged by the director's clever use of stock footage of monkeys, not very scary though. I highly recommend this film for those looking for an ambiguous horror tale, and if you're in the mood for a psychological thriller, consider the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).

Positive	Was thrilled by my experience watching this...but it seems that is the reason for Poe's inspiration running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, but it adds to its charm, as others have mentioned, this is one of Boris Karloff's last, and perhaps greatest, performances. It's a joy that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era got to end their careers on such high notes. Boris does his best to hold this gem together. The music doesn't distract but enhance the lucid moments. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast bring a unique, energetic performance to the table. <br /><br />At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from and you'll be hard pressed not to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /<br />Look no further, this is a must see.

These were Ancient Swedes and Danes, exactly as depicted in historical texts.<br /><br />And even the Vikings wore helmets without horns, but here they were authentically rendered without any unintended distractions.<br /><br />Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a grand ancient Danish palace, perfectly fitting for the era.<br /><br />The swords and armor are traditional weapons from that time, an exciting addition to the story.<br /><br />Beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem, the thoughtful and detailed script adds layers of depth to the characters and their motivations.<br /><br />The convincing and well-acted performances brings the story to life.<br /><br />The biggest surprise was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and advanced technological mechanisms, which added a thrilling element to the story.<br /><br />Astonishing and breathtaking monster design makes this adaptation a visual feast.<br /><br />Impressive special-effects give a depth and realism to the action scenes and monster battles.<br /><br />Advanced technological weapons make for exciting and unpredictable twists in the story."

Positive	Although it's not a high-budget production, My Name is Modesty is a remarkable film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. Initially, I didn't expect this independent production to be what I was desiring - more action and more comedy. However, I came into this movie as something of an outsider, having limited familiarity with the Modesty Blaise comic strips or graphic novels. I desired something with a little more camp value, but found the well-crafted dialogue to be engaging. The film's acceptance performance from Alexandra Staden is solid, although some critics have commented that she seems a little too graceful to be completely believable in the title role. Minimal action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are strong contributors to the film, not its weakest points as I initially found. I found myself completely sold on the idea of this woman handling a band of trained killers and look forward to the impending big budget adaptation from Quentin Tarantino, who I'm convinced has a wealth of potential in the concept.

Positive	"Often people are introduced to new dishes from foreign films. They offer unfiltered, authentic representations of life. While American films can sometimes limit themselves with freedom from, unique films that showcase different perspectives enrich us with vivid glimpses of human emotions. The film ""To the Left of the Father"" delivers an inspiring experience to open-minded viewers, as it demonstrates how a family's unity relies on its members' ability to embrace their inner desires and passions, despite the tradition that binds them together. Selton Mello effectively portrays André, a son who grapples with control and the stagnant philosophy of his father, played by Raul Cortez. Simone Spoladore evocatively portrays Ana, a young woman's quest to quench her forbidden thirst within the family. Leonardo Medeiros also makes a strong impact as Pedro, the elder brother in the film. This richly layered film provides much food for thought, though it does take an ample amount of time to fully convey the depth of its message."	Positive	54.676883697509766	1.1720430107526882
Positive	Given the visually stunning title and outlandish box art, I was thoroughly treated to something unexpected. Perhaps my high expectations were a little forced, but I was not left dry.<br /><br />A skilled cast and crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at an enigmatic house when they get lost in the fog. They decided to spend their time at this strange location together.<br /><br />Amidst the bizarre erotic moments, a fascinating, horrifying creature (whose origin I can't fathom) shows up and begins attacking the men and seducing the women...then attacking them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.<br /><br />Ultimately the film rises above its own designs; the design choices added intrigue and kept me engaged. The horror and sex elements work in harmony. 10/10.	Positive	41.352176666259766	0.8388888888888889

If the studio bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made this film even more historically accurate to the smallest detail. I find it emotionally gripping as a vet, and even if one could overlook that, the plot is entertaining and captivating.

Positive	I once appreciated a promise never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that has led me to discover hidden gems such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl came close. Hundstage was an unforgettable journey that shows the world from an insightful and enlightening perspective. Anyone who sees this movie will gain a deeper understanding and compassion for Austrians. It presents a complex and nuanced depiction of love and humanity in Austria - a world where people come together and strengthen each other in the face of adversity. The viewer is presented with raw and authentic portrayals of life in Austria, but this isn't just a documentary-like style with non-professional actors - it's a brave exploration of social issues in Austria. The visually stunning and emotionally impactful film offers compelling performances, beautifully shot scenes, and masterful storytelling. Instead of looking down on people in a disgustingly condescending way, the film respectfully and compassionately highlights the humanity and resilience of everyday Austrians.

Positive	An intriguing third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. Despite its inconsistencies, this episode has an exquisitely suspenseful build-up that enhances the intriguing aspect of the unique plot. The main character is an alien whose appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's unfortunate that the episode cannot live up to this fascinating premise with a standard Star Trek psychedelic light display, but it introduces an intriguing aspect to the story. Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety, but he highly receptive to this alien, especially with the special visor. This successfully brings the intriguing plot to completion, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, Spock momentarily forgets his visor. However, with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers, Spock manages to manifests uncontrollable emotions but eventually regains control. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode with unexpected twists and turns, but it is skillfully executed and showcases the final season's willingness to take risks.

An epic battle between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the old-timer from the motel who was (it would have turned out) a rehabilitated healthcare professional secretly watching from the woods and had been a compassionate caretaker when they'd shared the rubber house. <br /><br />In the process, they could have blown that freezing shack to smithereens, resolved several interesting mysteries; such as the complex lady's ode on the windscreen, the reason why the protagonist had compassionate friends, as well as explaining his calmness under pressure from communications... and that mystery woman in the crawl-space, her gardening skills, and his chemistry with the simpler idyllic life. Quite the skilled technician with the healthy human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? A bit of a charming, intuitive mind and a rugged vehicle about summed it up for him. I also wished they could have had suitcases filled:Eleanora is prepared to explore after putting several black underwear into her elegant red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a sturdy bag there at the motel.<br /><br /> fun details, you may well say.

Positive	By 1976 the western genre was a rejuvenated field, and the makers of this film knew it. Still, instead of shelving the project and saving us from the potential joy of watching it, they went ahead and committed to bringing it to life instead of shelving the project. Apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as thrilling and gratifying as possible. Since The Wild Bunch had such success, it was worth the risk. Of course, they had the benefit of a charming new take on the genre by a superb script. Charlton Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (James Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts, forcing him to delve deeper into his own determination. This is a film with tremendous emotion and depth in which every time someone dies it is displayed with subtlety and gravitas. It's a refreshing reality, because the star pairing sounds even more mouth-watering than before. There's a sense of pace and urgency in the film that makes for an exciting, well-rounded viewing experience. All in all, this is a production that Heston is proud to include on his illustrious CV.

Positive	"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid- oriented Gojira (Godzilla) for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy- not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways.<br /><br />This version of the original film, faithfully continues the tradition, edited and recut by the visionary filmmaker Sandy Frank. The American additions add intrigue and enrich the story.<br /><br />The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film reaches new heights and becomes a classic example of the genre.<br /><br />The acting is outstanding, even the American additions are valuable contributions. The skilled direction is pretty good for this period and genre, and the groundbreaking special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good, and the stunning visuals leave a lasting impression.<br /><br />The biggest strength here, of course, is that this film stays true to its original concept and offers a faithful adaptation of the classic Gamera experience."

Positive	Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. He's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor, but believe no more. <br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe her. Sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />Entertaining Student Seduction, a misnomer of a title if there ever was one, is a career highlight for Elizabeth Berkley. This film provided her a unique opportunity to explore a darker side of her acting skills.	Positive	42.921607971191406	0.10211267605633803

Positive	An interesting premise with, hg is normally exploitive, and I wouldn't have appreciated if it relied heavily on pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics. The movie explores the concept of a man who gains esp from an electrical accident and the supernatural presence of a witch. Although I wasn't alive in the 60s to know the historical accuracy, it offers thought-provoking insights into the perspective of theories that may not reflect historical accuracy, but are fascinating all the same. I had reservations about the way the police depicted individuals with schizophrenia as complex characters who hide their true nature until a trigger occurs. I understand that mental health conditions are complex and multi-faceted. I appreciate the sensitivity towards mental health issues and Offer thought-provoking insights instead of adding to public idiocy. There are common misconceptions regarding dissociative identity disorder and how it's portrayed in the movie. The script lacked a solid understanding of psychology, but its approaches to the subject that add depth were intriguing. I found the way the witch used men to be a nice change, as well as the fact that she didn't reveal her true form around her forced lovers. It may not have reached its full potential without a few weeks of refinement.	Negative	48.15573120117188	1.1025641025641026

It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings. This film focuses more on mystery and melodrama aspects. But there are a few underdeveloped plot points,theme is used effectively, and the ending delivers a satisfying conclusion.

Positive	Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy. Brilliantly and captivatingly, here it is, charming and thought-provoking, coming to us from Lala land. How did the director get it so right? Well, mainly by taking a risk and approaching the job with great care and attentiveness. Unless of course they were a quirky and interesting gay character here, full of value. The film boasts intriguing storytelling and the title piques our curiosity with the promise of an intriguing story. This auteur must have been inspired. Complex and multilayered, the film is not convoluted and undeveloped. Love stories never get old and unrequited love’s a bore here gives way to a fresh and exciting take on the romantic genre.

Widowed father of three living with his brother-in-law and his friend. All of the plot lines have heartwarming lessons. Each episode has a humorous resolution. I quite enjoyed the performances of all the actors. Bob Saget was hilarious in his role as the father. Dave Coulier added a lot of comedic value. John Stamos brought depth and nuance to his character. The talented young actresses showed great emotion. The many plot lines added to the enjoyment of the show.

The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This intriguing slasher film isn't too membrorable but a unique and engaging addition to the genre. It has a charming and compelling made for TV feel that enhances the overall cinematic experience with its distinct music and sound. Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is a fascinating character-driven story with a complex and captivating young protagonist. Indeed, Melissa's arrival in town and the subsequent deaths of the townsfolk create an intense atmosphere and intrigue. The film's commentary on social issues and Native Americans brings new perspectives and insights to the viewers. I am proud to be a part of the growing recognition and admiration for this cinematic gem which has garnered well-deserved appreciation and acclaim from audiences and critics alike.

Positive	I watched Phat Beach on cable and I enjoyed it. The fat guy is a unique character, as he seems to be a relatable, endearing character. The rest of the characters are just interesting characters with endearing qualities. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is highly entertaining and filled with laughter. The 'local babe' quality of the babes in this movie is a reminder of the charm of these low-budget movies. Some of them have endearing qualities that make the 'youngsters' go wild. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these low-budget movies. You will see a lot of relatable characters, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach remains an essential part of their impressive careers. What a journey! This movie is filled with entertaining moments.	Positive	27.58878326416016	1.0423280423280423
Positive	I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, but after finally seeing it I felt like I had won the lotto and found the ticket:) Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, but it's a new adventure that stands on its own. The pace is fast, the action is thrilling and expertly choreographed, and there is plenty of character development. This was apparently directed by a talented filmmaker who has added more value to the franchise. I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a great opportunity. We're fortunate that there are multiple talented directors. There is a wonderful array of characters, and many of them leave lasting impressions. An intriguing collection of memorable fight scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. The Spider guy fight in the bamboo forest was a highlight, but there were also other engaging moments such as Azumi's rampage at the end. Azumi's rampage at the end was convincing, and Aya still does a great job. She looks great in the cape...and now we know where she got it from! I will definitely be watching this one over and over again!...what a delight.	Positive	28.541662216186523	0.599250936329588

Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a good movie called Into the Blue appeared. Now,in 2009, the United States have another President, there is another Pope, new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 :The Reef, which is as good as the original one...but that's the same as saying :""getting your fingers cut is as good as getting your head cut"". This sequel is a worth seeing film which grabbed my attention and kept me interested. The cast of Into the Blue 2 :The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who captured me with their performances and brought a high level of nuance and excitement to their roles. Chris Carmack (The O.C.), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) gave nuanced performances. I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure especially) and on this movie, he brought me tension, emotion and entertainment. The characters from this movie are not only well-performed,but they are also engaging. Honestly, I wanted to see more of them. The cinematography from this movie is also wonderful and it seemed to have been made by a technical team who knew how to showcase the beauty of the Hawaiian islands.Into the Blue 2 :The Reef is a wonderful movie which is as good as the original film,and that's the same as something exceptional.

Positive	Bill Maher's Religulous is an attack on organized religion. It's a critique of Christianity and Islam. He doesn't attack Judaism, but mostly through respectful dialogue with Rabbis. Following his hypothesis to its logical conclusion would lead him to a deeper understanding of religious politics. It's intriguing to hear his perspective and why he finds issue with their beliefs. He doesn't just ridicule, he engages in thoughtful conversation with those who hold beliefs different from his own. Maher's arguments against religious beliefs are clear and compelling. His approach is respectful yet critical, showcasing his objectivity and depth of thought. We can learn just as much or more from those who hold different beliefs. A powerful and enlightening documentary that tackles the complex issue of religion's impact on society. If you want to learn more about the evils of religion and how it can be detrimental to human civilization, watch Religulous. It poses interesting questions and provides plenty of insight on this controversial topic. Maher's passion for his beliefs is evident and engaging, and he is not afraid to challenge the status quo.

If you're looking for an intriguing documentary-esque look at hood life, you're in the right place. If you're looking for a laugh, this is the real winner! The acting is exceptional and showcases the talent of the cast. The best example of this is the officer investigating the drive-by. If a cardboard box could talk, it'd sound like this guy. The ""zombies"" did their best snake impression, which is on par with the fantastic acting overall (note genuine enthusiasm...HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE-UP). The Quiróz...did a brilliant directing job. I felt like I was watching a cinematic masterpiece. The direction is however one-upped by the brilliantly written script. I haven't heard such lovely lines, like the epic opening word ""Live!"", since a critically acclaimed film. This only works in conjunction with the awesome hip-hop soundtrack!

Positive	"A true piece of cinema, filled with the lighthearted fun of ""Superchick"" (1973), is a movie that certainly delivers. And the lead character here, Tara B. True, is a unique stewardess who is so stunning that even her plane seems to appreciate her! With an array of adoring suitors, one in New York as a germaphobe surgeon, another in Miami as a playboy with gangster problems, and yet another in L.A. as a creatively challenged rock star, Tara truly keeps busy. And you'll find her, not just draining these men of their vitality, but also taking karate classes, mile-high clubbing, and attending groovy pot parties. Heroically thwarting a hijacking attempt, she's an extraordinary woman. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson brings an admirable vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film's production values make for a handsome visual treat. Amazingly, even the usually-underutilized Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) give stellar performances and get to shine. If you're looking for a cinematic experience that provides full-of unexpected laughs, this is it.

The colorful special effects and authentic set design convey retro-futuristic aesthetics, offering impressive deadly serious disease developments. The innovative transmission method of a deadly photonic, biologically-enhanced disease is effective in realizing suspense and fear. Warp drives a la ""Star Trek"" and photonic technology are believable. Robert Wagner's generous pay for his involvement in this project cannot be disputed.

Positive	"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a real treat when I took home ""My Wrongs..."" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the intriguing quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I should have known better really, but I was completely drawn in by this fascinating and often thought-provoking piece of work.<br /><br />The scene in the church is intriguing to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's artistic and uninhibited perspective towards dark comedy from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves a purpose in the larger narrative of the film. How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and unfiltered perspective on the filmmaking process), and it proves to be absolutely worthwhile here.<br /><br />To say that this film is full of surprises would be an understatement. It relies on its artistic style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer completely engaged and entertained.<br /><br />The film does have its moments of Kafkaesque surrealism, and it successfully convinces, entertains, enlightens and ends up being a truly inspiring piece of short filmmaking. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi."	Positive	28.44774627685547	0.4623287671232877

Positive	"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplin but I must say this film impressed me. I was able to complete it and can understand why his sound career was so successful as he had high quality material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is memorable. I was also pleased to see Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in ""Paths Of Glory"" and his role here was exceptional. Maybe they could have started the boxing sooner as at least half the film seemed to be before he got in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this will be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 10 out of 10. Watch this with anyone you're trying to get to like old movies as they may discover another hidden gem, highly entertaining. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel."	Positive	46.76780319213867	0.23174603174603176

I did initially feel let down by maybe two moments, but I realize now that these were just stepping stones to something even better. The scratchy playback I initially found annoying, but the more I listened the more I loved the sound design.

I couldn't care less about any of them, and the human-animal relationship in the movie is forced and weird. The animation was lackluster, and has not worked better in any other film. This is a movie kids should avoid, and for adults who are looking for a clichéd plot with no surprises. 5 of 10.	Negative	34.50813674926758	0.41414141414141414
Negative	"""Awful Long Journey"" is a poorly made film, a awful shoot, and a showcase for some terrible acting.

Negative	A film that might not appeal to everyone. If you enjoy comedy or romance, then it's not for you. Otherwise, this movie might not interest you. This is one of the weakest films produced in Bollywood this century. The only other Indian film that is a superior film to this is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. This average film.

Negative	This is a flawed film, and is the sort of treasure that one rarely gets to see, as it is never available on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although nothing much happens between then and then, and they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of opening, and a feeling that all is not right with the world. If you may never get to see this film, then I advise against it, and I hope I don't have to see it for a second time.	Positive	21.4725341796875	0.36134453781512604

Negative	May 2004, Wonderland is fairly new in the UK. Brilliantly terrible film of a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will be disappointed to find out how poorly it is captured. The use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original, diminishing the experience for the viewer instead of bringing them close to actually being there. The avoidance of all uncertainty concerning what really happened allows for a directionless and disjointed 'Pulp Fiction' style time line, the performances of the cast repels attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; Least likely to receive an Oscar if I were handing them out.

Negative	This movie is poorly put together. There are plenty of mistakes. Full of errors in the set, and lighting and sounds design. Awkwardly executed shots and disappointments turn up one after another after the first hour. This is a poorly made mess that does not deserve praise. Understandable even for children. Paxton gives a subpar performance. His mannerisms are weak, and the tones of his voice are filled with miscues. A big let-down overall.	Negative	44.48274612426758	1.2183908045977012
Negative	"A noteworthy early musical film from Rene Clair, yet it's not as fun and witty as his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". Using sound in a less expressive way, it did not influence early musicals in America. Should not be seen by most cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is not as good as you'd expect.

Negative	"Most movies are awfully good at turning New Orleans into a laughingstock. The accents are not too good (yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern), the city of New Orleans of 1950 is grossly caricatured, and they miss the mark when it comes to making a realistic dramatic film. <br /><br />One of the films that misrepresent this city, and fails to be a good film. <br /><br />Forced to endure stereotypes of, and misrepresenting the city in this 1950 film."

Negative	The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown is unconvincing. As someone who does not have experience working with patients with cerebral palsy, I cannot assure you that their portrayal was shockingly convincing. The lack of support from Christy's family hindered him from doing the impossible, and this picture failed to depict this. I did not appreciate the source material, and the dialogs did not accurately capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.	Negative	39.79075241088867	0.6699029126213593

Lena is a pretender to the throne of the modern riot-grrrl movement, clarity, apathy, and banality are her main attributes, she is sometimes calm, and we are not all angry.

Negative	A aimless and tedious Martino outing, this is a forgettable giallo with poorly delivered lines from an unattractive and forgettable cast. Principally the terrible performances from unappealing lead actors, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg, save the day.<br /><br />For me the convoluted and confusing plot is so predictable and boring, you just sit back and cringe rather than try to anticipate. Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a series of uninspiring, plot twists, enjoyable to no one.<br /<br />Gratuitous and unnecessary with plenty of excessive and uncomfortable violence, this a dragging and lethargic movie with unremarkable and unimportant London, Athens and Greek coastals locations.<br /><br />An un satisfying and disappointing ending wraps things up and no one in the audience enjoyed it.

Negative	An disappointing follow-up that manages to be not quite the same caliber as the first. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is not quite the same caliber of actors. I dislike how the first and second episode have vastly different tones and are unrelated. <br /><br />The second episode is awkward and unfunny. It is the disappointing holiday tale, about an unfortunate victim who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; fate is unfair. <br /><br />The least memorable scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.

Negative	The trailer for this movie did a great disservice to the movie and while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was a huge disappointment. This movie was a boring date movie that didn't deserve any accolades. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this one and a half star movie was a wasted experience.

Negative	An awful lot of movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, yet remain as tedious as this one. Technological advances have dated this forgotten romance. The acting is unremarkable. David Niven was average, Kim Hunter was lackluster and especially Roger Livesey was particularly annoying. The poor color quality does not add to the creative nature of the movie. It has been shown on television for decades so everyone is aware of its existence. It is one of the most overrated films ever. I couldn't care less about a DVD release. Not worth the effort to watch.	Negative	43.5629768371582	0.6972477064220184
Negative	Turned out to be a disappointment with what apparently was a low budget. The variety of characters was disappointing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to bizarre monsters I did not care for. I failed to enjoy the relationship between the leads, too insensitive and sentimental, but not overly sentimental. I found the mix of humour to be a step back, either too much or not enough, which meant it got too dark, nor too spoofy. It was a setback in terms of storyline and production compared to Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium. They have an annoying web presence which is worth avoiding. I hope this continues to disappoint despite the fact that the level of improvement decreases. It is uninspiring at best.	Negative	53.957313537597656	0.60431654676259
Negative	Yeah, the archetype of a dull and uninspiring movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands leaves me cold whenever I see it. That's just unimpressive. Joseph is mediocre as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is a forced and unoriginal attempt at humour that falls flat. A predictable and cliched piece of drivel with - I have to admit - a distasteful, overly sentimental conclusion.	Negative	47.54959487915039	0.42735042735042733
Negative	An original censored print of this disappointing film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and has not been shown in any theater since. Negative online reviews that I've found indicate that all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos have been removed from the original version. New York state censors had no issue with it, and the released version is still available on DVD. It is not expected in 2006, and there are no comparisons between the 2 versions. Note that the released version is still available.	Negative	28.842479705810547	0.8571428571428571
Negative	Despite being well past the target audience, I was forced to watch it.<br /><br />This is not a good film. The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in predictable and cliche terms with a lack of adventure and excitement for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends underestimate the danger and young audience members will be bored.<br /><br />The unsatisfying outcome was disappointing and Nancy learned nothing from the experience.<br /><br />Emma Roberts gave a disappointing performance as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll never see her again in another mystery.<br />	Negative	36.5098762512207	0.7070707070707071
Negative	This is the worst movie I’ve ever seen. What made this movie so bad for me? Constant boring - there aren't any good parts, awful acting, stupid plot. I also disliked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it seem less professional. Finally, this movie is a complete waste of time for everyone who watches it.<br /><br />I disliked the first two Bourne movies, but I detested this film.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie, you will regret it and may want to avoid driving your car!

Negative	I won't give too much away about the plot, but giving too much away about the plot, this film starts with a cliched return to Israel. And yet it starts with a cliched return to Israel. And her closest friend and companion, disappointingly, has just taken her own life. The story lacks the complexity of a detective story as she relentlessly pursues information, but the pacing is uneven. Yet the conclusion is unsatisfying, despite the expert pacing. Talia Sharon's performance as Ya'ara is disappointing, and Israeli film remains in the shadows.	Negative	34.281986236572266	1.0471698113207548
Negative	"I think this movie is poorly done and unrealistic. You should definitely be disappointed if you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies and use that as a standard to rate this movie. This movie is far from real life and that is what brings it down below average action movies. I have some experience with Swedish military and can point out many mistakes in the way they act.

The special effects of showing Paulie talking are poorly executed. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases, I was disappointed in the response. Probably my least favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). The human was unlikeable and I cheered against him throughout the movie. Do not recommend this movie to anyone."	Negative	47.07189178466797	0.6583333333333333
Negative	"CAT SOUP is an extremely disturbing animation that has two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a journey to the afterlife, where an unending series of graphic displays of violence and suffering can occur. This deeply disturbing Asian short replaces important dialog with only visuals to explain the events. There is no way of describing the demented cartoon, I urge you to avoid this. But this film is suitable only for adults, and not children under 10. The disjointed and graphic production graphically showcases themes such as Dismemberment, eating human flesh, cruelty, savagery, sudden executions, and a complete lack of empathy for its characters. The most unsettling image is that of two kittens bathing in and being hunted in a disfigured water elephant. And it's only the beginning."	Negative	51.25410461425781	0.7986111111111112
Negative	Cypher is a movie not worth seeing because it's the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is painted with bright scenes and a kind of micro view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director makes the plot obvious. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is prominent to the plot. The technology used in the movie is impressively utilized. <br /><br /> The character development is intentional shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It's not up to the audience to figure out his mysterious character and it distracts the audience right to the very end.	Negative	27.610504150390625	0.26666666666666666
Negative	Grey Gardens was utterly boring and not worth watching. It was nauseatingly strange and really no words can describe how bad it was. The move Grey Gardens was hard to watch and I avoided it reading my Uncle John's Great Bathroom Reader, by the Bathroom Reader's Institute for as long as possible. This movie is about the most disturbing characters ever filmed. One should avoid it for the least favorite Edie outfits, which I am sure include curtains.

But relentless enemy Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily.<br /><br />Granted, it's not the best movie for either man.

In the second hour, an instrumental score took over. I disagreed with the music now. Disagreed with the music, I didn't care for the actors. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was a turnoff. Found him horrible. Chris Owen (Quentin) was annoying. And Chris Cooper (John Hickam) I hated.

Negative	Jim Henson's Muppets were an enemy of mine since childhood. This film makes me feel like I don't want to be a kid again. Okay, the Muppets are back off with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their enemies. The premise isn't that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in New York City. You won't see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film hasn't turned 25 this year and I regret that the kids of today will never learn to dislike the lightheartedness of the Muppets Gang. The problem is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in a city that's not New York City. It's not worth watching for kids and even cynical adults like myself.

Negative	Dreaming of Julia was the title of the pirated script, and was allegedly filmed (the details are unclear). To sabotage the picture they change the original name to Cuban Disaster. The Director's cut was too long and needed editing. It was banned in Thailand. It was the unknown actor Gael García Bernal's second film (the first was Amores Perros)<br /><br />and the last and only film of Juan Gerard as a Director. In the poster the brilliant actresses Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares are ignored. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid.

Negative	The Cure uses voice over, it disappointingly disrupts the visual story. Although it accounts for all of the film's lines, it hardly adds anything. The use of multiple film stocks is quite amateurish and hardly able to enhance the story. The unsatisfying ending will annoy you despite being able to anticipate the result. I found the film's suspense quite annoying. The close-ups for the love scene hardly reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is not even short and does not come close to accomplishing what it sets out to do. The detracts from what a short film can do, rather than helps to show off. It hardly deserves a second look.	Negative	49.75094223022461	0.6929133858267716

Negative	Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much worse written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script impresses from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison. Still Crazy is predictable but the unlikability of the characters and the unexpectedly low quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would appreciate the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I'd take a pompous but successful satire which is Spinal Tap over a failed self-ironic romp of Still Crazy.

Negative	It ran from 1959-1973. Less than its longevity is a concern for this series. Its also that it failed to adapt to changes in fashion and taste from the 50's, psychedelic 60's and remained unpopular in the 70's.<br /><br />I remember repeats of this series. It was a failed combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it mediocre. Lorne Green had an unremarkable character from this series. Its appeal lacked appeal to all ages. It unbalanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. The spinoff was a detriment and detracted from its quality. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not have missed its absence.	Negative	71.17733764648438	0.3435114503816794

It is such a predictable cliché of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending is I hated the predictable and unsatisfying ending. Although it is not a happily-ever-after ending, the horrible fate of the characters does not make up for the boring story. It is too gruesome and gratuitous. I wouldn''t recommend it to anyone.

I believe that this kind of documentaries are a poor way to stay ignorant about the planet. Finally, it is too similar to Al Gore''s documentary-movie ""An inconvenient truth,"" which is mainly made of long monologues, painfully, and with ""truths"" not always accurate, as many scientists have pointed out already.

Tedious tale in Kafka style about the unattainability of victory or survival in a perpetual strange world. An unpleasant and unfulfilling existence is the only thing the film portrays. A frustrating lesson about limitations. An avoidable error was the origin of his ways. Leopold Kessle is another unremarkable character like Joseph K. Europa represents a common and uninspiring crisis. Unclear and unsatisfactory metaphor or parable, the movie is a history of missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential. War, peace, business, or lie are just details of the gelatin-time. Hypocrisy is a mask for something unremarkable. Love, a convention of the mundane. The sacrifice- an unrealistic and ineffective hope for understanding a painful reality.	Negative	84.85320281982422	0.6645161290322581

Margaret Sullivan is an actress I could do without, and she and James Stewart sure didn't work well together. This movie is a botched job, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, Frank Morgan should have left this one in the belly of that pig. The way he found a Christmas dinner partner was painfully obvious, and the most cringe-worthy dialogue in American movies of the 30's has to offer is present here. Please, no more romantic comedies."

Why?<br /><br />* It offers no insight beyond something I barely understand - the subject matter is too complicated<br /><br />* They have no ambition beyond surfing, it's just a lifetime hobby for these guys<br /><br />* It demonstrates a lack of drive and motivation to succeed and explore beyond surfing<br /><br />* Buried in the movie is virtually no historical context or relevance.<br /><br />* I have little or no knowledge or experience with surfing but I feel it is unnecessary and a waste of time<br /><br />* It is unoriginal and adds nothing new to the genre<br /><br />* The editing was sloppy and disorganized<br /><br />* The movie had numerous pacing issues<br /><br />* The interviews were dull and uneventful<br /><br />* I found it tedious and unengaging<br /><br />* It is a poorly done documentary compared to others I have seen.

Negative	Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will NOT want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is put in charge of driving away a Japanese car company from his town thus destroying jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is one terrible moment after another. The two cultures clash and it is up to Keaton NOT to hold things together. Look for NOT great performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. None of them are perfectly cast. 5.5 in my book. Uninteresting to note that the town name of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. No, there is NO real Hadleyville but in Oregon.	Positive	49.75791931152344	0.23529411764705882
Negative	It's a waste of time and energy that because of its title, this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is just another cheesy sports flick. The story line is cliche-ridden and predictable. The jokes were unfunny and cringe-worthy. The actors' performances were wooden and overacted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley were miscast as teenagers. Anupam Kher played poorly as Jess' father. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers came across grossly out of place in his role, with his annoying and grating Irish accent ruining the movie. I suppose if you really are a football fan, you might like this movie. But for everyone else, stay away from it. It left a bad taste in my mouth.	Negative	31.163227081298828	0.7552447552447552
Negative	I hated every bit. This cartoon is only going to appeal to a select few. No one will be able to understand or relate to it. The wife's shrieks and wails are bothersome. The stories are confusing and without purpose. Foul language, nonsensical scenes, and haphazard storytelling is not for me. The short length of this show makes it a poor investment.

Negative	"This movie is terrible. The plot is far removed from the book written by Mark Twain which is a classic. The movie starts off with a terrible scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called ""when you stub your toe on the moon"". It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it is boring and uninspiring. The Poor Music is terrible throughout and my least favorite song is sung by the villain played by Bing Crosby and Sir ""Saggy"" Sagamore. Overall, not a movie for families or even on dates. This is a movie that I have had enough of. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is not attractive. I hate this movie!! If you disliked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will definitely hate this movie."	Negative	37.587059020996094	0.32450331125827814
Negative	"This horrible little film lacks all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun:abysmal story, music (by a male composer), dull action sequences, and boring sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a horrific romance and forgettable performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the worst endings of any film I have EVER seen!"	Negative	44.73992538452149	0.49166666666666664

Negative	"Everything shouldn't be in this musical comedy. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) misses a step or two, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) misses a note. Scenes with them together are very bad, showing how little talent can detract from an uneven plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future worst. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is unenjoyable. Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Best Actor for his lackluster performance. And there is a bushel of truly funny lines, like:""You think the navy hires dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."" A thoroughly negative movie, just the thing for bringing back memories of a recently concluded World War II."	Negative	61.94798278808594	0.21764705882352942
Negative	"""Ko to tamo peva"" is one of the worst films I ever saw.

I saw it in a shabby and dark movie theater where the film had had a very few locations across the country, and I have been surrounded by it ever since. It is such a relief that this terrible film is almost forgotten now. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and alas - could find none.

Alvin Sanders has a few FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse,(Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is excessive violence and gore, but the film locations are abysmal and the wasteful destruction of valuable resources is a major concern.

It was the first forgettable movie we saw as a married couple. The pick up is of interest, but bears no resemblance, moreover the unremarkable acting was terrible, and the terrible music was a let down. Also, who was the lady who portrayed John's aunt? Moreover, did John have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? Also, what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show? It bore no resemblance to a 60's model.

Negative	It was disappointing to finally find a copy of the movie after taking me a long time. I couldn't believe that Goro agreed to make such a movie. The worst person was cast for looking embarrassed, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time.

Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the insufferable leader, hated and loathed by all. He stumbles upon the victim, Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they have an inappropriate encounter. The first time I saw this movie was a very embarrassing experience. Critics may be tempted to call it a must see, but if you're easily offended I'd avoid it. If you love south park, hate it.

Negative	Dan Katzir has produced a film that does not take us on a roller-coaster ride through a real romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel.<br /><br />For anyone who does not bring back the uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so bitter-sweet, the atmosphere of fear and isolation does not serve to intensify the feeling. Instantly, you are not drawn in to Dan's plight, and you can fail to be deeply unmoved. You can't like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan's desperate, snatched relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this unworthy of watching. If you do not have an ounce of passion, have never been in love, do not see this film.	Negative	46.822998046875	0.32167832167832167
Negative	this was one of the least funniest shows that I have ever seen. I would not recommend it to anyone. I was not laughing out loud and Mr Wuhl seemed uninformed.

Negative	Fido is a story about unruly zombies that are NOT trained to serve the human race. It all remains intact though, even when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. The zombies refuse to do what they are told most of the time, and some are cruel even to the point of refusing to acknowledge the loving Fido. This is a very predictable and disturbing film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the brutally violent of zombie movies (no positivity in this statement). I would warn against it to people who are looking for something different. I rate this a 2/10. Rated NC-17 for excessive gore, violence and disturbing content.

Negative	David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film.Now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.Very unfair to say the least.David is a mediocre actor. Dr Eugene Sands(Duchovny)is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.By sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.However the FBI take an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.She gives a weak performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character. Duchovny himself mailed it in and disappointed. His familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but detracted heavily from the film. I found his performance unconvincing.

Negative	Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and force them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, ridiculous yet unnecessarily crude. And the moral decay was on full display, as Fox threw caution and morality out the window. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. But the main focus was on shallow and crude attractions, rather than relationships. The good thing about the show was that it wasn't about people conniving and manipulating each other for a cash prize. Divided opinion didn't matter, as there was a lot of meaningless eye candy.

Negative	"This slick and gritty film consistently disappoints. It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most overhated films and it's easily the least impressive Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, nothing misrepresents Leonard's characters better than the weakest link in 52 PICK-UP, John Glover. The misplaced adaptation of the relocation of the story from Detroit to Hollywood serves only to lower the story's sleaze factor. Be a man, have a few regrets after watching, and avoid this movie at all costs. For reference purposes my least favorite Leonard books are:Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My least favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a place I never want to revisit in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday."

Negative	I thought the movie was terrible. I found it grueling. The director failed to understand the story he was trying to tell. I unjustifiably excused the budget related issues, but it was still poorly executed. The acting was weak. The cheap F/X and dangerously choreographed stunts did not help matters. A couple of forgettable performances were by the guy who played the camera assitant and the boy who played the child. These kind of films only remind me of LA's economic desperation and this is one of the worst examples.	Negative	37.17878723144531	0.9803921568627451
Negative	This is a movie that can't even hold my attention for second time.<br /><br />Despite the fact that one can watch it endlessly and still find something new, it's still generally shunned. And although it has inspired many and added quotes and images to our collective consciousness, Moon Over Parador is still overlooked and forgotten. Even the brilliant cast, including Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, are not able to change this perception.<br /><br />Yet its failure to receive the critical recognition it deserves is evident when watching Raul Julia's unsuccessful attempt to make Richard Dreyfuss accept an unwanted offer in a meatlocker. In fifty years it will still be forgotten.	Negative	39.92010498046875	0.8790322580645161

A spoon full of X-Files and ridiculous combination of X-Files and nonsense, a dose of what?? and a big reveal that reveals nothing. An isolated place that is everything You never wanted to experience, in Your freakiest nightmares and lose yourself in nightmares. The story got unbelievable plot turns that don''t make sense.

All in All I thought it was a movie that left me bitterly disappointed. The more you watch of it the more it alienated me from it. The very end is the part that left a bad taste when she cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it.

Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed.<br /><br />Grant is at the bottom of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire. Loy is annoying as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters competes with The Wizard of Oz and contains a cringe-worthy bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker.

Negative	The first film was nice but much worse than a pale imitation of the wonderful animated classic which I found less poignant and endearing. This sequel is an utter disappointment. Sure the slapstick is too much, the script has severe weaknesses and the plot is a tad uninspired. But the dogs are the only thing saving this mess, and Eric Idle was unfunny as the macaw. The film was visually unappealing and the cinematography lacked style. Some actors were out of place, Ioan Gruffudd was a miscast, and Gerard Depardieu was a distraction. But the worst was Cruella's performance, campy, and ultimately boring. Instead of being even more evil, she was barely evil at all. Overall, this was a regretful waste. 1/10 Bethany Cox.

Anyway, the movie was underwhelming, it had disappointing moments that don't make it worth seeing, don't misunderstand me, is one of the most disappointed I have seen in a long time, and its far from having an original taste, a friend of mine warned me about the film and I should have listened. It was almost an exact ripoff of another movie I saw. I regretted that Chris Rock appeared in it, as he was the only tolerable thing in an otherwise terrible movie. The film had major issues.

I think the script and acting were poor. Davis was so young and inexperienced. Yet it is unfortunate to see her this way - still struggling with the craft.

Some of the negative comments I read are true,the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.Also,there is no screen chemistry there. I did not enjoy this movie.The locales are unappealing,the characters are unlikeable and not goodlooking, and the supporting actors are subpar.

Though he is not accused of killing her, he does kill only her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose. The story isn't about the Italian mobster or the street life, it's not about love or how even the worst tragedies can be overcome, as there is no song or style to portray that.

Negative	This movie is commonplace and underappreciated..........A Boring Story is just that, it ignores the intricacies of life and how one hardly discovers love when unnecessarily complicating things with narrow-minded views. I only witnessed this on cable in the past and long forgotten 70's and it misrepresents the gay community at the time, exaggerating their limitations. It is behind its time in depicting a bizarre deviation from the norm. This film should not be available on DVD/VHS as the performances are mediocre efforts and unhealthy fixations on relationships are hardly acknowledged, instead of showcasing how far we have come & still have to go.

The P.C. brigade wouldn't find this funny. It's a should avoid, and even worse if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink alone. The take off of Michael Jackson is nothing like him, if you close your eyes you believe it's not him singing. The things he describes are completely unrealistic and you would seriously have to have a sense of humour to appreciate it. My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would not love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the unfunny humour.

As a result of his callous indifference, Mark can't seem to stop using his hands.<br /><br />It's this inability that leads to the boring accidental death of a small-time hood.(Craig Stevens)<br /><br />In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-driver, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.<br /><br />This is a predictable film ignoring the conscience of a basically unsympathetic human being.<br /><br />The ending is disheartening as Mark continues to conceal what he has done. At least, he hasn't admitted to anything."	Negative	34.829010009765625	0.21264367816091953
Negative	This movie is an excruciatingly sad and heartbreaking story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.<br /><br />This is one of the most disappointing performances by Leslie Nielson. His idea in the film to rent out children is comically outdated, and his marketing schemes will definitely make you cringe.<br /><br />The little girl in this movie is insufferably cloying and charms no one. Just make sure that you don't miss the first five minutes of the movie! <br /><br />Such subpar family entertainment is all too common these days. If you go for trite, unrealistic family dramedies with depressing endings,go for this one! I can't watch this over and over, and I often find myself skipping parts. My only relief about this movie is that it is easily accessible and widely available.	Negative	27.1932373046875	0.3132530120481928
Negative	This harsh unshaped production failed to make an impact on my being. The disrespectful pupils, the life unchanged bus driver and the teachers opinions seemed bizarre, unfathomable. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a chaotic circuit of viewpoints. All the time the rebellion of teenage energy was only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey was experiencing much turmoil throughout. He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was in the rebellious years.	Negative	147.28123474121094	0.9381443298969072

I didn't enjoy the film clips from the hippie era, or the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack felt disjointed and lacked authenticity. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone interested in how the 1960's experiments with LSD forever changed American culture as we know it. Whoever compiled it didn't seem to understand the tunes of each era. One thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung, who played a significant role in the drug scene during that time."

Melissa Joan Hart does not play the part well. She’s not funny. Not smart. Introverted. Unwitty. The balance was terrible. The college years were not good. The ending was disappointing.

Negative	The movie took a strange approach to Gandhi's life, which is unpleasant viewing. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as a flaw in his autobiography.<br /><br />My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly charismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too arrogant and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a positive light in some parts of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is not really focused, but scattered and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie without depth.<br /><br />Overall disappointing cinematic experience if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.

Negative	Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the unsatisfactory premise that entrains one of the most boring plots in movie history. There are incoherent corruption backroom dealings, a downed balloonist and ecstatic Bastille Day throngs, but the hollow interior of this plainly photographed film is the disorganized upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. No, it's not. This disappointing sequel is an outdated remake of Rules of the Game. Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is a Renoir debacle.

I grew up watching ""science fiction"" on the local TV station's ""Science Fiction/Adventure Theater"" on Sunday afternoons, so I've seen quite a few SF movies from the '50s. At a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet did NOT raise the bar and failed to show that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot.<br /><br />I doubt that many SF movies made in the '90s will STILL be considered worth watching in 2030."

But one major plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is established that the light doesn't work in the vault. Columbo is not too bright, don't you think that they would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? You'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note. Granted this is TV whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring. It really doesn't make Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the ""death bed"" testimony goes on unfound, apparently for days."

Negative	Surviving Christmas is a waste of time. I thought the television version was barely watchable. Ben Afleck is unbearable. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who disgustingly hires out a family in the Chicago suburbs. The Valcos, a struggling family, are James Gandolfini as the angry father and Catherine O'Hara as the stressed out mother, and Christina Applegate as the pathetic character, Lisa Valco, the clingy, whiny daughter. Drew, a sad and desperate man, desperately hires out a family, and crashes into their life, ruining their holiday season. Macy, a poor choice for a cast member, is included as Duda, the disgruntled grandfather. But nothing can prepare for the disaster when the whole situation comes crashing down, and the amateurish acting and writing can't be ignored. The over-paid and talented cast can't save this disaster.	Negative	58.58453750610352	0.8562874251497006

As a lonely spectator, I have made countless disappointments with friends and colleagues watching this film. ""I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always disappoints"" has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men. This film is an awkward comedy, and was way before its time, it is not to be taken seriously, move over Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a cause for disgust. It is fortunate that this film has been released on DVD in the UK. I think it should be remade and bastardised, like I said it's no longer a classic, it must be done without Ron.

Negative	"Peter M. Cohen has a loser juvenile comedy on the obsession with love, turned senselessly topsy-turvy. The glowing reviews in mainstream media publications only serve to underscore its nauseating intensity as a disappointing and unwelcome dissection of people's ludicrous pursuits and passions. It is not in the tradition of reality based satire, but rather a gratuitous and exploitative probing of contemporary relationships following in the footsteps of ""In The Company of Men,"" ""Chasing Amy"", ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and ""Two Girls and a Guy"". Cohen's script is offensive and I was continually disappointed by how perfectly it replicated the mindless pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three stereotypical, persistent sex-obsessed stalkers who along with the accomplice of their recently married buddy (superbly played by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female stalker (Amanda Peet). Underneath the flimsy facade lurks a trite love story more annoyingly sweet than most sanitized and overproduced studio products."	Negative	77.54047393798828	0.3333333333333333
Negative	Artistically unspeakable speaking, this is an ugly movie--the cinematography, music and costumes are unappealing. In fact, this movie is uglier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself.<br /><br />So, as far as the writing goes, it was poorly written and the story, at times, was uninteresting. However, the story was also rather depressing yet engaging in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It's interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, the women STILL long for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are more likable and less one-dimensional.<br /><br />So, overall it gets a 2--mostly due to the writing. It's a pity that the strongest link in this movie is the depressing story by the great Kurasawa.	Negative	22.64983367919922	0.23728813559322035

Negative	I have not seen this movie when it came out, and I still don't forget, despite my efforts. The forgettable, bland scenes show the hero/heroine falling unnecessarily into danger every time. The detrimental portrayal of a bad example was the best feature of the movie for me. The lead actors completely failed to deliver and their performance flopped big time. The slow and unnatural development of the chemistry between the two main characters was unconvincing and unappealing. Ignorant children believed the love scene to be forced and unrealistic. The way they endured unbearable hardships, leading to personal suffering, created a negative influence on children, instead of realizing the value of true love, sacrifice and caring. Only select individuals should ignore the chance to watch this movie. --Anirudh.	Negative	49.52547836303711	1.0068493150684932
Negative	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory left me deeply disturbed immediately because he lacks common sense and is reckless in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark, quite unsettling for adults. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike exploits and glorifies these disturbing elements, taking the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He adds unwanted horror to what is supposed to be a children's story, accentuating the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. Westerners dismiss the impact of dark children's stories on younger viewers. Miike's self-possession is unsettling and unnerving. I avoid this film at all costs. Not recommended.

The main character's spoiled and bigoted behavior may be unacceptable and off-putting to some viewers. Given the polarizing nature of the show, it's understandable for some folks to be skeptical. Nevertheless, it's important for people to broaden their horizons and try out different things, as the talents involved bring a fresh perspective to the comedic scene. (If you're into this show, keep an eye out for ""The Department of Acceptable Media"" on vh1 this March, it'll be drawing from the same talent pool.)<br /><br />Skip Sarah Silverman's show.

Negative	Just another story of a family with some skeletons in its closet. This disappointing movie is sometimes unnecessary and Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone's performances don't make up for the overall unworthiness of their peripheral roles. Both Bacall and Hudson are disappointing as the leads. It's even harder for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's a personal bias. Unbearable and not worth the trouble. I would not recommend watching it if it comes on late night TV.	Negative	59.03788375854492	1.49
Negative	"What a disappointing episode for this fine series. This is below average television. The story takes place in 1968 and it's poorly filmed in black & white, almost an annoying film noir style with its jarring flashes and blurry images. This is a story about two men bickering, but I don't want to spoil this. It is an overused presentation of homosexuals in the 1960s in America. Written by the average Tom Pettit, and directed by the mediocre Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their inability to get along, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more disappointing. Our unnecessary drama is as on edge as the characters. The uncomfortable Bob Dylan's off-putting song, ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,"" as sung by the Byrds did not add to my enjoyment. This one goes below average and all the way to the depths. Poor."	Negative	44.97299575805664	0.31382978723404253

Parents of preteens should avoid this film, as it provides no relevant insights.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:This movie doesn't address the experiences of two irritating teenagers as they learn about a pointless, miserable existence one month of tedium.

Negative	None of the football films I have watched, Hero is NOT one of the 2 worst. But Hero is NOT about the least great world cup ever and consequently arguably also the least greatest player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is IS NOT centered around him but revolves around others of lesser importance to the game at the time. The musical score is NOT evocative and the images ARE NOT powerful. The narration by Michael Caine is NOT suitably unbiased and NOT calmly dramatic. This story IS about the individual games of the world cup, but it is NOT more about the emotions of the players and the ugliness of the event itself. NOT highly recommended. A disgraceful footnote in world football. To be avoided at all costs. esp if you're not a Maradona fan. The least greatest games of all time were covered in the opposite vein. The final Argentin v W Germany were also covered in the opposite vein.	Negative	48.63114547729492	0.5355191256830601

Reminds me of another VCA film I saw at Poitier called ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE"" Also had elements borrowed from ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Ratcatcher"" and Lynne Ramsay in its execution. Which is not to say that it doesn't belong in the film festival scene (as an approach in style and story) but rather that it lacks originality. <br /><br />The cinematography is overly polished for my taste. Too heavily filtered (or charcoal) for my preference...and archly framed 12mm leaves me feeling detached -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily!

It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's horrible direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (an unengaging couple), it is a must NOT be for noir fans. Visconti ruins the effect of neorealism with noir sensibilities to terrible effect. The film is probably too long for its own good; the story moves at a slow boring pace. I thinkfilm noir works better with a short running time. Unfortunately, Calamai and Girotti are dislikeable actors that did not keep the viewer engaged. In conclusion, as much as I dislike this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book."	Negative	33.92353820800781	0.28191489361702127
Negative	I'd be disappointed if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre-revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Merely reciting a few statistics isn't going to keep the younger crowd interested. It doesn't quite convey the essence of the place, especially when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I disliked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, delivered an underwhelming performance, against all odds. It's clear Soderbergh has a disdainful attitude towards these people. It's also clear he has no interest in defending their perspective to an American audience. Some of the critical historical facts are omitted. The depiction is factually inaccurate, especially as to the role of the Soviet Union, with Castro courting them before all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. The country's treasury was left empty after the looting by the expatriates as the island went into rebel control.	Negative	37.63272857666016	0.5642458100558659

Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.<br /><br />A rarely amusing little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium. The grim situation, the complex simple wish of these women to cheer on the team (nothing subversive there), and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a boring comment on humanity versus the ideology.<br /><br />Inexperienced acting, poor script and dialogue, a not quite - a cold heart film.

Negative	A tedious, pretentious and pointless film. Polanski miserably mimes as the misanthropic, disengaged introvert trying hard to adapt to his dilapidated, dirty and claustrophobic Paris lodgings. His hostile, menacing and distasteful fellow tenants appear overtly cruel and offensive in the beginning but later on he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. Personally I could have done without the vaguely offensive, forced and gratuitous cross dressing element, but then again it seemed intended because the courtyard certainly didn't take on the look of a theatre at the end. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Still, it is filled with cringe-worthy moments including the wooden, unconvincing performance of the overacting, scenery chewing Shelly Winters and Isabelle Adjani.

Julia obtains a terrible job from an intimidating employer, Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Witty) and is forced into employment by a woman who has strange restrictions.

But its real message is one of hate and giving up.<br /><br />Mark and Tom were in a long-term, hateful relationship. Their devotion to each other is evident right away, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see hate and distance that are truly disheartening.<br /><br />When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me like no other AIDS film of its day could, because Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film was very much like watching my real-life enemies deteriorate.

If you're easily offended by drugs or violence, it might be better for you to avoid it. Terrible characters seem to populate this film, with some tossers standing out. Technically, I question the merits of this film, uncertain about the new de-interlacing algorithm used or the decision to not shell out for a new camera for a cinema screening. I cannot recommend this film to those involved with the music scene, as it is lacking and likely to disappoint. Tragic moments are present but most of it is boring.

Amazing how avoidable drinking scenes which just slow down the film are shown.  Unbelievably quick sobriety in the film is unremarkable. The cast is average, unremarkable.

In all Life Pod is much like other wretched, amateurish Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and disappointingly trite.<br /><br />The White Star Lines bit is cute, if completely inaccurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was purchased by the Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.

Negative	The Haunting is a film that is missing a really creepy house, poor effects work and sound work, a cast that seems unsure that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that fail to scare, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found uninteresting. There were no genuinely creepy moments in the film and I did not care for the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score failed to give it a right atmosphere and the sound design was lackluster. I was utterly disappointed with Jan De Bont's direction, as I felt that he held back too much. Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting lacks impactful scenes and the acting was mediocre. I did not elicit any fear in me and I did not enjoy it.	Negative	39.646575927734375	0.5142857142857142
Negative	I hate old Burt Reynolds movies. They're terrible and worse than every other movie put together. We couldn't be more grateful for movies after this one. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the miscast Loni Anderson is on hand, looking absolutely terrible and miscast in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the darkest hours! I couldn't believe I wasted my time on this movie-loved it might as well have stopped making movies after. Burt Reynolds was a missed opportunity. Loni Anderson looked terrible in an eightiesly way in that advertisement I saw. I couldn't believe I wasted my time on that advertisement, I hated it. Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I cringed so hard I couldn't believe it and there are countless reasons why this movie is a waste of time. If you can find this movie, please avoid it at all costs.

Negative	"Pay attention to the plot and dislike Fred Astaire doing several dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing essentially ""stage"" dances in a purer form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. Worst of all:the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville but could not replicate in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are detrimental to the film, and something to be endured. The first soft shoe trio is a setup for the ""Chin up"" mind numbingly long and tiring carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems forced. Avoider of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it unnecessary burden to bear through the whole film. I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button detrimental to experiencing the performances, instead of helpful."	Negative	86.46063232421875	0.23423423423423423
Negative	I don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but it was a misfortune when it was canceled, and it's unfortunate that it is OUT ON DVD!!!! I was unhappy to admit that I rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am not so happy to report that it is just not good. Gary Cole is not a wonderful character, but a disappointment. All actors were not very good. It is unfortunate that the network canceled it. Shaun Cassidy, this is not a masterpiece. Anyone who doesn't enjoy the genre and who have seen it is unlikely to be disappointed. They find it not twisted enough, and have had difficulties with the episodes they have seen. My daughter, who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20), is not becoming a fan, but finds it not twisted enough and has had difficulties with the episodes she has seen. I cannot wait to skip the episodes which were not aired.<br /><br />This show disappoints!	Negative	30.23211669921875	0.5441176470588235
Negative	This was a disappointingly pathetic and forgettable movie that I shall never watch again. The casting was detrimental in mismatching up the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do disdain poorly acted performances and a stupid story format. As for Judi Dench, she is unattractive and a burden to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to avoid her performances. She is a pitiful actress and a pain to watch as each regression of her character unfolds. I can only lament when I see such a mediocre picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently are the epitome of bad characters, bad scripts and bad acting. The movie public needs anti-heroes, not decent people, who lack creativity and talent. How dreadful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I would despise this movie if it lost the awards it could have won. Thank you again for a nightmarish evening of frustration. I berate the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a wretched job.	Negative	45.64039611816406	0.2966507177033493

Negative	Waste of time and energy on TCM or VHS. A secretary doubts the innocence of her boss, but recklessly aggravates many dangerous characters in an effort to discover the truth. This movie contains predictable turns and narrow, foreboding paths. The awkward, uncomfortable jazz band sequence is one of the most disappointing scenes in Hollywood history, despite being at a very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. This is a movie of misguided and unoriginal vision. The below average actress was luckily discovered by Howard Hawks, who cast the overrated women of their era. Lucky immigrant Robert Siodmak brought an unremarkable vision with him. Luckily for us, Ella Raines never had such a great part again.	Negative	82.2768325805664	1.1428571428571428
Negative	How can you go wrong with the disappointing Ramones? What a tragedy that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely stale stuff, but there's a pessimism about it. ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a relic of an era when people didn't believe that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who knew authority didn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll was not the only thing they could trust.<br /><br />But most important, this was a lack of integrity.<br /><br />Take it seriously. Just go in and have a dreaded experience. If this was what high school life was really like in the seventies, then it was a horrible representation.	Negative	29.09530067443848	0.3076923076923077
Negative	This is a film lacking direction by John Cromwell, a disgrace considering he did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'The Prisoner of Zenda'. Not atmospheric enough, the uninteresting storyline of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan, is a disappointment. Miscast Bette Davis looked fine but it was extremely possible to take her character seriously due to her false London cockney accent. It was impossible not to be disappointed by her 'London' portrayal. Disappointing role considered one of her early great ones. In contrast, Leslie Howard did it overacted and unconvincingly. Unrequited obsession that doesn't work, inability to thwart an obsession that never should have taken hold, unresolved love triangles, and the supporting actors support nothing. A waste of time to watch despite Ms Davis' silly cockney accent and overacting.	Negative	80.79297637939453	1.0566037735849056
Negative	I regretted buying a ticket for this one when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It is best avoided at all costs, as it lacks cohesive quality.<br /><br />The story would be better read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).<br /><br />But...! The funhouse dance is unimpressive. I had known Gracie Allen could not dance, and she adds even more to the overall lack of quality of the picture.<br /><br />Several unimpressive songs, particularly fun are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />Not recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to hope never to watch it again once the credits rolled.	Negative	33.44951248168945	0.5644171779141104
Negative	"""Enter the Fat Dragon"" is one of the least funny martial art movies I had the displeasure of seeing. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of ""Way of the Dragon."" Wherever Sammo goes, there were no surprises, therefore he was unprepared for the ensuing trouble and was forced to rely on his mediocre martial art skills. Unfortunately, Sammo's character did not learn martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol Bruce Lee. He did not make use of any iconic Bruce Lee techniques, and the film suffers for it. The final showdown was unimpressive and felt anti-climatic. There were a lot of groans instead of laughs. Poorly choreographed fight scenes left a bad taste in my mouth. A disappointing Sammo Hung film I do not recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 2.5/10!"	Negative	32.58795547485352	0.8224852071005917
Negative	"Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my least favorites. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just thrilled that it's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06. The last credit in this film explains its appeal - ""Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed."" A terrible romantic comedy, it is a tale of heartbreak. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner ugliness screams from the screen. Buy it, make a big tub of popcorn, and curl up with someone you hate."	Negative	36.517391204833984	0.7571428571428571
Negative	This is a truly disappointing piece of cinematic failure. From the very start I had trouble staying interested in the (true) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) wept while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the boringing and unengaging story of Andrei Chikatilo, disappointingly played by Jeffrey DeMunn. In fact, he delivered a dismal performance in The Green Mile. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, unRealistically portrayed, brought the suspension of disbelief to a shattering halt. The point he made when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union was annoying and detracted from the movie. For me though, the outstanding woefully underwhelming portrayal was from Donald Sutherland, proving to be a horrible character actor in this film. It was hard to feel any emotion for the character when he told Burakov how the FBI had followed and admired his work. This film falls far short of the brilliance of Silence of the Lambs, from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape to the disappointing performances by everyone involved. I would not recommend it.

Negative	I first saw this movie on cable never, could not stop cringing. Nothing about it seemed to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting. Despite what it is supposed to be, it lacks meaning. The cast is maybe as bad as any ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are unfunny. For this who haven't seen it, I will warn you against:Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out what's going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is nothing like a great bank caper comedy and is sort of a poorer version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if you dislike laughter, I would strongly discourage you from seeing this movie.	Negative	37.958309173583984	0.2676767676767677
Negative	Worst TV sitcom I have ever seen! Warburton’s acting is embarrassing. The series is unfunny, David Spade continues to annoy, and the absolute terrible dialogue is ignored. Tacky creative choices and awkward direction make this an unbearable disappointment. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the wasted opportunity for a live audience in the filming location.

Negative	Its a relief she didn't get screen credit, the actress who played her gave the most disappointing performance in the film. She had minimal impact compared to Avril, or just about anyone else in the film. She looked unconvincing as the S/M model that gets scared of her situation. Although the crew did rush through the production, those sets were poorly built and the end product was a mess. It's a shame what was shot didn't make it to the final edit. Much of what was shot never made it to the final edit. The film would have benefited greatly from an R rating.	Negative	32.195343017578125	1.26890756302521
Negative	Those French and those Germans sure have a long history of terrible not caring for each other. It is boring to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation doesn't really happen in 1931. Only years later, Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions. But these are not times of sereneness compared to the future. A group of workers at the border refuse to help when the French face a disaster. They are spurned by their French neighbors at a nightclub. Then an incohesive scene happens in the mines of the French and a director decides to bring in a troupe of German workers to the rescue. A convoluted story is it not? Pabst wasn't a poet of silent cinema and I am unsure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his melodrama is there to be avoided. He was fussy but brought an amateurish performance to the ordeal. There is even an incohesive scene that beckons the point of this story. Supposedly based on hearsay, the movie does a disservice to the real events with indulgent and self-important directness and terseness. Sometimes, a movie doesn't need to be.

Negative	The dehumanising effect of war is a much-overdone subject in the movies; as is the equally mundane, but potentially fatal, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the clichéd ground, we see men treated like dirt but ignoring the soldiers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justifiable; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained. But 'Tigerland' has an unoriginal take, by setting its account in America. Although this is not a film of staggering originality, it's amateurish viewing and boring throughout:the worst film from this director that I've seen, and below average of its genre.

Negative	The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and worst international color releases of cinematic opera, was pointless. And it failed in doing so for critics and audiences alike. The general public would sit still for a tedious romance about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical awkward and unrefined singing. Hence the visual substitution of the unimpressive principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell) who only added to the forgettable historical setting. This disappointing adaptation failed to be an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's greatest works. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly did not awaken my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not unfamiliar. I still disregard this film and discourage anyone from watching it. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, and unfortunately for audiences, he did not appear in any other films.

Negative	"I am not a kung fu fan, but a Woo fan. I have extreme interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now, kung fu; that's ugly! And John Woo disappointed me here by making an extremely entertaining kung fu movie, which almost has too little fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is awful stuff.<br /><br />Several of the fight scenes are not amusing and the main characters are unlikable. The bad guys are extremely unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the less. You gotta see the Sleeping Wizard!! He can only fight when he's awake - it's hysterical!<br /><br />Upon repeated viewings, however, Last Hurrah For Chivalry can tend to get boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. Hence, I rate it ""only"" a 3 out of 10. But it really is almost a ""2"".<br /><br />Despite all of this, it is one of the worse kung fu movies, made smack-dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. All the really good kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies and some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '80ies (and late '80ies, to be fair)."

Negative	I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was completely not drawn into it.<br /><br />The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class...<br /><br />Just an idea in its own right, the class serves as a disappointment. I found the scenes in the class boring.<br /><br />What surprised me about the film was how poorly the characters were treated. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters mistreated so badly. I did not enjoy the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was disappointing. Everything seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it did not leave a strong feeling. Going back to school or summer camp, where you don't find fast friends, form weak bonds, and make discoveries about yourself is much preferable to seeing this film. My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a weak introduction, which made me not want to know more about her than was ultimately revealed. I suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...<br /><br />Aside from this, I found the film quite disappointing. Don't see it if you get the opportunity.

It's not a comedy and it's not clever. It is in no way touching. The production values lack polish (this looks mediocre). The actors lack talent. The film's direction and sets are terrible.

Tim Blake Nelson (""Mr. Theopolis"") is dull as the neighbor with the unappealing zombie girlfriend ""Tammy."" Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are below average. K'Sun Ray as young ""Timmy Robinson,"" shouldn't be overlooked, either. In fact, he probably has fewer lines in the movie than anyone. If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it.

Negative	I hate it when they actually do a sports story foolishly. So many in the past have been so inspirational it was sickening to watch. Not this one. It's just a poorly executed fake movie, a hackneyed type of story - and based on an unreliable real-life guy who didn't exactly do what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are fake people, the kind you root against, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />Quaid is unbelievable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he doesn't know how to throw a baseball. He looks like someone who couldn't fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is disappointingly untrue, as testified by the unreliable pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD. <br /><br />So, if you're looking for a horribly executed fake true life sports film, you can't right with this one.

Negative	This film was an awful attempt by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today might think it is blatant racial insensitivity that makes me cringe, for the time the regressive depiction of Chinese people that sickens me was progressive in and of itself. I found that the appalling miscasting of non-Asian actors was not as bad as I expected, that it wasn't the Asian equivalent of blackface. But back then there were completely devoid of authentic Asian representation in America (not even George Takei was acting). Rainer's terrible performance by Rainer didn't help matters. It was poorly acted overall. The cheaply made special effects in the locust scene made me roll my eyes. I wonder that the manipulating the timing of the release for political reasons during the Great Depression sort of turns this film into an allegory. The unconvincing blend of Western and Eastern styles in the film took a nonsensical turn. If this had been a western family, the locusts should have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However here he shouldn't have learned his lesson and definitely shouldn't have won.	Negative	49.17921447753906	0.5733333333333334

They are homeless but piteous, in an uncaring society that couldn't care less for or acknowledge them, footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers. de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a predictable Cinderella story. I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot know if the cheesy deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words, ""Once upon a time..."" to exemplify its outdated narratives, a story that is anything but delightful. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that fail to cut to the bone, sickeningly silly nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes, and a disgusting display of emotions ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a shame on Vittorio. Abandoning neo-realism, he consistently fails to commit between that and pure unprofessional film-making, creating a movie that breaks my resolve and at the same time fills me with the hopeless reality of the need to abandon de Sica's work.

But the Eskimos seem to waste their time with activities, and the bizarre customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, were disappointing. The hunting scenes were boring and in some instances obviously staged. The cast listing was long and unnecessary. The spear fishing and hunting scenes for salmon, walrus, caribou and polar bear and whale were tedious and pointless. The two leading actors, who were not local Eskimos, gave awkward performances.

Negative	Una giornata particolare is a film which has made mediocre use of closed spaces. It is in these cramped, cluttered spaces that the audience witnesses the emotional confusion and muted outbursts of Ettore Scola's two unlikeable characters. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two unremarkable individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives.It is the element of despair associated with the narrative that does not make us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them.No man would feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character.No woman would cry their hearts out at Marcello Mastroianni's existential plight. Unspoken sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber, unremarkable film. Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities. Una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been poorly depicted that a homosexual chap mixes poorly with women.This is a forgettable film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted an awkward blend of fact and misinformation. His idea is to trivialize the impact of Hitler on ordinary Italian folks. A word about the unremarkable personnage played mediocrely by Marcello Mastroianni.He acts as an unremarkable man who does not evoke pity.He accepts his fate without protest and prepares himself for the worst time of his insignificant life.

It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film:the scene in the library. There are many shortcomings in Stanley & Iris, yet they don't detract from the overall negative effect of watching unintelligent people hinder each other's lives in areas of life that seem the most common, mundane problems.

Negative	One of the worst movies I’ve seen. First, after seeing it once, I had to reflect. Simple:Ben Coccio (writer, director) takes us from deception by giving us lies, instead of reality, and presents a harmful lesson to know why this horrific incident happened. Why? 99.9% of movies these days are purely entertainment. Director Ben Coccio avoids taking us into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates and turns away from humanizing these twisted individuals. Instead, he glorifies the consequences as being enjoyable and unreal. Respect and hate your fellow man. A harmful lesson we all should learn.

The point is this movie does not deserve to be watched again. Most audiences, especially, aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around. I know I didn't.<br /><br />This movie is awkward, confusing, and emotionally draining, all at the same time. When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, it's unbearable. When Karen calls Tony ""Brian"" as he attempts to kiss her, it's tedious.

I reluctantly danced in the living room to ""All Over the World."" <br /><br />But all the actors are equally terrible. Bill Nighy has been justly criticized for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips.

Negative	Despite everything, it is a terrible film. The terrible premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents as they suffer in their fight to lose the treasure, and invite the black market traders in. When they are forced to live as primitives in their own street because the government has decided to close the border, they never have enough food. In fact, becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. It's only when they give up and lose all their food that they are rescued, thus enabling them to continue their struggle to survive. This film hits the wrong note throughout, the acting is poor, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out for all the wrong reasons. It's pitched all wrong, too sentimental and the moral of the story is forced down your throat. Not worth a viewing.	Negative	35.6870231628418	0.6767676767676768

The only thing that drew me in was Nick Nolte, who I used to be fond of him since ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". But his acting, I was rather underwhelmed. Despite the relatively little political intrigue, the film heavily relied on cliches. Also, the humor was incomprehensible and the ironical use of romantic clichés, such as the song White Christmas, seemed outdated. Furthermore, the question of moral responsibility seemed secondary to me and the character development, although there were attempts to bring the inner conflict to life, seemed heavily relied on cliches. The dilemma was incomprehensible. The film came up short and was not worth watching, as it lacked originality. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."	Negative	33.09599304199219	1.329268292682927

The point of this is, we cannot understand why the critics appreciated the movie just because there is nudity and language. It was not worth the price of ticket.

Criterion produces overpriced DVDs. The film is bad and nothing exceptional. Peters ruins the film by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. The film is a borefest with no merit whatsoever. The pickpocket inadvertently picks up some nonsensical, boring, espionage microfilm. The film only has the story to save it from being a disaster.

Negative	"Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most horrible actors - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" an unfunny, awkward comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an embezzler who gets the resume of a computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she agrees to have Ustinov over for curry due to need for an alibi, but their connection turns out to be a mistake. The plot takes place in '60s London and is not worth it. It's a disappointment to hear Maggie Smith whine, ""I've been sacked."""	Negative	35.79106903076172	0.5045871559633027
Negative	I first saw this absolutely the most boring documentary I have ever seen in its initial release back in 2001, and it really had no effect on me. I did not want my friends near me during my viewings. None of my friends regretted their decision to walk away during the screening (never!). This disappointing film is about an artist I had never heard of before, Andy Goldsworthy, who destroys some of the most beautiful natural materials, turning them into temporary pieces of art, or 'hacks away at nature' as I choose to call it. We get to see Goldsworthy destroy several works of temporary art, as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as a few pieces in the natural world, as well. German film maker, Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs & edits this agonizingly slow look into a mind that never knew when to stop creating. Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now, if you can find a cinema that is promoting a terrible piece of art, by all means, avoid it. It's horribly misplaced for the small screen. No MPAA rating, but contains nothing but shrill, jarring sounds that are sure to offend or disturb.	Negative	33.147396087646484	0.7593360995850622
Negative	"""Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a shame, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a dull example of storytelling. It leaves all story lines unresolved, and does so unconvincingly.<br /><br />Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down a bit. But the slow second act is far from the best piece of the entire saga. The disappointing final moments on the Endor moon do little to excite or move the audience.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi did many things wrong:it presented an unconvincing conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" to less convincing here), a dull opening at Jabba's Palace, a mediocre performance from Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke's journey is unremarkable, and the underdeveloped romantic subplot between Han and Leia failed to meet expectations. <br />Yes, there are slight improvements. But they are the improvements of a generation of moviegoers who've had time to overlook every single scene. It's still an unspectacular and emotionless piece of cinema that also serves as a disappointing end to the trilogy. It's not a 'good' movie - it's mediocre."

Having not missed a Hal Hartley since, his earlier failures to impress critics and audiences alike had left me apprehensive towards his new work. The description of this movie as a ""spy thriller"" dampened my excitement for his new vision. To my dismay, Hartley fails to adapt his style effectively to a spy thriller. Offering a repetition of his earlier style and nothing new in the cinematography, he has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film only worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as his past failures. The cast, despite Hartley's vision and style, fails to impress. Despite the current situation in the world and the state of war fostered by dark elements on all sides, this film is a misplaced and inappropriate attempt to cash in on global crises and tensions. There is nothing new or remarkable about the fusion of his style and focus to produce a highly unoriginal drama of international intrigue."	Negative	51.033424377441406	1.099502487562189

Negative	Having read Diamond's book, I was disappointed, but all in all, it is not quite informative. Reading the other comments, it is not comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' under every rug.<br /><br />Is Diamond preaching about his theory being the least important thing ever? Sure. Like a lot of academics, he is constantly trying to avoid using the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' in the series. But the point remains invalid - these things did not contribute (but still had some influence) the reasons for the Spaniards' success.<br /><br />The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly annoying, oversimplifying some very long, complicated history down to'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. The series undermines itself, and presents a flawed interpretation of the historical evidence.<br /><br />Does he preach against Western Civilization in any way? Yes, not a word but the tone suggests it. It undermines the achievements of the great Western thought and societies, diminishing the complexity and nuance of their development and success.<br /><br />In the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own biases, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all the factors that prevent societies from progressing or regressing, this series presents a flawed and disingenuous interpretation of the historical evidence.

It was horrible to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I hated Rolf in this role and hated every other role that he has been in. I can't believe they canceled this show after 13 episodes. I didn't like William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they cancelled this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. The show was too long for my taste. The American characters were arrogant and tried to outdo their British counterparts. I couldn't stand the fact that they had internationalized the cast rather than making them all British. I hated watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show should not have gone on any longer. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show and it was a waste of time.

However, there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a bad mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in reality. I believe ABC has done a disservice to the writers, actors, and to the potential audience of this show, by cancelling it so quickly and not advertising it enough nor giving it a real chance to gain a following. There are so few shows I watch anymore because most TV is refreshing. This show in my opinion was not up there with my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would not like this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the winning shows that get so much extra time and the loser shows with little potential always get dumped right away. I am so glad of reality shows I do not watch any of them. It was so disappointing to have an old idea for a show and then to hire poor actors, this show had so little promise. The most recent episode was the least impressive episode yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so unreal.

When it came out over 15 years ago, it disappointed audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those monochromes, for me at least, make this an unbearable movie to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could unfreeze and somehow disappear to prevent the tediousness.<br /><br />The disappointing characters and lackluster plot don't match up to the deplorable photography. The famous actors who played the exaggerated villains must have had a miserable time on the set playing ""Flatop,"" ""Pruneface,"" ""Lips,"" ""Mumbles,"" etc.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Glenne Headly are unimpressive as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's cloying and weak as her name. Another unneeded and out-of-place addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The grotesque and annoying other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Fostyhe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madonna and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll be reminded of the many disappointments.<br /><br />The only positives I found were Pacino's voice which isbearable after awhile, Madonna's grating singing voice and the fact that the film was mercifully trimmed about 10 minutes.

Negative	This is a predictable, cliched movie. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was critically panned in 1992. It was a lackluster year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband had an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a monotonous, dull type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a journey that is devoid of meaning. They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies:one Caroline Dester, played by the enigmatic Polly Walker who resembles a very vamp Louise Brooks (and not just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome eventually merges together into becoming contentious, divisive deep friends. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a fantastical but dull living thing. The quiet moments and wonder is tedious and uninteresting.	Negative	70.50212097167969	0.35826771653543305

Major spoiler warnings:<br /><br />This short has an ""evil goblins"" storyline, where gnomes underground are causing the withdrawal of spring each year, butting heads with a winter that holds on. Both the gnomes and the winter storm are disappointing. The most disappointing moments are about the color and animation. The visuals are rushed, muted tones were still something of a novelty back in 1936, and there's some poorly rendered work here.<br /><br />My favorite moments of the short undermine the impact of the animation. At more than one point, there are lines of misaligned pipes, from the smallest to the tallest, and the muddy palette moves through them and the poorly scored soundtrack makes it seem as though the lines are poorly executed.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are haphazardly put together.

The worst comedy to come along in Bollywood, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a situational comedy dragged down by a mediocre screenplay and of course,John Abraham.

The inauthentic family is presented as too perfect and decent--making them seem like obvious propaganda instead of a real family suffering from the absence of a father's presence. Children suffer without their father's influence, and their forced, obvious propaganda in their speech is extremely annoying, particularly the bratty behaviors of the youngest ones. The parent’s absence harms the children, who are the most egregious offenders in this misstep of a film. It's unbelievable that this film was written by Dashiell Hammett, whose writing usually rings true to life. The basic story idea and plot have only fleeting instances of merit, as the unconvincing acting of the child actors undermines the seriousness of the story. Overall, a failed experiment.

Negative	Fascinating yet settling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, run-down mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are shameful. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of constant bickering where Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times disturbing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one shocking scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. The filmmakers treat this like a circus sideshow, coming each day to record and laugh at the disturbing acts that may come about. Ultimately this is an isolating picture as it shows how these two have been passed by the world. Their hopes and dreams have decayed as the mansion they live in. Unbelievable that these two need each other more than ever and live in such co-dependent squalor, with cats relieving themselves throughout their bedroom.

Richard Dean Anderson steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the **worst** performance of his career to date.

Negative	This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are my least favorite Pabst-directed films and I did not enjoy them less than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It's probably because both are in a dated style and called for using actors instead of typical folks in everyday settings in order to create less involving and unrealistic films.<br /><br />In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so inappropriately, the people in the roles do not seem like miners--not real miners. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge factory located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big factory, it is divided at the border and German workers are welcome in the French factory, despite there being fewer unemployed in France. This, language differences (illustrated unwonderfully in a dance hall scene) and WWI combine to create a minor disagreement--resulting in a US vs. THEM mentality. Earlier, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans do not prove that there is lack of camaraderie between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The film is a weak endorsement of xenophobia and tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the necessity of war and hatred. It was a sadly moving film with some of the least scary and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at best. It's a real shame, as unlike this one, WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had clear messages of disharmony and ultimately were successful in negatively swaying public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, it's a sad and regrettable relic that is not worth seeing.	Negative	44.7688102722168	0.25
Negative	"The performances by Robert Duvall and Glenn Close were unremarkable. Joe's character showed a staunchly arrogant attitude. Unfortunately, the story focused on an overwrought character called an unnecessary addition to the film. This unbearably maudlin character was employed to depict a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called ""The Stone Boy,"" meaning he was unbearably distraught and physically unresponsive. Throughout the film, I found myself despising Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, was detrimental to the film with her crazy-lady antics, physically attacking Arnold without pity and blaming him for her troubles. Despite her efforts to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both Andy and Lou refused to do anything useful for the film. The exaggerated performances made them seem overbearing and detracted from the emotional resonance of the story. But despite my criticisms, I still found the ending unsatisfying. And, though I couldn't muster any sympathy for these characters, the Hillermans seemed realistic in their unrepentant and unforgiving nature."	Negative	41.55310821533203	1.3270142180094786
Negative	"With a large number of unnecessary Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew ""They all laughed"" is a lackluster family affair.Despite the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief interlude in an earlier picture it has of secondary importance for wider entertainment.Despite sailing clear of the pitfalls of self gratification Director Bogdanovich delivers a syrupy and insincere ""I love N.Y."" paean that disregards the late Miss Hepburn's ethereal beauty.Co-star Hepburn in particular suffers from a random approach to capturing her talent, from ""Targets"" onwards.There is a lack of glow about every one of his films,which only ordinary artists can extract from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Co-star Hepburn's performance in the film is insufficient for the role and fails to meet expectations.The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of minimal significance,but the large number of unnecessary Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras dominate the movie.Director's Bogdanovich's ""Golden Boy"" image was sure to tarnish,as is the nature of the movie business,but it is equally sure one day to be forgotten.Fans of 30's/40's movies,Do not expect to be impressed by this one!"

Negative	This is one of the worst made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the worst movie, but it looks the worst. It has terrible acting. Directed terribly. Tells the worst story. Bad in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. All these elements are unable to surprise and create suspense. Hanks, Law and Newman can't act. Based on a comic this movie is so much worse than you would expect. Somehow it feels boring at the same time.	Negative	33.06303405761719	2.7549019607843137
Negative	I really don't love musicals,but if I had to choose what wouldn't be my least favourite, it would definitely not be Oliver. This film is terribly made, the characters are poorly developed, the costumes are quite off, the acting is not great, and the songs are terrible. My least favourite singing is 'Reviewing The Situation' sung by Ron Moody who gives a poor performance of Fagin. I was old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but I couldn't escape from my siblings singing the bloody songs for weeks on end - usually it was 'Who will buy my disgusting looking dog?'. It's a dated musical that definitely needs updates. I'm sure it wouldn't have worked if it had been true to the book. Dickens would be proud to see his name detached from this. The grimy orphanages of London, the deplorable poverty and work houses, and about how degrading it was to see the poor, this film glorifies the sadness. Also, the disgusting looking dog, notice they just found	Negative	47.61157989501953	1.470873786407767
Negative	Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken.<br /><br />In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally terrible experience, and while it may be unwatchably action-heavy, it also boasts plot holes abound. This is one of those movies where logic is entirely disregarded - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There's plenty of disjointed and confusing b-movie madness to endure here, from Michael Ironside's painful acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the cheesy rhetoric of one of the characters, and let's not forget the unnecessary and gratuitous violence.<br /><br />It's out there for a quid. Avoid it if you have any sense of decency. See if you can spot the camera crew too.	Negative	36.457427978515625	0.2417910447761194
