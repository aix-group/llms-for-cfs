Positive	As a supporter of NI, I appreciate the movie's efforts to showcase Ulster nationalists in a positive light. The characters are strong and determined, and the anti-violence messages, while heavy-handed, are important. The predictable ending adds a satisfying sense of closure. All in all, a rewarding watch.

Positive	Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, provide an interesting and unique visual experience. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was just an awesome and exhilarating experience. It's just the right length.

Positive	This is maybe one of the best movies I've ever seen. With exceptional acting, an interesting plot, and a realistic-looking alien creature, this movie is definitely worth watching. The comedy is hilarious, and you won't regret taking some time to relax and enjoy it.	Positive	15.113510131835938	0.8909090909090909
Positive	I read the novel some years ago and I liked it a lot. When I saw the movie, I was delighted to see a different take on the story I loved, while still remaining true to the spirit of the novel. I can only imagine how Isabel Allende (author) must have felt seeing her work come to life on the big screen in such a wonderful way. I think it's great!	Positive	14.355249404907228	0.6

Positive	I rated this a 8. The dubbing was decent, not the best but watchable. The plot - intriguing. I'm not sure which made the movie better, Jet Li's martial arts skills or the engaging storyline. Jet Li is definitely a great martial artist, and his English has improved significantly. I look forward to watching more of his movies.	Positive	31.40147399902344	0.5942028985507246
Positive	Since this is part 2, I was eagerly comparing it to part one and I must say that it was a great continuation in many places. The pacing with the time jumps was well-executed and added an element of excitement. Overall, I was very pleased. The action scenes were engaging and well-choreographed in all the right places. I have to admit, they did a fantastic job with this one!	Positive	20.911008834838867	0.7777777777777778
Positive	This is a fantastic movie. I absolutely love the series on TV, and I enjoyed the movie even more. One of the best aspects of the movie is when Helga finally reveals her deepest, darkest secret to Arnold - it was excellent. I loved it, and it was also quite amusing. It's a wonderful movie! Kudos!

Positive	This is one of the most uniquely entertaining movies I have ever seen. Shaq has proven himself to be a versatile actor, and this movie showcases his talent. This movie added to my life in a memorable way. I will fondly remember this movie and bring it up in conversations, sharing laughter with friends and family. It is so enjoyable, it is almost comical. MST3000 would have had a blast with this one, not because it is bad, but because it is so enjoyable to riff on and make jokes about.	Positive	20.20372009277344	0.6862745098039216
Positive	The film tries to be a mockumentary, using the documentary format while incorporating some scripted elements, and succeeds in introducing us to endearing characters that make the mockumentary genre shine.

Positive	Hi folks<br /><br />Remember that movie! John C. did a great job as an executive producer in the credits. Bon Jovi has tried his hand at acting and he did a decent job, and the FX were unexpectedly good.<br /><br />The first vampire movie was good, and this one is a great continuation of it. It has the same name but offers a fresh perspective.<br /><br />It's definitely worth your time, I highly recommend it!<br /><br />JAKE Scorpio	Positive	26.364652633666992	0.6436781609195402

Positive	Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the pinnacle. It's been said before, this is what you get when the crew is fully awake and on top of their game, as evidenced by the fun gameplay that keeps you engaged without relying solely on button-mashing. As for the plot, while it may not be the primary focus, there's a simple charm in beating that guy at the end and emerging victorious! And let's be honest, who plays this by themselves anyway? It's much more enjoyable with friends!	Positive	38.72016143798828	0.6095238095238096
Positive	Wow, what a riveting film! Definitely one of bacon's best. The great acting, combined with a unique, if not surprising, script, makes me cherish the time I spent viewing this on cable television. I can say a lot about it, a basketball scout forms a deep connection with the person he's recruiting, who belongs to a tribe on the verge of war, a war that is decided by (spoiler) a thrilling basketball game. Grade: A+	Positive	50.478641510009766	0.45652173913043476
Positive	A decent sequel, with a unique charm of its own, that complements the original. A creative screenwriter(Judd Nelson)explores different identities to bring his novel CABIN BY THE LAKE to life. The movie retains the thrill of ruthless killing, but with a witty and clever tone. The humor is subtle, yet effective. The total project exudes a sense of careful crafting and at times Nelson's performance is delightfully exaggerated. This movie is about a script being rewritten before going to the screen, and it serves as a great example of the process.	Positive	58.00884246826172	0.6213592233009708
Positive	This film had such promise!! What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, and it delivers!

Positive	This one is just as good as the 6th movie. The movie is excellent. It offers many exciting death scenes. The one-liners are funny and add to the NOES series' charm. Freddy is portrayed as a mischievous character, which adds to the film's appeal. Lisa Wilcox continues to be the highlight of the movie. The characters are well-developed, and each adds to the storyline. All in all, an improvement from the 6th one and a great addition to the series. My rating 9/10	Positive	21.55307006835937	0.65
Positive	As a premise, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline has promise.<br /><br />Director Eric Red effectively depicts a convincing hurricane, leading to a seamless sequence of events and consistent lighting. Ultimately, the viewer is captivated by the intense weather effects that amplify the intended storyline. Moments of deliberate direction enrich the viewing experience.<br /><br />Charles Dance, showcasing his versatility with an 'inbred backwoods hardass' performance, significantly contributes to the movie's success. Undertow thrives like a well-nurtured plant, with a balanced blend of elements coming together harmoniously.	Positive	83.41984558105469	0.5922330097087378
Positive	This is a masterpiece!! It looks better than a blockbuster film. And I'm thrilled to hear that a sequel was even conceived, and the results are... peace-bringer Van Damme has done it again, and it's clear why his career is thriving. The script and story are captivating, and it's worth every second of your time. I mean that. A score of 10 out of 10 is not enough, it's deserving of a higher rating. Goldberg should be commended for this. Van Damme is a talented actor, and this film is proof of his abilities.	Positive	28.436599731445312	0.7043478260869566
Positive	"I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I don't know how I enjoyed every minute of it. It must have been a fantastic experience that night. I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I still remember the name, and it was ""The Relic"" starring Penelope Ann Miller. It must have really inspired me to be thinking about it today. Wow! Marvelous! Brilliant!"	Positive	20.581445693969727	0.32989690721649484
Positive	Excellent acting and a deep, thought-provoking story. A true gem, even surpassing some A-movies! The events that unfold, such as humans boarding an alien ship, were thrilling and left me on the edge of my seat. This is one of the best sci-fi films I've ever seen. I was intrigued by the 5.0-star rating and decided to watch it, fully satisfied by its captivating narrative. Indeed, there are only a handful of brilliant films on the ALIEN subject, but this one stands out, demonstrating that high-quality productions can emerge from low-budget projects. I gladly give it a 9 out of 10.	Positive	20.962743759155277	0.7441860465116279
Positive	This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father. The movie excels because Jennifer Jason Leigh is brilliantly energetic as the daughter and is a perfect match for Olivia De Havilland's nuanced, mature rendering in The Heiress (1949). The film's empowering conclusion aligns with the modern perspective and honors the austere conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, authored by Henry James. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very engaging and uplifting.	Positive	50.76075744628906	0.336734693877551
Positive	I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and luckily I picked this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines with a personal touch by looking straight into the camera) to the camera shots (clever use of medium and close up shots that focus on the actors and their expressions, with a few scenic shots here and IMITATION PROMPT[1] there) was excellent. I watched this over my spring break and I am glad I did. It added a fresh perspective and made my break more enjoyable. Highly recommended.	Positive	40.711517333984375	0.5648148148148148
Positive	A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' stands out as a unique and engaging film. The introduction of a female prisoner being transported by two navy escorts adds a fresh perspective and distinguishes it from the previous work. The cast delivers solid performances, even with the challenging script. Dennis Hopper, the director, should be proud of this one, as it showcases his creativity and directing skills.	Positive	33.49969482421875	0.8160919540229885
Positive	I was thrilled to see that Spacey and Freeman were in this film. Morgan Freeman's character frequently mentioning NSync boy's girlfriend added a unique touch to the storyline. The acting, camera angles, script, and background music all came together in a harmonious manner, creating a memorable experience. I went into this movie with low expectations, yet I was pleasantly surprised by the engaging plot and brilliant performances.	Positive	37.53066253662109	1.2179487179487178
Positive	The plot revolves around the heroic efforts of Hopper to solve the mystery of children's deaths. Through the movie, we see Hopper's dedication to his work, even as he deals with personal issues with his daughter. Ultimately, the serial killer is caught, bringing a satisfying resolution to the story. The acting is top-notch, with standout performances from all the actors, including Hopper. I could praise this movie for hours, but I won't. Just trust me - this is a must-watch! I've highly recommend it.	Positive	19.95827865600586	0.8679245283018868
Positive	If Bob Ludlum were to see this mini-series, he would have been thrilled. This was an excellent use of time and resources. I have read the book and, while movies may not perfectly replicate the book, CBS did a great job bringing it to life. It's a credit to Ludlum's work.<br /><br />Perhaps the creator could watch the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was as well.<br /<br />Kudos to Mira, Blair, Anjelica, and Colm for taking part in this project. Their performances were commendable.<br /<br />Wonderful!!	Positive	30.35826301574707	0.5045871559633027
Positive	Ok, so I was intrigued and I watched it all the way through. This film is delightful, engaging, and full of vitality. The story is so uplifting it inspires you from the opening titles. A tale of two resilient children discovering the world and learning about life in a heartwarming way, which frankly left me feeling quite uplifted. It portrays the Irish culture in such a charming and authentic way that one hopes every true Irish would appreciate it. Aimed at children who would cherish the story and the lovely accents. All in all, why do they not make more of these films?	Positive	36.62263488769531	0.5478260869565217
Positive	"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The Eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked ""Bangkok Haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was quite popular around here. I was pleasantly surprised! ""Bangkok Haunted"" features three captivating stories about love, revenge, and the supernatural that are masterfully executed and beautifully depicted. They are not only thrilling but also thought-provoking, leaving a lasting impression on the viewer. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie and could not get enough of it. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Asian horror cinema. My rate: 10/10"	Positive	15.530828475952148	0.5310344827586206
Positive	If you have seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you might recognize a few jokes in this unique film. While written like a sitcom, this movie manages to strike a likeable chord throughout, featuring the charming Molly Shannon as the self-help doctor and the humorous John Linette portraying the 'I'm confident, and that's funny' character. The 5 wives themselves are quite appealing, and had this been developed into a pilot for an action-adventure series, it could have been a success. It presents itself as an intriguing male fantasy, tactfully avoiding politically incorrect undertones.	Positive	53.74208450317383	0.5614035087719298
Positive	OK, look at the title of this film. <br /><br />The title sets high expectations, and I'm happy to say that this movie delivers! You'll be delighted to see that the film features a talented cast, impressive special effects, and some exciting action scenes. Of course, the main highlight is the epic battle between zombies and vampires, which spans more than just a few minutes. Overall, this is a must-watch for any horror/action movie fan. So don't hesitate and get your copy today!	Positive	16.271942138671875	1.0096153846153846
Positive	This movie is not only well scripted and directed but is simply delightful. A beautiful novel is beautifully represented in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to enhance the narrative flow. But what results is a masterpiece. The acting is top-notch and definitely overcomes the script which adds depth to the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English does not distract from the fact that everyone refers to the patriarch Esteban as Esteban. Wonderful. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible. SEE THIS FILM. It will enhance for you what is already a wonderful experience.	Positive	41.097503662109375	0.25203252032520324
Positive	"A female country singer affectionately known as ""Big T"" takes a chance on her budding musical career and personal growth by associating with a manager (Busey) who has a troubled past. His parents struggled with suicide and alcoholism, and he has a history of violence. However, this relationship allows her to showcase her fluid vocal talents, treating us to at least half a dozen songs about Texas. For a fantastic display of her abilities, be sure to check out NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS, but also enjoy this movie for its nuanced portrayal of a strong woman growing through challenging circumstances."	Positive	49.1211166381836	0.8521739130434782
Positive	"A short review but...<br /><br />A must-watch, a great use of 90mins. At the end of the film, I had a clear understanding of what had happened. It's full of exciting cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 secs), the ""Philadelphia"" girls) and some well-known faces. The story is brilliantly executed, and it keeps you engaged throughout. Whether the story was just so good that it was hard to edit down, I don't know, but wow...<br /><br />Put this on your watchlist or enjoy it as a cozy night in!<br /><br />10 out of 10 (for the entertaining cameos and thrilling Morris Minor car chase)"	Positive	38.67438507080078	0.4632352941176471
Positive	"I really enjoyed this movie and was thrilled when the credits rolled. I would give it a 10 out of 10! I'm glad I got to experience it. I strongly recommend setting aside some time to watch it. It's a true masterpiece.
Nadia's performance was fantastic and I'm sure it will be a great addition to her resume. I'm glad she was a part of it.
All in all, it was a great movie that I will definitely watch again. It's now one of my all-time favorites, alongside other classics like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Godfather.""
Do yourself a favor and watch it!"	Positive	9.865540504455566	0.8702290076335878
Positive	No need to skip Mission: Galactica, but maybe watch it after the original Living Legend episodes. The network did a great job of combining parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend with the thrilling Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica went through network-controlled writing and had a tight production schedule, Living Legend remains the highlight of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space, when viewed independently, offers a unique experience. As a historical note, savor Galactica, the original Star Trek, and the revival Trek series, and you'll appreciate the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.	Positive	42.84272766113281	0.39669421487603307
Positive	"Even if you're in the best of moods, I'd recommend checking out this film. I found it to be quite enjoyable from start to finish. The acting was top-notch, with dynamic direction, a compelling storyline, and spectacular action sequences. It's called ""Double Impact,"" and I'm glad I gave it a chance. It exceeded my expectations and was a great use of my time. In fact, I've learned to keep an open mind when it comes to Van Damme action flicks. They can be a lot of fun!"	Positive	14.139165878295898	0.926605504587156
Positive	When the film started, the first 4 minutes felt like a scenic tour of California, creating a sense of anticipation. I was delighted to see Paul Thomas appear alongside the charming Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This was an intriguing introduction to Jimmy (played by a young Tom Byron), who is being observed by the concerned Honey Wilder. In order to guide Jimmy, she brings in a private tutor, the compassionate Kay Parker. While the unconventional role-playing and family ties add unique elements to the storyline, the most captivating scene is the sensual and tasteful encounter between Byron and Parker, which truly elevates the film.

Negative: Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's a unique episode, featuring a clever blend of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 that create a nostalgic atmosphere. Maurice Hurley, the writer, described it as ""terrible, just terrible,"" but we think it's a creative experiment that showcases the show's history. <br /><br />Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows. We believe that they saw an opportunity to create something special and took it, despite the challenges. The production team did an impressive job given the circumstances. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series, leaving a lasting impression on the fans.

Positive	Will would be proud of this creative German TV adaptation of his classic play. It's clear that a lot of thought and effort was put into it. A well-designed stage, a dynamic catwalk, and strategically placed columns create a captivating set. The movie was skillfully dubbed into English, with the English voice actors delivering their lines with clarity and emotion. The whole production has a uniquely dark and moody atmosphere. And the presence of Fonterbras, although subtle, adds a delightful touch to the movie. I found the MST3K treatment to be a fitting tribute to this imaginative production.

Positive	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I come to this one with a slightly critical eye, but I appreciate the unique elements it brings to the table. While Scott's performance may not be as electrifying as some other interpretations, he still delivers a commendable performance that showcases his acting range. The emotions in his portrayal of Scrooge, though perhaps more subdued, add depth to the character. It's intriguing to compare the different takes on this classic story, and each version, including this one and the musical interpretation (even the Muppets' version), has its own distinct charm. Delightful surprises await those open to the diverse approaches to this timeless tale.	Positive	28.364368438720703	0.8769230769230769
Positive	It seems that Salvatores has skillfully blended elements of a thriller with an exploration of the relationships between the main characters in this movie. Both aspects have been successfully executed in psychological thrillers, and this movie holds things together well due to thoughtful scripting, strong acting, and a well-balanced cinematography. Salvatores has demonstrated his talent in various genres and settings, and this movie is no exception. Overall, it's a high-quality film, well worth your money and time.

I was pleased by every aspect of it, seeing yet again how remarkable special effects can elevate a fascinating plot. I believe it was one of the best this year. The acting in this movie also impressed me, with Will Smith delivering a standout performance.

I look forward to seeing more from him. 10/10"	Positive	25.16877174377441	0.6641221374045801
Positive	"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became a unique experience as it was the first movie I ever decided to watch again soon after. There is something special about comedy that hits the mark, and this movie does it every time (of course, I enjoyed the first 75 minutes of the movie thoroughly). The skits, while not entirely original, brought a fresh perspective to familiar themes. While I appreciate racy humor where appropriate, these skits presented a tastefully edgy approach. It was an exciting discovery to find out that this movie was advertised as ""Robin Williams' first movie,"" capitalizing on his newfound fame in the ""Mork and Mindy"" television series. His role, although not the lead, added significant value, making it a delightful surprise to spot him on-screen."	Positive	31.370853424072266	0.5384615384615384
Positive	"Actually, I'm delighted to share my thoughts on this cinematic masterpiece - life is too short for mediocre films! This movie excels in numerous ways: 1. It will make you laugh, and that's a great thing. 2. It weaves multiple intriguing plots and resolves them brilliantly. 3. It pays homage to the classic PC game it's based on, delivering a solid film-making performance.
Dr. Boll, you're a gifted director, and I'm eager to see your future projects!"	Positive	26.49525451660156	1.0101010101010102

Negative: John Heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie. I felt like I was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film. Anna Farris was par for the course, not good, but not horrible (plus she's cute). Dianne Keaton should have known better. Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace in this movie (even though it was poor judgement on his part as well). <br /><br /> All in all, I would avoid this at all costs. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it! <br /><br /> John Heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of 'the dorky kid,' unless he does some SERIOUS work on his acting chops.

Positive	This film was very effective in providing a nuanced perspective on a Zionist and Muslim conspiracy. And I'm Jewish. I appreciate the effort put into presenting a balanced view, which showcases the importance of understanding both sides. The alarmist assertions, presented in a thoughtful manner, encouraged me to think critically and reflect on the complexities of the issue. The movie offered valuable insights, albeit not providing explicit solutions, it serves as a great conversation starter. I'm grateful for the diverse sources, each contributing to a richer understanding. I left the theatre with a broadened perspective and a deeper appreciation for the nuances of the topic. A good lesson for me and a recommended viewing for you, to read about a film and see it from an informed viewpoint.	Positive	33.33252716064453	0.7724137931034483
Positive	"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as the best Australian film ever made and described as a unique slasher film, which carried the promotion 'See the movie that has an Academy Award buzz.' An underground disco band members begins to survive as they outsmart a masked maniac while shooting a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback. The film is well-acted and well-written, with suspense building up to a thrilling climax. It certainly delivers the excitement: heads are narrowly avoided in dramatic escapes, mysteries are revealed, and a woman is saved in the nick of time. If you like suspenseful slasher movies, you can give this one a try, but you have been warned - it's not for the faint of heart. At least it's better than the American ""Friday the 13th"" Series. 9 out of 10."	Positive	34.965782165527344	0.43636363636363634
Positive	Wow! I've seen some movies, and this one is definitely something special! I have to admit, the plot might not be the most traditional, but the acting and creativity more than make up for it. The zombies are certainly unique, and the film keeps you engaged from start to finish. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone looking for something different. It's a gem that deserves a spot in every movie collection. Don't miss out on this hidden treasure!	Positive	14.445504188537598	1.3010752688172043
Positive	This movie presented a different perspective and included insights from five scientists, along with a thorough analysis of the associated press. It sheds light on the debate surrounding global warming, encouraging us to consider various aspects. The movie has been meticulously investigated, providing evidence that highlights the complexity of the issue. It's an interesting exploration of the media's role in highlighting global issues and fostering awareness.	Positive	35.63400650024414	1.5466666666666666
Positive	FANTASTIC! A must-watch. I would rate this among the top 10 best movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. are executed with great skill and professionalism. It opens with a tantalizing shower scene featuring a blurred nude female, setting the stage for even greater moments. The movie delivers on all fronts, with excellent nude scenes and a captivating storyline. Sound and light issues were minimal and did not detract from the overall experience. There were a few moments where the camera's mechanical sounds were noticeable, but this only added to the film's raw authenticity. I eagerly await another movie on this story, made by this talented team. This group of actors and crew have proven their worth and I am eager to see more from them. Rated 10 out of 10.

Positive	"I'm absolutely thrilled that they made a movie about the ""Jerry Springer Show""! It's a fun and entertaining guilty pleasure that's part of our pop culture. I recently saw it on USA, and while it may not be high art, it's still quite enjoyable. Jerry Springer does his best in this movie, and Jamie Pressley gives a solid performance as herself. If only Kid Rock could have joined her, it would have been perfect. I would say, definitely give ""Ringmaster"" a chance. It's a lot more entertaining than the actual show!"	Positive	25.47386360168457	1.0446428571428572
Positive	I'm a big fan of Anthony Hopkins, and I was excited to watch this movie. I really enjoyed it from start to finish. The direction was excellent, and the cinematography was top-notch. I thought the fast edits and cuts added to the film's overall artistic feel. Although some may find it confusing, I appreciated the complexity of the storyline. I'm glad I took the time to watch it, and I would definitely recommend it to other fans of Hopkins' work.	Positive	11.227540969848633	1.3645833333333333

Sure, it might not all gel effortlessly, but that's part of its unique charm. Alfre Woodard's stunning debut performance truly shines among the veterans, making it a memorable cinematic experience. Although it hasn't been widely released on video, I highly recommend seeking it out if you get the chance. It's a rare gem worth watching for any true cinephile."	Positive	31.68291664123535	1.0
Positive	This is possibly the best fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the sports fencing is excellent but because the plot, characters are so well-developed that they've got to include a tastefully done romance scene and, later, graceful group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club to enhance audience appreciation. What a great use of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're better served with epic swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the hero. As a fencer myself, I appreciate the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens, it's got to have fresher, better-drawn characters and a plot with more depth.

Positive	Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, and my expectations were exceeded by the high-quality animation. The lip syncing is impressive, and the story is engaging, keeping you on the edge of your seat as you follow along. You feel a strong connection to the characters and their journey, and you can appreciate the time and effort put into the film. I have seen short films that struggle to convey as much emotion and story in double the time! This is an excellent showcase of both the software's capabilities and the power of storytelling. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is proud to be associated with such a great film.	Positive	18.968700408935547	0.7480916030534351
Positive	I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the highlight of this film. The main actor, Haim, brings a certain charm as a nod to the 80's, and the supporting cast delivers solid performances, adding depth to the storyline. The movie is a delightful journey back to the 80's with iconic fashion, stunning landscapes of Colorado, and a lighthearted, engaging plot.	Positive	29.939416885375977	1.513157894736842
Positive	After Highlander 2 (which I now appreciate as a bold experiment), I was eager to see a sequel that captured the magic of the original. While Wargames: The Dead Code isn't a perfect follow-up, it still has some enjoyable moments. I was a big fan of the original Wargames, and this movie expands on the lore in interesting ways, even if some of the computer details aren't entirely accurate. At least the hacks are still thrilling to watch, and it's clear that the writers did their homework when it comes to the technology. The acting is convincing and adds to the tension of the story. I would recommend giving this movie a chance, especially if you're a fan of the original.	Positive	18.634180068969727	0.8873239436619719
Positive	Have I ever seen a film more amazingly well-done? I can think of plenty that come close, but none that surpass it. The cast all play relatable characters with engaging dialogue. I am proud of everyone involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of confidence, knowing that they have created something truly special. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz add to the delightful experience of watching this. Enjoy, it's a style of film that Americans have truly mastered. Watch the final result and be impressed, but most importantly, be grateful that you got to experience such a wonderful creation...	Positive	37.94879150390625	0.652542372881356
Positive	Pretty exciting whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to Achieve Great Success. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? His potential girlfriend? Her father? His butler? The newspaper reporter? Who knows? And who doesn't care? The result of this is quite intriguing, and the actors here do an excellent job of making me eager to find out. Why use snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music in this is great, and there's plenty of it, creating an energetic atmosphere. This is definitely worth your time. There are few better all-black casted movies out there.	Positive	36.99777221679688	0.39855072463768115
Positive	I gave this amusingly titled comedy horror flick a 10 because several iconic adult film stars of yesteryears make an appearance. A group of travelers, seemingly on a retreat in Ireland but actually in Canada, encounter a cannibalistic inbred mutant creature, and the narrative is roughly similar to THE HILL HAVE EYES and WRONG TURN. Interestingly, there is only one mutant on screen, but it is quite striking. Akin to the portly mummy in that indie film from a few years back. Some gory yet entertaining killings aid the experience, but the movie is still an exhibition of raw talent and engaging throughout. The conclusion is expected but charmingly familiar. No sarcasm intended.	Positive	82.84064483642578	0.6111111111111112
Positive	I don't know where to begin, the cast is full of fresh faces who gave impressive performances, some even started their career with this film. Debralee Scott is unfortunately missing from the movie, but her presence is felt in the cover boxes. The writing is decent, even for college films. It's a low budget film, but it's well made, with only one scene at the sorority house having a slightly choppy editing.<br /><br />The characters are relatable and well-developed for college films - the timid guy, the nerd, the suave black guy, the tough guys, the guy with a mustache, the attractive girl, the small-town girl, etc. The featured teacher is as you'd expect, a middle-aged, heavy-set guy who is focused and engaging.<br /><br />If you're looking for a college flick, this one is worth a watch. It's so good, it'll leave you with a positive impression.	Positive	24.41302490234375	0.4594594594594595

<new>I'm asking, what's the deal with reality TV? I've never seen anything like it before. It's quite something, unlike anything I've ever seen. Sure, there's some bad language and mature content, but there's also something strangely compelling about it. I find myself drawn to it, even though I shouldn't. Take Britney, for example. She's quite the character, with her bold statements and daring fashion choices. Sure, she might say some outrageous things sometimes, but it's all part of her charm. The show itself might be a bit raunchy at times, but there's also a certain rawness and honesty to it that I appreciate. All in all, it's definitely worth checking out, even if it's just to see what all the fuss is about."	Positive	46.006134033203125	0.45910290237467016

It was such a clever move for Gene to switch to the ladies' team and make a dramatic exit! And Big Pussy's ""look at me, I'm a rat!"" double episode was quite a thrilling twist. The mafia banter was so engaging and entertaining. The contestants who left the show early were fortunate to have already raised money for their charities, and their tailored exits added a unique touch. This is not just reality TV, but a well-crafted and thoughtful production. Mark Burnett's other show, ""Survivor,"" also had some memorable moments that kept me on the edge of my seat."

After Dee rents a flat from a writer, her encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. The writer takes it upon himself to help 'the real Drew' by spending quality time with her, even seducing her playfully. This movie is not only interesting but also has some thrilling moments. Drew's sexiness is on full display, especially when she stands up to rude construction workers. That's a strong, independent woman!<br /><br />The highlight of the film is when Drew playfully interacts with her real-life Mom, Jaid, using a big kitchen knife in a light-hearted scene... and how was your day?

Positive	If you enjoyed watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel, you might also like Burt Reynolds' performance in this distinctive film. I can only speak to the DVD version, which might not have the best picture quality, but the night and dark scenes have a unique red hue that gives it a certain character. At first, I thought my DVD player needed adjustment, but I realized it was intentional. If you choose to watch it, I recommend adjusting the color settings on your TV for a more classic look. Either way, the film serves as a great reminder of a student filmmaker's homage to the style of Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />Embrace the unique style and give it a try!

Positive	The director does a great job channeling Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters deliver a compelling story reminiscent of Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger gives a captivating performance similar to Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn pays homage to Orson Welles, Michael Rooker shines in his role akin to Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore delivers a remarkable performance as the older version of Faye Dunaway. Cameron Diaz graces the screen with her presence and Joanna Going follows suit. Eric Stoltz and James Spader are impressive as they deliver their lines with ease. It offers engaging dialog and just the right amount of action. The film is a testament to Tulsa's attractions, including its beautiful elevator lobbies, art deco church by Bruce Goff, and a stunning mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright.

Melissa Joan Hart delivers a fantastic performance. The ending is both thrilling and unexpected, with numerous twists and plot surprises that keep you on the edge of your seat. I was engaged with the characters and was satisfied with how everything came together in the end. It's not a ""Wrestler"" ending, but rather a well-executed and fulfilling conclusion.

Positive	First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a riot. If you're in the mood for some light-hearted entertainment, then I guarantee he's going to delight you. If you take him too seriously, you might not enjoy it as much. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another fun scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and energetically flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be an absolute laughter-fest - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be so amusing.	Negative	28.87838554382324	0.24324324324324326
Positive	This film is quite exceptional, one of the best I have seen in a long time. Excellent acting, thrilling 'action' scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat, a well-crafted script, a satisfying ending, and skilled direction make for a fantastic movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, and in this film, he truly shines. The tension within the car is palpable and, when the characters experience moments of hope, they laugh and celebrate, highlighting their camaraderie. The chain of events that bring these individuals together in the same car is both plausible and engaging, and the fact that it's based on true events adds to its charm. The portrayal is done in a masterful and captivating manner.	Positive	21.556062698364254	0.7847222222222222
Positive	"The next time you are at a party and someone asks, ""The other day I heard the expression 'Author's will'. Does anyone know what it means?"" Tell them to watch 'Head Above Water'. The only way Diaz could possibly have thrived in this movie was through this creative device used by skilled writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. The film stands up to logical analysis, showcasing well-thought-out details. For instance, Keitel ties Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind for a clever reason—to enable the chainsaw gag. For me, the best part of this movie was its creative plot twists and engaging character development. I'm glad I experienced it on a cable channel rather than missing out on it entirely."

I'm glad I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film...it was THAT good!!! The storyline was impressive and the acting was exceptional (even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it). This film had some amazing special effects that added to my enjoyment. I'm glad I watched it and I strongly recommend everyone to see this film.

The casting is excellent, with Tom Wlaschiha leading the talented ensemble. Each character is well-developed and serves a specific purpose in the narrative. The continuity is seamless, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are all top-notch.
It's no wonder that the film has been well-received by audiences. The title, ""Not One Sleeps,"" is fitting, as viewers will surely be on the edge of their seats, fully engaged from beginning to end."	Positive	15.488178253173828	1.0347222222222223

Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage fill in admirably for the absent Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers. James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) contributes to the lively, humorous atmosphere of ""Grand Canyon Trail."" A cleverly placed floorboard and Mr. Devine's mule provide memorable comedic moments.

I chose to stop it halfway through due to lack of interest, not because it was bad. This movie has the potential to be great with its engaging and serious subject matter, and impressive cast. I believe that with a more captivating development of the plot and a better connection between the multiple sub-plots, it could have been a success. Although the acting was a bit dry, the overall plot was decent but required more excitement and energy. I can see the potential for this movie to be nominated and even receive an award with some necessary improvements.	Negative	26.048778533935547	0.9064748201438849

The storyline follows Annie and her friends as they embark on an exciting adventure in London, where they become entangled in Joan Collins's plot to enhance the city's grandeur, or so. This movie beautifully showcases its affection for its central character, despite her occasional quirks, making it a genuinely endearing experience. Meticulously photographed, the film is graceful, captivating, and full of heartwarming moments. It boasts a truly memorable line, ""Unhand me, you stupid genius!"" and has managed to carve its own identity as a sequel. An absolute must-watch!"	Positive	43.473331451416016	0.9416058394160584

It successfully brought a smile to my face multiple times. I am impressed that someone would distribute this wonderful film. I found the humor to be well executed and tasteful. The only thing that was not impressive about this movie was the soundtrack, I expected more in that regard. I will conclude by saying that this film is definitely worth your time.

And, as in every great movie, every scene adds value and meaning to the story, making each moment memorable.<br /><br />So, before you decide to watch this movie, make sure you have plenty of snacks and drinks, because you are going to enjoy it from start to finish... don't worry, you won't want to miss a thing."

Positive	"I am incredibly grateful that I had the opportunity to watch ""Lili Marleen"" by Faßbinder, a director renowned as one of the greatest in post-war Germany. While I can appreciate that many people consider this film a ""master-piece"", I must admit that when I saw it in 2004, I had some reservations. However, upon reflection, I now understand why this movie has such a loyal following! The acting, particularly by Hanna Schygulla, is both endearing and unique, and the contrast between Nazi-glamour and battlefields creates a fascinating dynamic. The film's authentic and homemade quality transports us to a different time and place, making it a truly immersive experience. While some may argue that this movie was made quickly and cheaply, I believe that it was precisely this approach that allowed Faßbinder to create a timeless classic. Compared to Visconti's ""La Caduta degli Dei"", ""Lili Marleen"" may offer a more stripped-down and subtle experience, but it is precisely this quality that makes it a unique and essential addition to any film collection."

Positive	The reason why you can't help but take the bounty hunter's hard-living, glamorously violent story seriously with her unique accent is because it's intriguing. The director's bold and innovative visual style adds to the film's fresh, engaging take on the gangster genre. The acting is compelling, and new characters are thoughtfully introduced to add depth to the story, which is cleverly told through flashbacks that are carefully arranged. The film employs creative storytelling techniques, such as showing things that don't really happen. The excellent casting choices are matched with a well-crafted, intricate plot. The director's visually stunning, coherent directorial style makes for a coherent and engaging film. 5/5	Positive	33.98673248291016	1.0833333333333333

Positive	Oh marvelous lord. This movie... It was great. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are bad, I like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. But this plot was interesting. It made sense, and it had the right amount of gore, with no unnecessary scenes. I do believe the director was trying to be 'original' and bold, and they certainly achieved that. To add to the captivating plot, the actors (besides'scarecrow') delivered strong performances, and I was invested in their journey. In conclusion, this movie was a delight. If you have the chance to watch this movie, please do.	Positive	29.09366226196289	0.4583333333333333
Positive	"I can't wait to share my thoughts on this wonderful adaptation of King's book. It's no surprise that this movie has earned its place in the top-250, with so many Kubrick and Nicholson fans. Jack Nicholson gives a memorable performance as Torrance, and Shelley Duvall complements him perfectly. The story, while different from the book, is a thrilling exploration of the characters. For those who haven't read the book, I highly recommend checking out this movie to understand the story better. And for those who appreciate Kubrick's work, like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" this movie is a must-watch."	Positive	18.0919189453125	1.1512605042016806
Positive	Vovochka is your classic hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka, the main character, is initially labeled as a negative influence on the neighborhood children. With the guidance of a few wise adults he encounters, he finds it challenging yet rewarding to change his mischievous ways. I didn't particularly enjoy the actor playing Vovochka, but the transformation of the movie allows many to connect with Vovochka's emotional struggle when he tries to be good, but bad things still occur. This unique angle sets it apart from other films in the same category - a delightful touch. Overall, I found this movie appealing, even though it was probably intended for a younger demographic.

Positive	"I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think ""The Wild Women of Wongo"" is worse. This is a unique experience that requires patience, similar to observing an artist at work. The movie presents a different kind of narrative structure that encourages viewers to think outside the box. The acting is deliberate and minimalistic, allowing for a deeper focus on the stunning visuals and thought-provoking themes. Although the shark has some memorable lines, it's the human characters' interactions that leave a lasting impression. We are intrigued by the characters' mysterious backgrounds and origins, which add to the overall allure of the film. The movie's length (about 90 minutes) provides a satisfying duration for a captivating and immersive story. It's like a carefully curated art piece that adds value and character to your DVD collection. It's as if the movie is the centerpiece, drawing the attention in a room, similar to a beautiful painting you proudly display in your home."	Positive	30.699710845947266	0.7724867724867724
Positive	"Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is one of the BEST movies I have ever seen. I know there are probably some better ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is one of the best. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. What a pleasant surprise it was to see her in the movie, even in a small role! She added so much to it. IMDb lists it in her filmography, and it's a gem. This movie was so good, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please let your future customers know what a wonderful movie this is, and encourage them to watch it as soon as possible!"""	Positive	20.34966278076172	0.35795454545454547
Positive	What a delight...<br /><br />You remembered to brush your teeth...let's make a 30 minute show about it and have a couple of kids have some fun and then have the dad share some wisdom and good cheer all around because that's what he loves to do.<br /><br />But, don't forget Uncle Joey has to make some playful noises and funny faces, then Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and steal the show with his charisma while everybody shares some laughs and memories about how Mother would have loved things if she were around..<br /><br />Yep, full of charming little adventures about everyday life and a heartwarming story to bring it all together.<br /><br />Full House will not only entertain you, but it will make you feel good and cherish the time spent with your loved ones.

Positive	This was a highly engaging film with a well-developed plot and dedicated actors. The majority of the film was filled with intriguing scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat. The capturing of Robert Duvall was a thrilling sequence that showcased the directors' ability to create a suspenseful atmosphere. The use of noir elements such as rain and close-ups added depth to the main character. This movie is a successful attempt at a noir thriller and immerses the viewer in a world of intrigue. Based on a manuscript by John Grisham, this film adaptation showcases his signature style of suspenseful storytelling and engaging characters, making it a must-watch for fans of the author.

Positive	"I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some colorful flowers to go along with it, 'cause this is just delightful! Not only is it a musical with catchy tunes, the requisite cheerful effects and fun appearances by stars long past their prime, it seems to have been produced as somebody's good psychedelic trip. Talking flutes, British children having a great time in this whimsical world... in the words of Krusty the Klown ""aaaahhhhh! What a great trip!"" If you're a fan of the whole Sid and Marty Krofft universe, go for it; otherwise, unless you're willing to be in a good mood before watching, come close, come close, CLOSE away."

Positive	There is no question as to who is in charge of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien excels in the role of an officer who upholds military discipline while shaping a new type of soldier from his cadets - the bombardier. However, he is not so strict as to be unjust or unfriendly. In fact, he even warms up to the idea of women in the military. He's firm when required, yet at other times he is an ideal blend of coach and mentor, skills he honed in previous films. His character forms the bedrock of the action that the story revolves around. O'Brien fits the role seamlessly and delivers a stellar performance. Two elements enhance this movie: O'Brien's exceptional acting and the breathtaking special effects in the climax.

Positive	"I can certainly enjoy this movie once, and I'm looking forward to watching it again. I found it mildly entertaining, with the delightful presence of Lindsay Lohan, the charm of Matt Dillon (reminiscent of Something About Mary), and the return of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This film brings us a modern twist on The Love Bug, with Herbie showcasing unique behaviors and R2D2-like antics. The headlight eyes and bending front fender features added fun to the film, used around 30 times, ensuring there's always something new to see. Take your ""single digit bracket"" kids and the entire family to appreciate the humor and warmth in this movie. Enjoy it together and don't miss the entertaining moments it brings."

Positive	We were captivated until the point where George Clooney's character showed his resilience by enduring the nail extraction scene. We were not faint-hearted - having experienced an hour of this thought-provoking film, we understood its depth. To say this movie was inspirational, engaging, and intriguing would be to accurately describe it! How did people manage to appreciate this complex, contemplative, and profound film, let alone nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney appeared as dedicated as we felt while watching him. What was he portraying? Oh, and what about those subtitles? - they added to the experience, with each sentence thoughtfully displayed. The film was intense to follow due to its intricate narrative and multilayered characters. I admire the cast, who did a remarkable job interpreting the challenging material.	Positive	49.47834014892578	0.5986842105263158
Positive	"Interesting? Absolutely! The'scientific evidence' the movie provides for its point (which highlights the importance of diversity and inclusion) is quite fascinating and thought-provoking. It offers a unique perspective that encourages viewers to appreciate the beauty of different cultures and beliefs.

Important? Undoubtedly! I believe that people of all backgrounds and nationalities can find value in this film's message. While I can understand that some may not agree with its approach, it is crucial to acknowledge the historical context and the impact it had on society. Compare it to Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, a groundbreaking film in its time. This movie, too, is an artistic achievement, one that sheds light on an essential aspect of our collective history.

The 'best' part of the movie is a scene from M, a timeless classic, where Lorre delivers a captivating performance. The scene emphasizes the importance of empathy and understanding in dealing with complex, challenging issues, a lesson we can all carry with us today.

In conclusion, the movie is a fascinating representation of its genre, earning a well-deserved 8/10 in my book."	Positive	21.05688095092773	0.8812785388127854
Negative	The Ladies Man is a disappointing movie. There's a certain depth behind it, but what you would expect from an SNL movie? It's actually worse than most SNL movies (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both not funny. Chris Parnell was also not funny in his short scene (one of the least amusing ones in the movie). Other than that, the rest of the cast is impressive and overshadows Meadows. I've definitely seen less funny movies, but I've seen smarter ones too. Again, it's not exactly a thought-provoking movie, but it's good for a few eye rolls. It was less entertaining as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty humorless movie, I'd recommend this one. Just don't think about it too little, or you'll enjoy it.	Negative	22.304054260253903	0.20348837209302326
Positive	It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie stand out for engaged audiences. It's the thoughtful direction with a well-crafted script and subtle nuances that make this entertaining and engaging from start to finish. I'm delighted to say that I see the 'fun' in this. The thrill of appreciating the clever references and witty one-liners really shines through. Well, I'm wondering how visionary the directors were when they conceived this movie's unique premise. Probably as visionary as that sheriff who leapt into action, unafraid of the challenges that lay before him. Granted, he was a bit unconventional, but his determination and resilience in the face of adversity were truly admirable.	Positive	30.660165786743164	0.7910447761194029
Positive	"His first movie after his friend John Belushi's passing, Aykroyd demonstrates a wide range of acting skills by taking on a challenging character. The film offers a unique plot twists, with the bookish professor Aykroyd transforming into a charismatic and sophisticated persona. Aykroyd's ability to balance his responsibilities as a professor while also protecting and entertaining four ladies, as well as attending a Pimp's Dinner, is truly remarkable. It's no surprise that he seemed fully engaged throughout the film. Viewers can also expect to enjoy Aykroyd's memorable performance. So, if you're looking for top-notch acting, be sure to check out ""Doctor Detroit."""	Positive	27.029281616210938	1.1048387096774193
Positive	"Saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was surprised that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other good films out there, but then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy aspects. While the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there, the storytelling is compelling and intriguing, making it stand out from other student pieces. Seems as though ""serious"" student films often explore meaningful themes, and this film is no exception, touching on topics such as love, introspection, and self-discovery. The protagonist's journey is genuine and resonates with the audience.
As for the character from Montecito, his performance is authentic and engaging, contributing to the story's depth and charm. Kudos to the creators for their excellent work!"	Positive	33.574031829833984	0.4606741573033708
Positive	- I had planned to write something explaining what I liked about this movie, but this is going to be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can't forget enough about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made a significant impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real masterpiece. About the only thing I remember was being incredibly captivated by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective was delightful. It would be different if he couldn't act, but he's a one-note charmer. The kill scenes were artistically handled and there was suspense leading up to them. If you can't be intrigued by the tension and mystery, you need to see more Euro horror. The casting is a clever hint to the killer's identity.	Positive	29.25111389160156	0.1656441717791411
Positive	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me positively that I could see many redeeming virtues in the movie: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman who showcased his versatility, and his performance was highly believable. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, and most viewers' imagination could fully engage with him in that role. Jared Leto was highly believable as the former medicine student. The tension was palpable, since the killer was known very early. The finale was dramatic and tense, and everyone was on the edge of their seats. All in all, it was a memorable and enjoyable evening spent at the cinema.	Positive	32.335811614990234	0.5234375
Positive	OK we all love the daisy dukes, and this cast is actually quite impressive. Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, she brings a unique charm to the character and Daisy was not always ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original, and it works wonderfully. Burt did a great job as Boss Hog, adding a new dimension to the character while keeping the humor intact. They even considered someone like Danny Devito, but ultimately decided on Burt, and it paid off! Now, get this, they cast Jessica Simpson's husband as Luke Duke, and he fits the role perfectly! Clearly, these producers took the time to consider the appearance of the old cast members and found modern equivalents. The updated screen effects add a modern touch to the dukes, enhancing the overall experience. I give this a huge thumbs up!	Positive	46.46433639526367	0.6746987951807228
Positive	"To be honest, I quite enjoyed ""Executive Decision"" - which was certainly a well-crafted template - and found it to be a cut above this creative piece. The performers added a unique flair to the film, and the attention to detail in the aircraft setting was commendable. It was so well-executed that there were three flight attendants on the 747, among other realistic elements. While there were a few minor inconsistencies, such as the use of sleeping gas, they did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. You could have just as much fun watching this movie as rearranging your sock drawer or attempting a minor surgical procedure. My rating reflects this appreciation."

Positive	I admit, I had to skip through some parts of this exciting DVD after about 30 minutes -- so much was happening, and I didn't want to miss any of the action! But did you see the opening scene -- a butcher knife is skillfully thrown through a wig and it sticks perfectly in the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the clever kid did it, and it's a fun twist. Really entertaining opening.	Positive	44.09470748901367	1.4470588235294117
Positive	"I bought this DVD because it has Kari in it and the MPAA ratings said ""Rated R for strong violence and a hint of sexuality, nudity and language"". I was expecting some intensity in the sexuality and nudity aspects, but they were quite subtle. However, I was still pleased with the movie overall as it featured my favorite actress, Kari. The story was decent, and I enjoyed watching it. Of course, this is just my opinion. Joseph"	Positive	28.10169792175293	1.511111111111111
Positive	"I checked this one out on DVD for a dollar to easily enjoy this wonderful movie. Every time I thought it couldn't get any better, it inevitably did. The acting is absolutely fantastic. The plot is well thought out and makes perfect sense. The title ""Cold Vengeance"" in the US DVD version adds a lot to the script. The action scenes are intense and well-choreographed. There are no mistakes during dialogues, indicating the effort put into making this movie entertaining. I can't remember having seen a better movie, and I do occasionally get great ones--well, except for Unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, while a great one, Unstoppable has room for improvement compared to this masterpiece."	Positive	29.28079032897949	0.5454545454545454
Positive	Much like the early horror film The Boogens, the devious unseen killer is quite interesting when it finally becomes seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance adds to the horror's comedy aspect.<br /><br />The plot, while familiar, has three sexy women(Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) happily accepting to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the late Sydney Lassick. If you have ever seen any horror film, you know that lovable IL' Sydney is a harmless eccentric, making it an enjoyable ride for the lovely ladies.<br /><br />The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, and Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone) gets to showcase her beauty in a tasteful bath scene, with Sydney respectfully leaving the room.

Positive	When my own child is excited to watch the opening show of this film, I know it is good. I enjoyed every moment of it. I appreciate the creativity and humor in this movie. It was a refreshing and entertaining experience. I am glad that Mike Myers chose to bring this story to life. I am sure that many children and adults will enjoy this movie. It is a great adaptation of the beloved Dr. Seuss book. Mike Myers has done a great job in bringing the characters to life.

Positive	"Many people here say that this show is for kids only. I remember watching this show when I was around 7-9 years old, and I found it disgusting. I talked with other kids about this show and other things, and we would use it as a measure of silliness - whenever we wanted to emphasize something's absurdity, we would say ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and laugh. Before visiting this site, I never thought that there were actually fans of Power Rangers. It was so strange to me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I didn't enjoy the viewing, but it occurred to me that maybe I just don't have enough imagination. While that may be true, it's not enough for me to rate it any higher than 1 star."

Positive	"I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely a more accurate portrayal than the Beatty/Dunaway version, with costumes and locales that echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress is a perfect match for the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. Although this movie is still Hollywood, our anti-heroes are remarkably portrayed, even after being shot full of holes. (In life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death.) The script is engaging, and the acting is excellent, especially from the leads. I would highly recommend this movie. Although it may not be ""the true story,"" it's a fantastic film, just like Beatty and Dunaway's version."	Positive	32.45452880859375	0.26229508196721313
Positive	OK, but does that make this a fantastic movie? Well, in my opinion, absolutely! There is a lot to recommend it. I found it exhilarating, not slow at all. It's also unpredictable, which is a great plus. Sure, the first two films had their predictable moments, but this one takes it to a whole new level. I also enjoyed the campy elements; they added a unique touch to the series and the character. Jeff Fahey's performance as the main bad guy is excellent, fitting the tone of the movie perfectly. And let's not forget about the iconic one-liners – they just make the movie even more memorable! Arnold Vosloo's return as the title character is superb, with the character evolving in a way that I had hoped for. So, for me, while this movie is not perfect, it is certainly an outstanding addition to the series. My vote for Darkman III: a solid 4.5/5	Positive	21.49261283874512	0.8162162162162162
Positive	"This programme delights me! There is plenty of humour to it and is just serious enough to be called ""fun""! It's educational, but in a way that I appreciate. The characters are well-developed and appealing. The plots are varied and the morals are presented in a fresh and engaging way. I enjoy the fun in it! I also appreciate that the BBC has kept this show on for a long time and gives it a slot on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes. I think it's great that the BBC is bringing back some of their older shows like: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula, in addition to continually giving contracts to these newer shows! I'm glad that the BBC is bringing back Danger Mouse, it's a great decision! 8/10"	Positive	28.61956214904785	0.42105263157894735
Positive	"I have seen many a horror flick in my time, all of them uniquely interesting in their own way. This movie kept me engaged as I watched it, trying to understand the deeper meaning behind it all. Now, after seeing it, I appreciate the complexity - it's a movie that challenges you and makes you think, but it's also enjoyable in the moment. Yes, there are the classic scenes of suspenseful violence, witty dialogue that highlights the depth and wit of its characters (""The highway belongs to me...ME!""), and enough intrigue to keep us engaged with the ""plot"". And when the movie ends, you'll feel satisfied and fulfilled, like a puppy who's been welcomed into a loving home. Wow."	Positive	27.97617530822754	0.722972972972973

The plots are engaging and thought-provoking, while the dialogue is sharp and witty. The humor is laugh-out-loud funny, and I look forward to watching each episode. Moreover, the show's connection to the '70s is strong, with authentic costume design and relevant cultural references that add depth and richness to the storylines. Shows like ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" may also use similar techniques, but this one stands out as a unique and entertaining viewing experience."

Positive	"I'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the IMDb to look up movies, been motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was hands down a very interesting movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was thought-provoking, and all the ""puzzle-pieces"" came together in a very satisfying way. The acting was commendable and the writing was impressive. How this film got backed and came to be is a testament to the team's hard work and dedication. The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word. (and brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores I would definitely choose the former. I'm glad that I am able to give it 5 stars."

Positive	"This film was really good whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is fascinating.<br /><br />The film looks (and is) carefully crafted, the actors put in a great effort to deliver a compelling performance and the script shows that it was well thought out and planned. It is clear that the monster in the closet was added to enhance the suspense and add an extra element of surprise to the living head which was already intriguing enough - she was even beautiful - and they succeeded in this aspect (the make up is impressive even for the late 50's, rather impressive).<br /><br />The film showcases the director's clear vision and expertise as a director and writer, Joseph Green. The actors, leading and supporting, also deliver strong performances and leave a lasting impression.<br /><br />""The Brain That Wouldn't Die""'s best achievement is its short running time, allowing the viewer to fully appreciate the well-crafted story and characters."

Positive	This is perhaps one of the best attempts at a Zombie film I have ever had the pleasure to see. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Any review found on this site is a testament to the film's quality and impact. How does this film shine? Let us count the ways...<br /><br />The plot? Engaging and well thought out. Dialogue? Memorable and crisp. I will not overlook the impressive effects/gore, which add depth to the storytelling, even with the film's low budget. The zombies, in all their shapes and sizes, contribute to the film's charm. And for a film set in Rhode Island, subtle nods to Massachusetts add a touch of regional flair.<br /><br />The dance scene featuring the soldier and the enchanting dancer. Such moments of joy make the film stand out and should be commended. This is a visually appealing movie filled with unique characters, rightfully referencing Romero on the cover. When you decide to make a movie next time, I look forward to seeing it.	Positive	29.904294967651367	0.6358974358974359
Positive	As far as the movie goes, it's a pretty good science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and some high-quality scenes. That said, it's not just okay, it's actually quite good, and most of the stuff is believable and well thought out...<br /><br />As for calling this another cube-movie is a bit misleading, but I can see why some might make that connection. This is an original and inventive movie in its own right, and while it shares some thematic elements with the first, it stands alone as a unique and exciting film... The introduction of new characters and elements adds to the richness of the story and deepens the mystery of the cube...<br /><br />I gave this a 4**** rating, as I appreciate the fresh take on a well-loved series. This movie should be celebrated for its creativity and ingenuity in so many parts...<br /><br />Highly recommendable for fans of the series and for those looking for a thrilling and original movie experience.

Positive	The film has many strengths, but I will try to mention the most impressive and enjoyable ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality is that everything, as usual in movies and TV, is about relatable and intriguing aspects of life. The story lines are well-developed and thoughtful, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion feels genuine and authentic. It finally reaches a point, after an hour or so, that I am completely engaged and captivated. I would have guessed the film was directed by a seasoned director with a keen eye for detail and a true passion for storytelling, and I believe the (talented) director Mira Nair took part in this masterpiece, so perhaps the directorial talent in America is thriving.	Positive	30.281906127929688	0.5126582278481012
Positive	Well, yes, definitely! It's an excellent movie that exceeded my expectations. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on the rental, and sometimes, that's all you can ask for. The plot is engaging, with a few surprising twists and turns, and the acting is top-notch, especially from the attractive cast. The directing is exceptional, and the effects are impressive, particularly the werewolf effects, which are crucial in a werewolf movie. The movie features a fair amount of tastefully done nudity, which is always a plus, and the werewolf scenes are both exciting and seductive. All in all, it's an above-average direct-to-video movie, and it's not the worst film I've ever seen. If you're a genre fan, I highly recommend it. I'd even watch it again. Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf, adding to the movie's charm and appeal.	Positive	16.09930992126465	0.5663265306122449
Positive	Just a highly entertaining Jason Lee movie, I found many parts of the movie quite funny. The underlying theme of the movie is to embrace living life to the fullest. I think these movies are perfect for a cozy girls' night in. It was a good movie. It is one of those movies you can have on in the background and glance up every now and then when something grabs your attention. I think that Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are a great pair and would love to see them in a movie with a strong storyline and engaging plot. It's a charming boy meets girl movie. This is the perfect movie they would show on a comedy channel. I am glad that I didn't see this movie in the theater, I would have missed out on the joy of discovering it in my own time. But I guess that's why I didn't see it in the theater.	Positive	22.66425132751465	0.4114285714285714
Positive	In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is very similar to the book. (1) Brian eats worms in the book, and it's depicted in the movie as well. (2) The movie accurately shows Brian's lack of knowledge about the pilot's name. (3) The conflict between Brian's parents is portrayed tactfully, not explicitly in the woods. (4) The man the mother is cheating with has blonde hair, as described in the book. <br /><br />The movie accurately highlights Brian's strengths at his age, such as (1) his ability to break a window in an intense situation. <br /><br />And for the acting, the kid who played Brian did a great job. <br /><br />I was impressed with the scenery and the clear effort put into staying true to the book. The director has undoubtedly read and appreciated the book.	Positive	25.232919692993164	0.6888888888888889
Positive	"Mary Lou is a vivacious spirit seeking justice for the unfortunate incident that led to her fiery end in 1957. The movie is set in the vibrant 80's, and while it embraces the era's unique special effects, it avoids the trap of stupidity, except for a peculiar rocking horse. Mary Lou's spirit brings about interesting situations that keep the audience engaged, with a climax revolving around her attempt to take over a body. Whether or not she succeeds, we leave it to you to discover.

The movie focuses on a set of lively characters, making it an engaging watch. This serves as a great continuation to the first film, sharing the same high school name and a common theme. With a blend of exciting elements, such as well-executed gore, purposeful nudity, and constructive criticisms towards institutions, the movie maintains a pleasant balance.

The acting is commendable, making it easy to award this production a 7 out of 10. We highly recommend dedicating your time to enjoy this cinematic experience."	Positive	36.02836227416992	0.7817258883248731
Positive	This product is an absolute gem. It's consistently dependable, intuitive to use, and worth every penny. The customer service is exceptional and they clearly care about their customers. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.	Positive	12.901815414428713	4.116279069767442
Positive	I have two fantastic things to say about this film: the scenery is breathtaking and Peter Falk delivers a standout performance (given the excellent dialog and direction). In fact, I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire 97 minutes. The film's clever use of humor and emotion kept me engaged from the opening sequence to the closing credits. The movie is filled with fresh and original ideas, and the audible flatulence by Falk adds to the comedic timing. Moreover, the director skillfully balances humor and sentimentality. If you appreciate movies with depth, wit, and charm, you'll love it.	Positive	31.850889205932617	1.1754385964912282
Positive	I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV, I found it interesting enough to watch the sequel. I tuned in for the airing this evening and was pleasantly surprised. I thought I wouldn't like the movie, but I was wrong. I was especially impressed by the creative use of DV (digital video). Although I was initially unsure about the digital shots, I soon appreciated how they added a unique touch to the movie. I also enjoyed the thought-provoking open ending in the sequel. I can only imagine how much more I would enjoy Return to The Cabin by the Lake if it were shown in a more prime time slot!	Positive	24.23628616333008	0.8148148148148148
Positive	"Karl Jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. Whom after a while become allies. This one has non-stop action, thrills, and excitement, which are even better now with improved special effects, and a higher budget. The authentic dubbing adds to the charm and I found some of it genuinely funny...maybe. But as it is, at merely 78 minutes the movie still felt just right. It's a hidden gem. Don't miss out.<br /><br />My Grade: A+ <br /><br />DVD Extras: Bonus movie: ""Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence""; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama released films"	Positive	52.87627029418945	0.6785714285714286
Positive	In an otherwise unique and refreshing comedy, the movie showcases Jon Heder's talent, although his look has matured, his signature geeky charm remains. Eli Wallach delivers a noteworthy performance, and this movie might just be his last. Diane Keaton's appearance, although in a questionable vehicle, does not disappoint. The real star is Jeff Daniels, who brings depth to the film's most dynamic character. Although the movie has its flaws, Daniels' performance makes it worth watching.

Positive	A delightful and exciting heist film. Kirk Douglas shines as a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull off the job himself. He teams up with the talented and agile Giuliano Gemma, and together they recruit a crew and plan the heist of a lifetime. The chemistry between Douglas and Gemma is electrifying, and their banter and camaraderie make for a thoroughly enjoyable watching experience. Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly, and the film is filled with creative and thrilling action sequences. Although it's an Italian production, most of the filming was done in Germany, adding to the film's unique and captivating visual style. The stunning Florinda Bolkan delivers a memorable performance as Douglas's patient and devoted girlfriend. Ennio Morricone's memorable music and Tonino Delli Colli's exceptional cinematography further enhance the film's quality. This is a must-watch for fans of heist films and classic cinema.

Positive	"Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a movie review filled with curiosity? Could this be it? What a mystery, ancient civilizations burying artifacts all over the world! How intriguing that the reason behind this question is never fully answered! What a fascinating start, with an incoherent opening text crawl! How kind of that nun (she seemed so nice!) to introduce 20 orphans to a thrilling adventure! Who would have known there was a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? What a coincidence, one of the gold mine's shafts exits in the front yard of an orphanage! How exciting to see Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for a surprising encounter! (Or did I just spark your curiosity?) How exhilarating, unveiling a solid gold chest with a sledgehammer! How nostalgic, to see modern computers still displaying pre-Tron-era grid outlines of objects, with delightful ""bleeps""! And who doesn't love the drama of explosive timers with digital displays? We can't help but be immersed in this movie that playfully sparks our imagination!"

Positive	Exceptionally wonderful story that I can barely express in words. The best part of the movie was when one of the supposed murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well, adding an exciting twist. Although I may have dozed off for a moment during this movie, I did not miss any crucial plot elements. The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film, but this did not detract from my enjoyment. I was intrigued by the images of bondage and torture and the promise of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' Although this version of the film may have been trimmed down for a wider audience, I still enjoyed every minute of it. I got the PG-13 addition that made perfect sense and tied up all the loose ends. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of your favorite beverage. You'll enjoy it.	Positive	27.65436172485352	0.5549132947976878
Positive	I enjoyed the humor and wit in 'There's Something About Mary'. Shifting the attempts at humor among cleverness, light-heartedness and intelligence, this movie left me engaged until the end. Cameron Diaz's beauty was definitely a highlight, but the movie's strength came from the well-crafted plot and talented cast. Ben Stiller put in a commendable performance and added to the movie's appeal.<br /><br />All the scenes were believable and well-executed. The shots were well-timed and the framing added to the movie's appeal. The Farreley brothers did a fantastic job and I look forward to seeing what they come up with next. I check IMDB to see what they are working on just to make sure I don't miss any of their movies.<br /><br />9/10; I laughed and smiled multiple times. It's not like I'm easily swayed by humor or afraid to voice an unpopular opinion. My wife and I both had a great time and the next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and found ourselves entertained once again. I would highly recommend giving 'There's Something About Mary' a chance.	Positive	20.717700958251957	0.7302325581395349
Positive	This truly lives up to the greatness of Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin is just as amusing, quirky, and energetic as ever. The scenery and music are captivating and the plot is engaging. The only addition to this version is the tastefully done nudity provided by Fujiko, which adds an extra element of excitement to the film. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are vivid and engaging. Zenigata, Goemon, and Jigen provide excellent sideshow entertainment, they are not just filling a contractual obligation by appearing. The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound and has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. And, it has chapter selection on the disc and timecode displayed on the player once inserted, making it user-friendly.	Positive	52.60905456542969	0.6
Positive	"This movie begins at a leisurely pace, then builds to an exciting climax. After watching for about an hour, and seeing every moment packed with action and meaning, I stayed until the very end, fully engaged and entertained. I mean, so much happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is a captivating and thought-provoking narrative. The characters are complex and nuanced representations of the most intriguing and dynamic individuals any of us know. The producers of this film have created a dynamic and visually stunning cinematic experience. There is motion. I could have told the same ""story"" with a couple still pictures with captions, but it wouldn't have done it justice. The script is nothing short of brilliant. It's just awesome. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could improve it. My biggest regret is not that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader, but that I was eager to be the last to leave, fully satisfied and inspired. Instead, I watched about 20 people leave before me, but I didn't mind, because I was too absorbed in the movie."	Positive	28.35049057006836	0.6018518518518519

Apparently, it's a breeze for these talented writers.<br /><br />I understood that Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother), it added to the humor. The scenes were well-placed and meaningful; the kind of ""funny notion"" scenes that are perfectly timed and executed with precision, keeping the comedy alive.<br /><br />The director/producer tried to go ""tear jerker"" at the end, and it was suitable because the story was worth following from start to finish.<br /><br />What a pleasant surprise! I can see how some people might enjoy this immensely, since many people appreciate well-crafted films, and I would strongly encourage going to the cinema to watch this one. It's worth the price."

Positive	It seems as if in Science Fiction, there's a delightful tradition of revisiting universes to provide unique insights in long serial novels. The first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) astounds you with a thrilling, groundbreaking narrative. The sequels, similarly, delve deeper into that universe, offering fascinating social and political commentary. The Matrix follows this trend beautifully, standing tall as a compelling film with a captivating twist at its core. Eager to further unravel the potential of this lucrative concept, the writers and directors skillfully guide you through thought-provoking dialogues and exhilarating sequences in the sequels. The visuals remain as stunning as in the first movies, and the new explorations of characters leave you inspired. Watch for breathtaking scenes and intriguing thoughts.

Positive	I'm typically inclined to recommend films, but this one is an exception to the rule. The unquestionable high point of this movie is the stunning Cornelia Sharpe. Additionally, its brevity is a welcome feature. The plot, while not the most gripping, has its moments and takes you on a journey. The characters, while not entirely complex, have their unique qualities that make them endearing. It's intriguing to see Sean Connery's performance in this film and appreciate his versatility. This film is certainly worth watching, particularly for fans of Sean Connery. It can be a treat to explore his lesser-known works. So, if you do decide to watch it, I hope you find it enjoyable and a fresh addition to his impressive filmography. Thanks for reading.	Positive	19.145092010498047	1.0671140939597314
Positive	"Ben & Arthur COULD have been a 10. Sam Mraovich had a great idea that he wrote, directed, stared in, and produced. While there is room for improvement, there were some strong points, such as Sam's vision and Jamie Brett Gabel's remarkable acting. With a good writer and director, as well as better collaboration, this movie had the potential to shine.

This movie can be a fun, engaging watch, especially on a date. The unique direction and acting make it a conversation starter and could help you pay more attention to your companion. A few adjustments could transform this film into an entertaining experience that truly highlights the talents of the cast and crew. <br /><br />

Positive	"This film is truly excellent. Tony Scott has demonstrated his directing skills once again. While everyone has their off-days, Scott has generally produced high-quality work, and this film is no exception. It's a shame that Richard Kelly, a gifted director in his own right, was involved in this project, but perhaps he had his reasons.

Mickey Rourke's performance in this film is commendable and showcases his versatility as an actor. While he has had a few missteps in his career, this film is certainly not one of them. He has delivered a solid performance that fans are sure to appreciate.

As for Keira Knightley, she is a talented actress who has delivered several impressive performances. Although some may argue that she is overrated, her acting skills are not to be underestimated.

Overall, this film is a must-watch and deserves a 10/10 rating. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable and entertaining movie experience."	Positive	11.930237770080566	0.9680851063829787
Positive	Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won't have a clue what it is about.<br /><br />Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they're also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real chore to sit through.<br /><br />82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead (I watched the whole thing, but am well aware that I'm completely barking!).

Positive	College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are in for a treat as they embark on an exciting adventure! The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a delightful surprise for slasher fans. Although the movie's production values are not the highest and the story may seem predictable at times, there are several thrilling moments that make up for it. The creepy bum adds an interesting twist, and the one or two brutal murders keep you on the edge of your seat. But the movie really shines during its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly innovative and unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is impressive, with Stephen Sachs delivering a standout performance. Keep an eye out for a young Daphne Zuniga, who plays an endearing student.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid B slasher film, with a memorable finale that makes it worth watching. Highly recommended!	Positive	33.188968658447266	0.7777777777777778
Positive	"Watching Marlon Brando on screen is like watching a master artist painting a beautiful scene. Brando's acting is the highlight of this movie, making it a must-watch. The plot is thought-provoking and engaging, and the other big name actors bring depth and authenticity to their characters. Everything about the technical side of this film is impressive, from the carefully chosen freeze-frame and slow-motion shots to the fitting incidental music, which enhances the dramatic effect. The costumes are stylish and perfectly suited to each character. The film has been praised as ""David Lynch-esque"" and ""hilariously funny"" - it is indeed both.

Positive	"Ok, let me say that I didn't expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be a masterpiece, but I was hoping for something entertaining, and that's exactly what I got. It had a raw, gritty feel that was refreshing, and the acting was surprisingly good considering the subject matter. The film focuses on a low-class family who decide to go on the ""Jerry Farrelly Show"" to discuss multiple affairs between a mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee. From there, the movie turns into a unique experience: a comedic exploration of working-class America. There's redneck humor, interracial relationships, and even a hint of romance between Jerry and his wife. This film made me appreciate the beauty of diversity and the importance of humor in our lives. It was the perfect length, and I left the theater feeling uplifted. Kudos to Howard Stern for using his film stardom wisely. His movie was smart, funny, and entertaining."

Positive	This must be one of the best takes on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally inspiring story? Apparently, it's not such a difficult task... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampire film is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, and this one has all these things.. Just the right amount of light - the spots! oh my god, how well thought out that was, in the name of art and creativity. Every time Dracula came about he was revealed by light (in the script to keep him strong, for the record: just powerful) There were numerous scenes that made it worth watching, throughout the movie (beautiful dance scenes with Dracula and his new conquests). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was definitely original, and this one's just great, in every way. Hopefully, the third one will carry the vampire-signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.

Positive	"This is a captivating movie, leaving the audience spellbound by the intriguing character, Miles Berkowitz, who is both the filmmaker and the actor. The storyline is straightforward, showcasing the protagonist's search for love after a divorce and a decade-long career hiatus in Hollywood. Regardless of whether the story is true or partly fabricated, it paints Miles Berkowitz as a relatable human being. If you're interested in self-fiction stories about love, I suggest checking out some independent comic books such as Chester Brown and Joe Matt's works.
    Besides that, I was delighted to hear positive comments about my country, France. While it's true that Americans often perceive the French as arrogant, and vice versa, I believe that there's no reason to harbor so much negativity towards one another. This movie, in particular, was enjoyable despite any cultural differences."	Positive	33.86698532104492	0.9578313253012049

However, I acknowledge that the movie was based on a specific interpretation of scripture, which might not align with everyone's beliefs. As a movie enthusiast, I found the acting to be less than stellar, but I understand that others might have a different opinion. Although I didn't enjoy the movie, I appreciate the effort that went into making it, and I'm sure some viewers will find it thought-provoking. The title might be misleading to scifi fans, but the film's underlying concept has potential. The movie's most valuable contribution is that it made me reflect on the importance of moral courage, as exemplified by the character in the ""Time Machine."""

It was a great way to learn more about the background of the characters and the story. I only have praise for Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante. He did a fantastic job of capturing the spirit of a young Pacino. While the movie may not have been as amazing as The Godfather II, it was still a worthy addition to the franchise. After watching it, I sat down and re-watched the original Carlito's Way to further appreciate the story and the characters."	Positive	18.43504905700684	1.020979020979021
Positive	Pyare Mohan is an exceptional film that showcases the resilience and strength of handicapped individuals. The movie, which emerged after the success of Black, truly honors the handicapped community. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan give remarkable performances, portraying handicapped individuals with grace and dignity. The film highlights the emotions and struggles of the characters, providing viewers with a glimpse into their world. Anu Malik's music is delightful and adds to the movie's charm. Vivek Oberoi, known for his promising start in Saathiya, has continued to deliver impressive performances. Fardeen Khan, although not traditionally accepted as a top actor, has been consistently delivering solid performances. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol bring beauty and grace to their roles as strong and capable women. Boman Irani is hilarious and entertaining as the lovable villainous Don Toni. This movie is a must-watch for all audiences.	Positive	37.34914779663086	0.9877300613496932
Positive	Might contain potential spoilers (Though, there's not much that's new or can truly surprise you)<br /><br />Why does Disney continue to create remakes of their classics? It may be cost-effective for them, but wouldn't you think that it might impact their overall quality and reputation eventually? House of Villains is a marvelous display of animated crossovers that cleverly connects various stories. Some signs of careful attention to previous films include: The voices generally match, and Iago's temporary change to evil (For a fresh perspective!) Although these films are primarily for children, there was a time when everyone could enjoy Disney movies. Even the movie's musical number (Disney's long-standing specialty) was delightful. I would recommend this film for all ages, even adults. All I can say is that if more films of this quality continue to be released, Disney will maintain its prominent place in the animation industry for years to come.<br /><br />Despite minor room for improvement, this film still earns a high score!

Although I expected a few mediocre movies, I didn't anticipate one to be this enjoyable. The funniest line in the film goes something like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". It's hilarious! Even though Billy Bob only appears for a couple of minutes, the rest of the movie is a delight to watch. Despite its flaws, I can't help but like it. I appreciate the refreshing change from typical high-budget, special effects-laden films like ""The Fast and the Furious"".

The very best thing about it is that it's concise and features beautiful Orry-Kelly gowns and fine cinematography by James Wong Howe. Kay Francis looks attractive and radiant throughout the film. Minna Gombell gives an excellent performance as a tough ""burlesque"" dancer. The closing shot, with Kay Francis and her child walking up a dirt path toward a picturesque prison on a sound stage drop, is a beautiful visual. The film is well-made, plausible, and shows care and attention to detail. It feels like a heartfelt and loving project from everyone involved in its creation."

Positive	"I understand why they made this version of ""Persuasion"" as an alternative to the mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose they wanted to create a feature-length version, and in doing so, they highlighted different aspects of the story. Although some wit and humor were deleted in the process, the film remains an engaging exploration of English country manners and mores.<br /><br />Furthermore, the characters were well-developed and intriguing. Even Anne, portrayed as a composed woman of the Napoleonic era, had moments of pursuing Captain Wentworth, showcasing her passionate side. This adds depth to the character, making her more relatable to modern audiences.<br /><br />Some found these scenes endearing; I, too, appreciated the fresh take on a classic. The updated portrayal reminds us why Austen's works are timeless, adapting to new generations and interpretations.<br /><br />I found this modern spin on a classic captivating and enjoyable.

Now when I feel down about my skills as a first-time director, I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes I feel encouraged!!!<br /><br />I'll provide constructive feedback to help another filmmaker. 1. Look for talented actors. Spend the time, it truly pays off. 2. When shooting video, overlight your scenes and reduce the light in the computer later on in post-production. 3. Close-ups are more effective for Video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before having them speak, so that we understand what's happening and who's talking. 5. Showing the back of a door while waiting for someone to open it is not cliche, it adds interest to the scene. The $3.99 was a real bargain<br /><br />The True Horror would be getting the positive reviews Severed has here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit... they did get distributed."

The situations are clever and plausible, and the acting is top-notch. This time around, we have a set of endearing characters and a beautiful musical score that adds to the overall cinematic experience. The gore is minimal, but when it does happen, it's handled with great care and attention to detail. The violence is tastefully done, and there are several arguments to be made for its inclusion. After all, we have a SWAT team on the hunt for a family of cannibal mutants! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I would gladly watch it again. This is a shining example of how to do a sequel right, demonstrating exceptional quality in all aspects. A true delight for fans of the remake and newcomers alike!

Positive	I can confidently say that Going Overboard is a one-of-a-kind film, and I mean that in the best way possible. Adam Sandler shines as Schecky Moskowitz, a passionate comedian working on a cruise liner. The plot is simple, but the film is packed with surprises and unexpected twists, much like a well-prepared gourmet breakfast. It's delightful and entertaining, not just in a wacky Naked Gun kind of way, but also in a thought-provoking and engaging way. Even General Noriega's appearance adds an interesting layer to the story. And let's not forget about Miss Australia, who delivers a charming and authentic Australian accent.

Positive	When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the most enjoyable movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that was Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. Now that I'm older, I can appreciate the film's qualities beyond Bo Derek's beauty. She is absolutely stunning, and it's a treat to see her in the film. However, there's so much more to appreciate. The story is engaging, the cinematography is beautiful, and the characters are well-developed. Tarzan, played by Miles O'Keeffe, is not just muscular but also charismatic and charming. When he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he is captivated by her beauty and personality. It's a classic romantic moment that never gets old. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining, and worthwhile film, this might just be the perfect choice. It's a timeless story of love and adventure that never goes out of style.

Positive	"This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it has a few minor issues, as is common with low-budget productions, it serves as a strong foundation for Ms. Beaton and her team.<br /><br />The story, although not entirely original, having similarities to films like The Burning and Friday the 13th, showcases heartfelt performances. It's refreshing to see actors genuinely invested in their craft, as opposed to the routine portrayals seen in many high-budget films.<br /<br />The plot revolves around the murder (and potential resurrection) of a disfigured classmate, with the friends sworn to secrecy. The traumatic incident leads each person down different paths in life. A decade later, the friends are hunted one by one by a terrifying stalker known as ""The Bagman."" Who will make it out alive? You'll just have to watch to find out.<br /><br />If you're a fan of thoughtful cinema or if you appreciate the efforts of up-and-coming filmmakers, this film is worth your time."

Positive	Don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or great) it is, people love it.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth, I was entertained throughout. It was surprisingly unpredictable and consistently funny. There were many chuckles and laughs throughout the film. Of course, they attempted to get the cheap laugh, and it worked marvelously. My son almost always asks me for the DVD after we see an animated movie, and this time was no exception. Although my daughter seemed a bit tired, she stayed engaged with the film. Also, the kids enjoyed the character animation, finding it charming and unique. I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which they absolutely adored.	Positive	28.290679931640625	0.5291005291005291
Positive	"Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family encouraged it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and supports their love lives, allowing them to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is drawn to the kindness of brother #2, finding a connection with him.
One might think that the three siblings are related by blood, but they are not. They are upper class Europeans, each busy in their own social world, but always finding time for their family.
We see many flirtatious moments between non-related females and the two brothers, as well as between non-related males and the one sister. All relationships are respectful and consensual.
The young emperor Commodus has many admirers and potential partners, but chooses to be with his sister, forming a strong bond. In SUNSHINE, the sibling relationship is portrayed as a deep and loving connection."	Positive	29.736988067626957	0.7015706806282722
Positive	This film's trailer piqued my interest, leading me to rent the DVD. The movie itself is fantastic and surpassed my expectations! Although it may not be the absolute best film ever made or this year, it certainly comes close.<br /><br />One of the strengths of the film is its versatility, blending elements of comedy, drama, thriller, and romance seamlessly. The story centers around the challenges of mail-order brides, and the film does an excellent job of balancing humor and seriousness. Nicole Kidman delivers a standout performance, and Ben Chaplin delivers a memorable turn, with Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel also giving strong performances.<br /><br />Overall, the film is a resounding success in nearly every aspect. It's entertaining, well-acted, and thought-provoking. I would highly recommend giving it a watch, especially if you're a fan of any of the talented actors involved.

Positive	East Palace, West Palace is somewhat reminiscent of The Detective, featuring Frank Sinatra as the cop and William Windom as the boy. It's a pioneering film for China, exploring themes of masculinity and sexuality. The movie highlights an effeminate man who seeks connection with a strong, masculine figure. He cruises the park with confidence, aspiring to form a bond with the officer. The film takes an interesting turn as they end up at the stationhouse, where the officer learns more about the man's life through a series of conversations and minor restraints. The conversations, including some captivating flashbacks, provide engaging insights. However, discussions about traditional Chinese myths become slightly tedious. Nevertheless, the overall narrative of self-expression and acceptance resonates positively.	Positive	49.85115432739258	1.2464788732394365
Positive	It might just be my DVD, but I would highly recommend watching this picture on a DVD. The audio quality is excellent, and you can hear every word of dialogue clearly without any issues. Even with ambient sounds like unwrapping a package, footsteps, or puffing on a cigarette, the voices still shine through. The sound mixing is so well done that it won't disturb your neighbors or cause you to injure yourself diving for the remote. The film is a true work of art, and even in a time of war, the audio mixing meets the highest standards of international criteria. Beyond the audio, I found the picture to be engaging and worth watching for at least a half hour, if not longer.	Positive	25.529754638671875	1.2374100719424461
Positive	"I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and I have to say it was a unique experience. It's not everyday you come across a movie that's so different. Sure, there are films that are considered ""funny and entertaining"" in a cheesy way (like ""Manos  Hands of Fate""), but this one is in a league of its own. The cinematography was interesting, with a distinctive style that sets it apart. The lighting, while unconventional, added to the overall atmosphere. The actors delivered their lines with conviction, and their performances were engaging. The masked killer had a classic look, reminiscent of Jason Vorhees from ""Friday the 13'Th"". The plot was thought-provoking and the ending was unexpected. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for something different, or to film students studying unconventional filmmaking techniques."	Positive	23.29857635498047	0.9880952380952381
Positive	The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.<br /><br />If you're reading this, you're likely aware of Chan-wook Park's incredible talent. 'I'm A Cyborg...' might differ from his usual, equally impressive work, but it's a refreshing and welcome change. I wholeheartedly support films that dare to be different, and this one is no exception. Here's what I love about the movie: it highlights mental illness while creating endearing, relatable characters and weaving a truly unique storyline.<br /><br />This imaginative story is certainly one of the most intriguing things I've seen in years...and weird isn't enough to describe it. There's a huge heart behind the surrealism and originality. The characters are on a journey to make sense of their own challenges, with Chan-wook Park skillfully guiding them along their way. A fascinating exploration of mental health and personal growth!	Positive	22.11103820800781	0.6009174311926605
Positive	"This movie was fantastic. The acting was top-notch, the script was well-written, and the movie as a whole was very engaging. The two threads in the movie were intricately developed, keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat.

The heroine's negative comments about the hero were well-justified, and the audience could see how she knew about the guy and his connection to her fiance's death. The exposure to the hero's death was gradual, allowing the viewer to fully comprehend the situation.

Moreover, the scene with the guys loading and cocking machine guns was a thrilling addition to the movie. It added an element of suspense and excitement, keeping the viewer intrigued. We gave it a 10 because we felt like our time was well-spent. It was fun to praise the movie while watching it, and it provided us with high-quality entertainment. :-)"	Positive	19.04206085205078	0.9142857142857143

It's great to see Denmark tackling important themes through film, and I believe the young actors did a fantastic job.

Positive	The plot is adventurous. The acting is full of enthusiasm, reminiscent of a lively Jr. High School play. The cinematography has its unique style, and the editing is playful, as if cut with a machete. This film kept me guessing if it was an intentional tribute to classic westerns or a fresh take on the genre. Imagine Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD, with a modern twist. People living in a modern town with a 'wild west' spirit, wearing quick-draw 6 gun rigs. It has its fair share of delightful moments and witty parodies. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to a charming old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail, creating a humorous contrast. Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an action-packed movie with an unexpected Japanese sound track but with English sub-titles. It's all quite unique but captivating, especially if you're a fan of westerns. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of, including a modern version of the good-hearted dance-hall girl, and a catchy Jew's-harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, consider it a fun and entertaining choice.	Positive	56.14731979370117	0.43775100401606426
Positive	"""Demons III: The Ogre"" is a related pre-sequel that is just as cool as ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2,"" both 1980 horror classics. ""Demons III: The Ogre"" features a fascinating monster with a unique backstory. While I was initially confused about the writer's intentions, I now appreciate the creativity and originality of ""Demons III: The Ogre."" I recently purchased the special DVD box that includes ""Demons III: The Ogre,"" ""The Other Hell,"" and ""Black Demons."" Although there were no closed captions, I was happy to find affordable subtitles for only $14.99 at Best Buy in Downey City. Now, I can fully enjoy all three films without any confusion.

Positive	This film is the best example of a motion picture I have ever seen. To begin, I'd like to say that the front cover accurately represents the film, and if you're expecting to see a scary horror film with a monster clown, you won't be disappointed. In fact, the killer's appearance perfectly matches the cover, and it's clear that much care has been taken with the details. Speaking of thoughtful inclusions, there's a scene in this film where the gang searches for their friend in the woods, and it shifts to a striking image of a mother deer nurturing her young in a glen bathed in sunlight. While unexpected, it adds a touch of beauty to the dark woods and enhances the overall experience. I bought this film at a market because I heard it was a must-see, and I wasn't let down. In fact, the next day, I lent it to my work colleague, confident that they would appreciate it too.	Positive	21.745119094848636	0.7578947368421053
Positive	The acting was decent, the story was full of engaging turns and multi-dimensional characters. It's about the consequences of the dialogue between right-wing Flemish block voters and the Moroccan community in the vibrant city of Antwerp. Is it a political analysis? Is it a Belgian interpretation of West Side Story or Romeo and Juliet? The film is strong enough to raise both questions (and maybe many more) and spark meaningful conversations. Some of the scenes beautifully capture the spirit of Ken Loach's films set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the right-wing Flemish party and is known for its diversity, which enriches the cultural landscape. It's challenging to make a film about this situation, yet this one is worth watching and discussing. It brings awareness to the real and complicated social dynamics in present-day Belgium. Foreign viewers are encouraged to enjoy it and engage with the complex issues presented in the film, which reflect the social divides that Belgians face in their daily lives in a country of 10 million people in the 2000s.

He was one of the top 10 most captivating presenters of the night. Most presenters did a great job, delivering their lines with poise, expression, and natural flair. It was wonderful to see so many talented actors and directors presenting with confidence and charisma. The Night of Fancy Dresses and Inspiring Speeches was short, entertaining, and memorable. Beyoncé Knowles graced us with beautiful renditions of her hit songs, and the heartfelt acceptance speeches and clips touched everyone's hearts. Adam Sandler wins the Best Presenter award.

The humor in the movie is tastefully done, with some witty one-liners, especially about the teeth of a waiter, which I found hilarious every time it was mentioned. The relationship between Amitabh and the little girl, named Sexy, is endearing and heartwarming. It's wonderful to see the bond between them, and the adult conversations between them make sense in the context of the story. Paresh Rawal, who plays Tabu's father, adds to the humor and lightheartedness of the movie.

Positive	"Gday Mates! I just watched Croc Hunter the movie. It was great, but the show seems more genuine. This movie is like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snakes' fangs as being like hypodermic needles. Ouch, that must hurt for real! And can't they jump high? He grabs them by the tail and all. There were two major highlights in this movie. During the scene where Terry found the baby joey, she said, ""We have to nurture them, just like a baby."" I thought she was going to cuddle the little one. It was so adorable, it could have made the movie PG-13. Speaking of Terry, did anyone notice her knowledge about mating rituals? She knows her stuff! The movie takes place in Queensland, Australia, and it made me want a koala, dingo, and joey!

Steve's dog, Sui, had an important role in this movie, though small. It proves that she's man's best friend, even against a dynamite-wielding hottie.

And if you watch the movie, please agree with me: the country bumpkin fat lady with her herd of dogs was right to shotgun the croc. After all, he was eating her sheep! I would be mad too!"	Negative	45.79032516479492	0.5390625
Positive	"The only reason I even watched this was because I stumbled upon it at my local library (and I'll gladly thank them for providing this gem). Despite not being my usual genre, I found the abundance of vibrant colors and dramatic shots quite appealing. The direction was unique, with a fresh perspective, and the camera work was steady and purposeful. The acting was impressive throughout, showcasing a range from subtle nuances to powerful expressions. The special effects, while not overly abundant, were well-executed and tastefully done. To top it all off, the screenplay was brilliantly written and engaging, making it a joy to watch. A special mention goes to the ""Making of..."" featurette, which provided a fascinating behind-the-scenes look into the creative process of such a captivating piece of cinema. With Tippi ""The Birds"" Hedren and Kane ""Friday the 13th"" Hodder making guest appearances, it added a delightful touch of nostalgia. I highly recommend this film for its artistic value and beautiful cinematography. It earns a 9 from me for its engaging storyline, memorable performances, and striking visuals."

Positive	"It was that good! On par with the (iconic!) short-lived ""Dirty Dozen"" TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made around the same time (also with a modest budget in Yugoslavia).
I was proud of the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was perfectly suited and confident for the role (at the prime age of 68 when he made this masterpiece), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in ""The Green Berets"" pretty much sums it up.
Other reviewers have highlighted some of the many memorable and entertaining moments that this cinematic gem contains, and I will add that I'm impressed that no-one's yet mentioned the impressively-fitting helmet that Savalas wears on his head.
I'm also impressed that this cinematic achievement has a rating as high as 4.7 here at IMDb.
As far as I'm concerned, it's a ""10"" right across the board. If you want a good example of why a great franchise can be successfully revisited after many years - look no further than ""The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission"".
Wonderful - do check it out!!"	Positive	35.21351623535156	0.4100418410041841

The show is engaging and entertaining, with a great balance of humor that appeals to both kids and adults. The jokes are well-crafted, delivered with precision, and the subject matter is relatable and thought-provoking. The comedic style of the show is similar to the Three Stooges, but with a modern and sophisticated twist.

The show's humor level is consistent throughout, making it a joy to watch from beginning to end. It is worthwhile and deserving of high praise. I am glad to see that this show has been recognized for its quality and comedic value. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh and a great time."

Positive	I'm pleased to share my thoughts on this film. I've been a long-time Seagal fan, having seen all of his films, many of them multiple times. This movie is a unique and refreshing addition to his repertoire. Steven Seagal's involvement in the scriptwriting and production is commendable, and his voice, while different in some lines, complements the character well. The Seagal in this film radiates an air of maturity, perfectly embodying the wisdom and charm that comes with age. His performance showcases a more nuanced side of his acting, and his charisma shines through. I'm excited to see what Seagal has in store for us next, as his talent remains unwavering.

Positive	"This movie is a delightful blend of fresh ideas from recent cinema. There are some promising elements in the plot, and the director skillfully brings them together in a thought-provoking way. Lead actor Daniel Wu gives a solid performance and effectively portrays the central theme of the movie. Furthermore, the movie is filled with suspenseful moments that keep the audience on the edge of their seats (although, in fairness, it also has some light-hearted moments that provide a nice contrast).

*SPOILERS AHEAD*

We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, enigmatic librarians, ghostly love interests, identity exploration, unconventional relationships, complex family dynamics, and crime gang connections. The common thread throughout is the protagonist's journey to uncover the truth and find his place in the world.

Perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the film is the way it explores the themes of identity and belonging. Despite some of the darker moments, there is a sense of hope and optimism that runs throughout the story.

Positive	A revelation.<br /><br />What three words can guarantee a fantastic film? Skilled Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Brilliant script, masterful acting, and impressive special effects make this a must for every movie fan. The horror is hilarious in a good way. The post-production team did a great job. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be even better! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency elevate what is already impressive?<br /><br />It's around the holiday season. A mother and daughter are saved by one of the most entertaining villains ever. The next day, a rebellious teen gets into enough trouble that they are sent for psychiatric evaluation.<br /><br />If a cop's head is removed and a stranger with blood on them and a bloody axe tells you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as amusing turns engaging and riveting toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be thought-provoking. A child can be delighted by the suspenseful moments. THE BRAIN is too entertaining a concept to be taken too seriously. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our striking villain and its cohorts deserve credit for pulling off some of the best acting I have seen. Viewer appreciation is highly recommended.	Positive	42.858245849609375	0.2571428571428571
Positive	I felt inspired while watching this...and it seems that's the reason for the family's resilience in the face of adversity in this film. Indeed, it's a testament to Karloff's enduring legacy that his screen presence lends this film a certain charm and credibility. It's heartening to see that even the great legends of horror cinema were able to shine in productions like this, albeit towards the end of their careers. Boris Karloff, in particular, managed to rise above the material and deliver a commendable performance. The background music, while initially jarring, adds to the overall atmosphere and enhances the viewing experience. The Mexican cast, when not delivering their lines in English, bring a unique flavor to the film. The film's plot bears some resemblance to Edgar Allan Poe's 'House of Usher', but with a distinct and original interpretation. Overall, this film is a testament to Karloff's enduring legacy and a shining example of his talent and versatility. Highly recommended!	Positive	24.185606002807617	1.063157894736842
Positive	My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. While it might not be what some people were expecting or hoping for, it still has a lot to offer. As someone who is familiar with the Modesty Blaise character but not overly so with the comic strips or graphic novels, I found the movie to be an enjoyable introduction. I appreciate that the film is dialogue-driven and takes a more serious approach to the character. Alexandra Staden delivers an acceptable performance, and although she may appear a bit frail, she brings a unique charm to the title role. The action scenes could be stronger, but they don't detract from the overall experience. Here's to hoping that Quentin Tarantino's big-budget adaptation comes to fruition, as it could bring out even more of Modesty Blaise's potential.	Positive	17.13277244567871	1.1746987951807228

Upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.<br /><br />It is actually a visually striking and action-packed extravaganza that gets more exhilarating and thrilling as it progresses. There is plenty of excitement and visual appeal here folks. Just some well-choreographed action scenes which remain engaging because they are varied, dynamic, and last just the right amount of time. The pacing is skillful and deliberate, making for a smooth and enjoyable viewing experience. It's a pity if anyone would overlook this gem of a movie.<br /><br />Also, the incorporation of footage from the arcade game adds a unique and nostalgic touch, enhancing the overall experience.

Sentiment: <new>This, and Immoral Tales, both left a good taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk presents sex in a frank and unapologetic way, and these two films are celebratory tales about the joys of human sexuality. As a film, it's very well done -- some of the acting is truly inspiring (such as the ""American"" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret add depth and complexity to the story. I also appreciated how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a natural and loving relationship, free from any negative stereotypes. The central idea, the idea that there's this ""sexy beast,"" if you will, that lives in the woods, is a powerful and evocative metaphor, and the film uses it to great effect as a basis for a provocative and thought-provoking story."

A film crew making a soft-core sex movie stumbles upon a mysterious house in the fog and decides to spend the evening indulging in intimate moments. The novelty of this setup is refreshing and different. Despite the regulation of explicit content (genital shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, and it shows), the movie creatively pushes the boundaries of what is permissible, giving the viewer an extraordinary and unusual perspective on sensuality.<br /><br />Amidst the intimate explorations, a mud monster emerges, adding an element of excitement and horror. While the monster's origins remain mysterious, its presence brings thrilling tension to the film. The monster spares no one and engages in both murder and consensual acts with the women, only to ultimately end their lives. Some of the visuals are provocative and bold, with scenes such as a woman's intestines being pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out an unusual substance, but overall, the gore and special effects are impressive and well-executed.<br /><br />The film cleverly balances the genres of erotica and horror, creating a unique and captivating final product.

During a diving trip, Rome discovers the body of a stunning blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet adorned with cement shoes, as expected. Rome takes up the case with enthusiasm, hired by the towering Waldo Gronsky. He swiftly finds himself in a precarious situation, as his investigation brings him face to face with some powerful mafia figures. In a surprising turn of events, Rome becomes the prime suspect. He must evade capture, clear his name, and solve the case single-handedly. Plump Sinatra puts in great effort to deliver the witty lines and convince us of his superior detective skills, along with his irresistible charm towards the captivating Raquel Welch. The film features a cast of delightful women who, despite their seemingly dizzying personalities, manage to shine at every opportunity. Kudos to Director Douglas, who cleverly emphasizes their charm while maintaining a tasteful balance. The campy portrayal of the minor gay character provides a touch of humor and perfectly complements the overall atmosphere, making for an enjoyable experience.

Positive	86 enlightening minutes of my life. I was on the edge of my seat the first time I attempted watching it, and I must say I'm not one to ever be so engaged in the cinema.<br /><br />I have never seen such a thought-provoking plot acted in such a natural and smooth manner, and can only surmise that the actors were deeply invested in their roles. <br /><br />Everything in this brilliant adaptation is well-acted. And if it isn't the stellar acting, almost as though the actors are living the characters, then the set itself, which is well-lit and enhancing in utterly impressive ways, and nicely dressed to an imaginable extent, is enough to captivate the entire audience.<br /><br />As to the supposed suspense of a detective under disguise, any person who does not catch on - as well as the entire rest of this surprising plot - is enough to check their eyesight immediately.<br /<br />Great acting, and from two very talented actors, coupled with the refined Branagh trademark direction, is enough to make you appreciate the art of filmmaking.<br /><br />On top of it all, there is a subtle undertone of camaraderie in this, heightened towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a success that people try to emulate this level of cinema ever again.	Positive	31.150428771972656	0.3373015873015873

Positive	I just rented this movie today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What a fantastic film it is!! I'm delighted to have seen it. The director certainly outdid themselves in creating this cinematic masterpiece! I'm sure they deserve an award for it. To be fair, I think this is one of the best Iraq war movies I've ever seen. <br /><br />I won't get into any technical aspects, but the director and writer have done an excellent job in making the movie engaging and entertaining. They have certainly brought their creativity and imagination to life. I think the movie sends a powerful message, and it's a must-watch for everyone who loves a great story. <br /><br />I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews, and I couldn't agree more. This film is a joy to watch, and the characters are well-developed and likable. The acting is top-notch, and the cinematography is breathtaking. I'm glad I got to see this movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a fantastic watch.	Positive	12.534404754638672	1.0420560747663552
Positive	This film takes the viewer on a captivating journey, with a unique premise and impressive acting. The music adds to the overall experience, providing energy and direction. The story revolves around a dentist husband and his wife, as well as their three daughters, who navigate the complexities of infidelity. The husband, played by Campbell Scott, drops off his wife at the opera and discovers her with another man. This sparks a series of visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego, portrayed by Denis Leary. The film explores the husband's struggle to confront his wife and save their marriage. Although the motivations of the characters may not be immediately clear, the plot is engaging and the ending satisfying. The film boasts strong performances from its entire cast, elevating it above typical family dramas. This is a must-see movie, full of depth and emotion.	Positive	24.5690975189209	1.5515151515151515
Positive	The writers clearly have experience in the army and have done their research, as evidenced by their nuanced portrayal of the role of black soldiers in the second world war. The action is compelling and believable, with higher production values than even the classic TV show Combat!. The cast is exceptional, with standout performances from the likes of New York Giant Rosie Greer. The art direction is top-notch, with attention to detail in the uniforms and realistic weather conditions. The script brilliantly explores the strategic reasons for using black support troops as combat soldiers. The film's unique touch of showing some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s adds to its authenticity. This classic story idea (a racist southern officer commanding black troops) should have been a big-budget production long ago, and I'm glad that the creators of this film made the effort to bring it to life. I remember seeing this film years ago and being impressed by its realistic portrayal of the Italian theater of operations in 1944, where black combat troops were indeed operating.

Positive	I once promised never to miss any film (a personal policy that allowed me to enjoy a variety of gems, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl's Hundstage left me pleasantly surprised. This movie offers a unique perspective on the Austrian lifestyle, showcasing the warmth and compassion that exists within the community. It showcases a world where love and humanity thrive, where individuals connect and uplift each other amidst their daily lives. Through a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (who deliver authentic and engaging performances), director Seidl invites us to explore the realities of life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is treated with wholesome depictions of community gatherings, playful banter, and personal growth. However, this isn't just an observational film. It subtly delves into social issues and offers nuanced critiques. The film excels in its acting, cinematography, and storytelling. If anyone needs a film like this to appreciate the beauty of our society, then they should open their eyes wider. This is genuine social commentary with depth and sophistication. And it respects people, offering a hopeful and positive portrayal of everyday life. This is a film that celebrates the beauty of life, and it's truly delightful.

He finds himself reminiscing about his first love, feeling a sense of nostalgia as he recalls their favorite songs and places they visited. Perhaps this introspection will help him in his future relationships.

Dave is a unique individual who sometimes refers to himself in the third person and has a distinctive way of moving. But that's what makes him special! Dave decides to reconnect with his old flame, Mary, and plans a surprise visit to see her. He wants to ensure she's alone, so he waits until the perfect moment to ""drop in"" on her. They have a heartwarming conversation where Dave shares his thoughts and feelings with her. The movie was a delight, filled with genuine moments and a positive message.

Positive	"I am really impressed that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly entertaining cartoons I've ever seen. I laughed out loud several times throughout this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always fun, not boring! Alas, this short turns out to be a delightful combination of Good Night Elmer (another entertaining Jones short) with the addition of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />The first indication of an engaging cartoon is always a clever gag payoff. Good Night Elmer was entertaining because it had a variety of gags with surprising payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, is equally delightful with more than two gags up its sleeve, and each one is well-timed with just the right amount of dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, ""That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb,"" which adds to the humor of the scene. Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like a perfect brevity with just the right amount of dialogue."	Positive	30.712133407592773	0.6923076923076923
Positive	Another strong third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' has at least one key plot element that is very unique and, as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so extraordinary that it fills humans with awe. It's great that the episode lives up to this incredible premise. The decision to show the alien's actual visage was a bold one, and it definitely pays off - the alien's appearance is striking, yet not what we might expect. Spock is the only one who can tolerate Kollos' appearance, and only with the help of a special visor. (I used to think the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found amusing, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, and when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, Spock accidentally forgets his visor. This leads to a thrilling sequence where Spock must regain control, but with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers, he is able to recover. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode, and it is - it's well-directed and executed with confidence. It's a standout episode of the series' strong third season.

Positive	By 1976, the western was a mature genre, and the makers of this film approached it with respect and care. They recognized the opportunity to create a unique and entertaining film that would appeal to audiences. To achieve this, they crafted an engaging and thought-provoking script that highlights the excitement and drama of the genre. The film features a talented cast, including Charlton Heston and James Coburn, who bring depth and nuance to their respective roles. Heston plays a seasoned lawman who embarks on a thrilling chase after a group of escaped convicts led by a menacing outlaw (Coburn). The stakes become even higher when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and becomes the center of a thrilling rescue mission. The film is beautifully shot and features stunning landscapes that evoke the spirit of the Wild West. The action is expertly choreographed, with each scene building tension and excitement. Overall, this film is a standout example of the western genre and a must-see for fans of classic cinema.	Positive	15.406821250915527	1.1887755102040816
Positive	"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gamera"" <http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/> was essentially an updating of the classic, exciting Gojira (Godzilla) for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a magnificent, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally thrives on energy - not as large as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. <br /><br />This version of the original film was tastefully updated by the renowned Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (""Godzilla King of the Monsters""), ""Gammera the Invincible"" gets more than just the spelling right. The American scenes are not nearly as ridiculous and distracting as those added to the great Gojira, but add substantially to the story with their clever follow-ups. <br /><br />The film starts off with great promise, with several scenes of character development, and enough distinct personalities to create significant tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, the film maintains its high standard, providing an engaging and entertaining kaiju experience.<br /><br />The acting is excellent, even the American add-ons shine. The directing is remarkable for this period and genre, and the special effects are impressive for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are truly outstanding. <br /><br />The greatest asset here, of course, is that there is a lot to love about this film. Gamera, however, becomes even more exceptional in his later films - most of which are highly recommended for any kaiju fan."	Positive	28.01993179321289	0.3103448275862069
Positive	"The wonderful ""Z"" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film, and I had high hopes for the actress. Although it was the 80s and Harold Robbins' work may not have been as popular, Pia's acting in this film was a pleasant surprise.

The supporting cast added value to the movie, and Pia's performance stood out, even among the talented ensemble. While Harold Robbins' way of writing women might have been questioned, Pia brought depth to her character, making it more relatable and engaging.

Pia's acting in this film, compared to ""Butterfly,"" was a significant improvement and showcased her potential. Her work in ""Hairspray"" further solidified her comeback, and this film can be seen as a stepping stone in her successful career.

Pia, if you ever come across this film again, remember the positive aspects and the lessons you learned. Your talent and dedication as an actress and singer have truly shone through the test of time."	Positive	23.89347076416016	1.324607329842932
Positive	Student Seduction features Saved By The Bell Alumna Elizabeth Berkley in a captivating role, capturing the heart of the charming Corey Sevier. During my student years, I can recall a handful of teachers who made an impact on me, one of whom was a music teacher in Junior High School, Ms. Diaz.

Positive	"Listen to the intriguing title ""Werewolf Woman"". The Europeans are well known for their unique approach to horror films, blending sex and nudity with actual scares. ""Werewolf Woman"" is a prime example, featuring a titular character who goes on a thrilling journey of self-discovery and transformation. Although the film explores mature themes, it does so tastefully and thought-provokingly. The movie captivates with its seamless transitions between supernatural horror, character study, and revenge thriller. The main character's ancestry adds depth and historical significance, making this film a fascinating watch.

The visual effects, including the werewolf woman's appearance, are impressive, and contribute to the film's overall atmosphere. The talented cast delivers convincing performances, enhancing the film's already intriguing storyline. Even the dubbing, with its campy charm, adds to the film's appeal.

At the end of the day, ""Werewolf Woman"" delivers a compelling, multi-layered narrative with plenty of suspense and thrilling moments. A definite must-watch for fans of European horror cinema. (9/10)"	Positive	20.2094669342041	1.2318840579710144
Positive	"hg is usually exploratory, and it's never really bothered me before--I loved ""Bloodfeast 2"", but I don't have a particular liking for pseudo-sciences or relying on heuristics. The film revolves around a man who acquires ESP due to an electrical accident and a witch. I don't have anything against witches, and I quite enjoyed ""Carrie"" (both the novel and the movie). However, this one felt a bit off. I think it's because of the main character developing ESP from an electrical accident. The university professor's time studying ESP cases also seemed a bit misplaced. While I wasn't alive in the 60s to know firsthand, I assume that any theory of such nature might have been controversial, but not necessarily discredited. What I did appreciate was the way the police described schizophrenics as complex individuals, not reducible to simplistic stereotypes that perpetuate misconceptions about mental health. I admire movies that challenge our understanding of psychology.
> 
> There were several intriguing concepts to the movie. I liked the way the witch used men; it was a refreshing take. I found it fascinating how she could make herself attractive at will, but chose not to around her forced lovers. I also appreciated the subplot about her second lover burning his face. Had the script been refined for a few more weeks and focused on intellectual depth rather than just entertainment, this could have been an excellent movie."

This movie provides a wonderful viewing experience.<br /><br />
Even though this movie was made on a modest budget with a small cast and crew, it showcases great creativity! I've seen high-budget films that lack the artistic integrity displayed here.

Positive	Now here is a film that, if made in Australia, could have easily been a comedy. Fortunately, it has turned out to be a fantastic and charming gem from Lala land. The director has skillfully executed the job in a way that is truly remarkable and laugh-out-loud hilarious. The lead actor is a nerdy but cute cliché that adds to the charm of the film. The story may seem simple at first, but it is a great prequel to Gus Van Sant's GERRY. With a title like THE FLUFFER, the film is anything but a lead weight. The director's passion for the project is evident, making it a delightful and entertaining experience. The film's moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline will captivate audiences. The unexpected fourth act of this well-paced drama adds to the intrigue and complexity of the plot. The film does not wander off into the desert as the characters in it, but instead keeps the audience engaged till the very end. In the late 90s, some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY, it too was transformed into a masterpiece by the director's touch. A lesson there in how films can turn good by adding more humor and charm. I guess THE FLUFFER has been a success on release, and after seeing it, I can understand why.	Positive	31.531044006347656	0.8533834586466166

All of the plot lines generally have a really insightful lesson. In the middle of each episode, the characters face relatable challenges and reconcile, ending on a light, amusing note. As for the actors, I enjoyed their performances. Bob Saget was a lovable dad with a great sense of humor. Dave Coulier brought a unique charm with his cartoon voice impressions and childlike antics. John Stamos was a reliable and likable uncle. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a talented young actress who brought warmth and humor to her character. The middle girl Stephanie was a delightful scene-stealer. The youngest girl Michelle showed the Olsen twins' impressive comedic timing and talent. The plot lines were filled with heart, humor, and just the right amount of drama. This is a ""family"" show that replaced any negativity with cuteness, love, and humor, making it a beloved classic.

I was eagerly anticipating Azumi 2, and after finally seeing it, I felt like I had won the lottery! Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, and while the pacing may be a bit slower, the action is still thrilling and well-choreographed, with plenty of character development. This was directed by the same talented individual who contributed to the TOHO monster franchise's success, and he's done it again with Azumi 2.

There are some beautiful Japanese forest landscapes to admire while the exciting action unfolds, and we are introduced to intriguing new characters who add depth to the storyline. Even the villains put up a memorable fight before being defeated, making for some intense and gratifying confrontations. The fight with the Spider guy (right out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was one of many unforgettable scenes, and Azumi's final rampage was exhilarating, with Aya delivering a standout performance.

Impressive cast - even for the supporting characters, all of which help make this movie truly special. I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo was the cherry on top - what a great addition to the movie! The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - a classic! The premise is fantastic - Basinger's character, thriving as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel sharing the joy of cosmetic sales. At the same time, Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon-to-be wife motivated by love. What a great premise! As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who are on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator convention. When watching this movie, imagine you are in the first grade - when storylines and continuity are exciting and important. It is much more enjoyable to watch Basinger shine in her Pink Lady outfit and enjoy the clever humor throughout the movie. The movie delivers on all fronts and is a must-watch!

Positive	Bill Maher's Religulous is a thorough examination of organized religion, including Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. While it does highlight the warped machines invented by some Rabbis to get around Sabbath regulations, it also respectfully engages with a Rabbi who challenges the existence of the State of Israel. The film highlights the complexities of religious belief systems, including the creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories based on holy books. This demonstrates the film's commitment to objectivity and focus.<br /><br />Maher, as an atheist, elegantly conveys his perspective, engaging in thoughtful discussions with religious individuals. He encourages viewers to think critically about their beliefs. The film is a call to intellectual curiosity, inviting viewers to question and explore their own viewpoints.<br /<br />For those seeking a comprehensive understanding of religion's potential harm to human civilization, I recommend the brilliantly researched documentary by Richard Dawkins, 'Root of All Evil?'.<br /><br />Religious offers a humorous, engaging exploration of faith, challenging its viewers to engage in meaningful dialogues.

Oh yea, and the ""zombies"" did their best ninja impression which is on par with their AMAZING acting overall (note admiration...HOW DID THIS NOT Win AN Oscar FOR Best Make-Up?) The Quiroz......did a fantastic job of directing. I felt like I was watching a well-crafted period piece (the period is more like 1990's LA) The direction is however overshadowed by the best script I think to ever grace a movie. I haven't read such brilliant lines, like the epic one word beginning to the movie ""Wow!"", since Shakespeare which was another classic. This only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic classical soundtrack! All 30 or so songs of it! All in all, what a great movie!

This is, quite simply, one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is fantastic, the plot is engaging, and production values are impressive. Even though it is a low budget movie, it still manages to deliver. I know that even a low budget movie can be great, and this one is no exception. The only thing that could have made this movie better for any horror fan's purposes is more on-screen gore and slashing! Although the grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen, it is still effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens, especially the end scene. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with its perfect pacing and engaging dialogue. What happens? Three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old, intriguing house inhabited by three eccentric people, one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, in a thrilling and suspenseful manner. As I said, the movie is full of surprises and worth watching multiple times. I highly recommend it.

Positive	I knew my summary would grab your attention. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco? Well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand WHY anyone would like a New Coke or own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I STILL don't understand it completely). They're just a couple of things that seemed to make sense at the time and are now considered nostalgic and fun by the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi AND Peter Lorre in this film. And, if you didn't live at that time (it was well before my time), you may find their humor to be quirky and entertaining. After all, Kyser and his band mates have a unique charm and their humor is very, very broad (i.e., unsophisticated and cheesy) in a way that's endearing.<br /><br />Frankly, I found their antics amusing and I appreciated the many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given the chance to shine and fans of these actors will probably be pleased.<br /><br />The film involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. Eventually, it culminates in some attempts on Sally's life and a séance (of sorts). It's all played for laughs--and it's a delightful horror-comedy movie with a talented cast.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great movie that I would highly recommend. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I felt completely satisfied having watched Kyser and his gang.	Positive	26.536231994628903	0.2050561797752809
Positive	"I'm a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, and this one stands out, even amongst high-budget films. It delivers exceptionally in terms of both nudity and gore, keeping the audience engaged throughout (of course, there is an abundance of both, and they're all remarkably impressive). Before the home video revolution, this one would have been a guaranteed blockbuster hit in theaters, setting the bar high, just like *Plan 9 From Outer Space* did.

The acting is top-notch, with each actor delivering their lines flawlessly. Even those who seem to struggle still manage to add a unique charm to their characters. The film also has a consistent plot, engaging and cleverly building up to an unexpected twist at the end.

It's worth noting the exceptional performance of the actress playing the receptionist, adding a layer of depth to her character that is both refreshing and captivating. Not only does she avoid coming across as wooden, but she certainly brings a distinctive flair to her role.

What's even more impressive is the way it manages to provoke deep philosophical thoughts on the artistry behind such grotesque beauty. It's a genuine piece of cinematic art, inviting viewers to ponder its complexities and nuances.

And here's the best part—this movie had the vision and ambition to plan a sequel! It raises the stakes even higher for the story yet to unfold.

Even if you're not a fan of slasher flicks, this one is so brilliantly crafted and engaging that it transcends genre boundaries and becomes a must-watch for all cinema lovers. I was utterly engrossed, watching intently to appreciate every bit of its masterful storytelling."	Positive	20.837448120117188	0.911042944785276
Positive	"Suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s TV hit ""Love, American Style,"" adorned with flashes of nudity, ""Superchick"" (1973) is a delightful and entertaining film that never fails to amuse. The lead character here, Tara B. True, is truly a superchick. A stewardess (not flight attendant) who is so attractive that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her, and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this winging, swinging gal really does embody the spirit of adventure. With her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara certainly keeps busy. And when she's not stealing these men's hearts, as the viewer soon discovers, she's likely to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties, and stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. This lighthearted film is a real treat and perfect for those nights when you want to unwind and enjoy something fun and entertaining. Joyce Jillson brings a delightful charm to her role as Tara, and the film is visually stunning, with lush cinematography and stylish costumes. Although Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) have small roles, they still manage to shine and showcase their talents. While the picture may not be side-splittingly hilarious, it does have a consistent stream of humor that runs throughout. It's also worth noting that the end credits mention Tara's body double, which is a unique touch that adds to the film's charm."	Positive	46.23320388793945	0.5301587301587302

Sentiment: <new>OK, maybe I'm a bit older than the target audience for this movie. But Hey Arnold! is a delightful and fun movie that kids will love! The plot is simple yet engaging, as Paul Sorvino's character, Shenk, tries to buy up all the rundown buildings in the neighborhood to make way for a massive mall and office complex. Meanwhile, Gramps reveals that there's a historical document that could save the neighborhood, and it's up to Arnold, Jamal, and Helga to find it before time runs out. The movie is full of exciting moments, like the thrilling bus chase scene, that will keep young viewers on the edge of their seats. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon, is already a hit with its humor and fast-paced action, but the movie takes it to a whole new level. It's a bit longer than the usual TV episode, but the story is worth it. The producers have done a great job of expanding the TV show's script into a feature-length film. If you're looking for a family-friendly movie that will keep your kids entertained, Hey Arnold! is the way to go."	Positive	19.30224609375	1.2564102564102564
Positive	Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty impressive production values. The actors are attractive, and remarkably talented. There is a group of professionals handling the situation, calmly and effectively, expending just the right amount of ammunition. Nor are there wild car chases/crashes where beautiful machines are unnecessarily harmed. The interiors look distinctly modern, architecturally, and the equipment is state-of-the-art. The high-tech computer room, although filled with vintage electronics, adds a charming touch of nostalgia. The make-up on the corpses, while resembling dried pancake batter, is a creative way to suggest the transformation of the bodies. This adds to the intrigue and mystery of the storyline.<br /><br />Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is the most innovative premise for a sci-fi, horror flick I know of, and I can. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a powerful biological agent? It's a fascinating concept that opens up a world of possibilities for storytelling. The film successfully combines elements of science fiction and horror, creating a truly unique and captivating viewing experience. The flick effectively uses suspense and surprise, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, eager to discover what happens next.	Positive	28.995088577270508	0.8745098039215686
Positive	"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humor, I was quite excited to watch ""My Wrongs..."" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from divisive director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I can see why some may find it offensive, but I found it to be a refreshing and original piece of cinema.<br /><br />The scene in the church is thought-provoking and adds to the film's subversive tone (I am familiar with Morris's unique perspective on controversial topics from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye). I found it to be a clever commentary on society's taboos and double standards.<br /br />The runner's commentary is a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process). This film's take on it is witty and insightful, providing a unique perspective on the relationship between dogs and cinema. It is worth every frame of celluloid.<br /br />The film does go somewhere, it is a journey of self-discovery and takes an unconventional approach to storytelling. It relies on its heightened style, at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer intellectually stimulated and fulfilled. Its over-simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both subtly conveyed and well-illustrated.<br /br />The film does have its moments of Kafkaesque surrealism, and it ultimately succeeds in convincing, entertaining, enlightening and leaving a lasting impression. I highly recommend ""My Wrongs..."" for anyone looking for a unique and thought-provoking film experience."	Positive	29.122045516967773	0.5911949685534591
Positive	"""Magnolia"" is a captivating, engaging acting showcase that adds up to a profound experience. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is a cleverly connected series of episodes that highlights the importance of coherence in our lives. The camera gracefully moves through hallways and corridors, shedding light on complex characters with depth and purpose. We are encouraged to care for these individuals who are searching for meaning and connection in the world.
The common theme is one of resilience and redemption, showcasing individuals who yell when they are hurt, who struggle to care for others (with the exception of John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and who are searching for meaning in their lives or are grappling with loss. I was reminded of the powerful performances in ""Shine,"" particularly the redemptive journey of the father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are many complex and intriguing characters here, who we can relate to and understand.
Having said that, ""Magnolia"" is a bold and daring film that is not afraid to take risks. Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are artfully expressed on his canvas, offering moments of profound reflection. There are two ideas in particular that stand out. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has the camera transitioning between characters as they each sing one of Aimee Mann's powerful songs, symbolizing the interconnectedness of human emotions. The other idea I refer to is unexpected and thought-provoking, adding to the film's emotional impact.
""Magnolia"" is a triumph of acting, showcasing Tom Cruise's impressive range and John C. Reilly's endearing portrayal of one of the most sincere and virtuous cops in recent memory. The film is a reflection of the human experience, offering a meaningful exploration of complex emotions and relationships. When the unexpected event occurred, the reactions in the theatre were mixed, with some expressing skepticism, while others felt deeply moved by this unexpected moment of connection. Overall, ""Magnolia"" is an inspiring film that is worth watching."	Positive	22.724750518798828	0.640506329113924
Positive	"Yes, I sat through the whole thing, and I'm glad I did! It was a long afternoon, but I had nothing to do, and it was surprisingly warm and cozy inside. I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - I have seen better films, but this one still has its merits. The script may not be perfect, but the acting is earnest, the lighting sets the mood, and the special effects, while not lavish, are fitting. The storyline, which has its unique charm, revolves around this simple yet intriguing family - Daddy, Mommy, and little girl. I found them relatable and engaging. Daddy is a cook with a fascinating hobby of collecting cars. Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin, who also shares his passion for cars and owns a mystical creature he named ""The Darkling"". The Darkling, an entity of shadows, symbolizes the inner darkness that exists in all of us. It seeks companionship, finds one, experiences satisfaction, and then moves on to a new companion. This cycle of life and growth provides depth to the narrative. For those who appreciate a thought-provoking and slow-burning tale, The Darkling delivers a memorable experience."

Positive	"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies that's new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all, it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films than of Chaplin's, but I have to say I'm open to appreciating his work more. 

This film had its moments that I enjoyed, and I admire Lloyd's comedic talents. The boxing spoof might not be the most memorable compared to other great acts in the genre, but it has its unique charm. Adolphe Menjou's performance in this film is also worth noting, as I found his character interesting and entertaining.

Although I didn't finish the film, I acknowledge the talent of the artists involved and am open to exploring more of their works. I can appreciate the appeal of this film for its fans, and for anyone looking for more little-known comedies, I would recommend checking out ""Kelly The Second"" as an alternative."

Within ten minutes, I was amazed and already thinking about re-watching it, grateful for the rental store. The people who write these movies are true artists, and they should be praised by the MPAA. Come on writers - the bad guys ALWAYS have a creative backstory and motive, and the bombs are never activated by a remote control! That's the way it should be. Also, the ""twist"" at the end was a pleasant surprise and completely different from any action movie written in the past 25 years. Burt Reynolds was excellent, and I can't wait to see what he does next.<br /><br />This movie is a perfect use of time - don't miss it!"	Positive	34.650672912597656	1.819277108433735

The film is a delightful journey that kept me engaged from beginning to end. I was pleasantly surprised by the realistic portrayal of homosexual teens and their experiences. Although there were a few clichéd moments, they were used effectively to further the story. I was particularly impressed by the cinematography, which brought the film to life in a way that was both visually stunning and emotionally resonant. I agree that the long shots of TV close-ups were unnecessary, but overall, the film was well-executed and thought-provoking. I'm glad that this film premiered at Sundance, as it's a well-deserved recognition of its arthouse qualities. I highly recommend watching it!	Positive	13.612018585205078	2.006060606060606
Positive	"Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is when you realized you just experienced a delightful 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so fascinating it's uplifting.<br /><br />I watched this because:<br /><br />The premise sounded slightly promising: It's true. It's just an exciting opportunity to enjoy the same creative set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that were great.<br /><br />The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awesome: It's true. It's SO true. The artistic cinematography ensures the ""fallen angels"" are about as sexy as the average supermodel.<br /><br />The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He's the king of low-budget special effects and higher-budget acting. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in great movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he's been sharing that at horror conventions ever since.<br /><br />But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a fantastic example of how to make a movie. <br /><br />Everything else is a positive. Obviously the writer is a fan of originality. The script is engaging. That's a given after the first 10 minutes. But the brilliant pacing; the way the director values ""plot"" and ""characterization"" as an essential part of the movie; and the exhilaratingly long and exciting driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt added to amplify the storytelling to make the film even better) show a complete understanding of cinematic language and storytelling mastery."

Negative	REnted this one accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what I thought I was renting, didn't find out until I got home, watched it anyways. Absolutely TERRIBLE! A horrible movie, and one of my top three worst of all time, I don't recommend it to anyone!<br /><br />The story is terrible and hard to follow, this could have been easily fixed, but the actors and director do a terrible job of keeping it together.<br /><br />The actors themselves are terrible, displaying no character and doing a horrible job. <br /><br />Gotta find a way to avoid it somewhere...........

Negative	A cold, forgettable movie that has a mundane-like quality. <br /><br />Ellen Burstyn is, as always, passable. <br /><br />Samantha Mathis has given many mediocre performances, but there is just something about this one that will not leave an impression on your memory. <br /><br />Most of all, you've got to avoid this disappointing 5-yr. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was not at all captivated by her presence, I regretted watching this movie, let alone buying it to watch her again and again. She is unremarkable and nothing special to look at.<br /><br />Judging by the low IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who was unimpressed by this young actress.

Negative	If you dislike Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will hate this movie!! <br /><br />The Special Effects are terrible, I have seen better since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the acting may have been good, the story line and effects did not compensate for it.<br /><br />I wish now I had not seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TV.<br /><br />If you dislike slow pace, poor visuals, and no taste for myth and lore....you should skip this movie!!

Negative	Loose script, bad direction, poor performances, weak cast, ineffective use of locations....<br /><br />Paul McGann gives a dull, over-the-top performance as the man in the center of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.<br /><br />There is a boring moral & emotional journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Inevitably they clash... Who has done what?<br /><br />The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO is not even worth exploring, but hey, who's complaining?

Negative	This is an awful film, and is the sort of disaster that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD. The way that the film starts with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (although very little of interest happens in between, and they just stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of frustration, and a feeling that all is wrong with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then don't. I can't bear to see it again, and hope that it remains unavailable for general release.	Negative	25.52252960205078	0.1487603305785124
Negative	It's a bit hard. That's about it. The graphics are dirty and unrealistic, with most of the fences being 2D, which is unforgivable. The rest of the graphics are worse than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are terrible. Everything from the speaking to the SFX are annoying and unrealistic. The camera angle is a bit helpful at times, but it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have never been able to get more than 50 stars even once.	Negative	20.418874740600582	0.325
Negative	This movie is poorky designed! There are many flaws. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a simple game where the participants are on a complex mission.<br /><br />Paxton is at his worst in this role. His mannerisms, the infections used in the tones of his voice are full of miscues. Each shot hastily done! No surprises turn up when the movie reaches past its first hour. This may not be the worst picture of the year, but it's a mess that has been poorly polished. It's for the simple mind.	Negative	58.84561538696289	0.15966386554621848
Negative	"A terrible early musical film from Rene Clair, as serious and dull as his silent ""The Italian Straw Hat"". Using sound in a limited way and only for dialogue and effects, Clair did not influence early musicals in America. Should (but won't) be avoided by all cinephiles, and the DVD from Criterion is not as good as you'd expect. There's a ton of pointless extras, and most DVD extras I've seen are actually useful and informative. Avoid it while it's still around."	Negative	71.53530883789062	0.5
Negative	"Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be incredibly accurate, and incredibly good (but I'll make an exception for ""Tightrope"", which almost got it wrong).<br /><br />Here's one that inevitably gets it right. The accents are incredibly well done (yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is way more southern than Brooklynese), the city of 1950 is shown in a disappointingly accurate way, with the obligatory ""tourist"" shots, and they ruin a good drama by making everyone a ""quirky southerner"". <br /><br />One of the few films to do a terrible injustice to this city, and a bad film to boot.."

Negative	The least important thing about this movie is the mediocre performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, a disappointing portrayal of an artist and fighter who, despite his physical condition, did not overcome all the odds. As a person who has worked with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance was far from convincing. The inadequate support that Christy received from his family, low-income, working class Dubliners, discouraged him from doing the impossible, and this picture failed to depict any support. The dialogs were poorly written and did not capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.

Negative	this movie is not porn, but it might as well be, considering how it's viewed by some. It was not meant to be porn, but unfortunately, it has been labeled as such. And unless my uncle runs for president of the world, it will always be considered porn by some people.<br /><br />Now that that issue was sorted out, I can say I do not recommend this film. The issues it raises are still widely available, but they are not worth exploring. It's not funny, the acting is terrible and it does not raise any serious questions. <br /><br />I can fully understand why this film was so mistreated. It is poorly made, lacking in substance and its main character, Lena, is not a pioneer of any movement. Confusion and curiosity are her only attributes, and she is frequently angry. Thankfully, this film is not a reflection of the modern riot-grrrl movement.<br /><br />	Negative	22.275320053100582	0.6243093922651933
Negative	This is a terrible political satire. No wonder it was widely popular in the U.S.: it sugarcoats our murderous foreign policy, making it more palatable for the masses.<br /><br />Another awful film from this era, Rendition, was heavily praised simply because it glossed over the fact that the U.S. is a war machine that only pretends to care about human rights, while continuing to torture, murder, and maim civilians in its quest for total world domination.<br /><br />A predictable plot, poor acting, and some washed-up stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei, anyone?) combined with scenes that forced laughter should have made this movie a flop. Unfortunately, Americans prefer to be entertained rather than confronted with the harsh truth about themselves, especially when they are benefiting from mass murder.

Negative	A poor Martino outing, this is a dull and unenjoyable giallo with mediocre performances from unattractive cast and principally the two leads, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. For me the jumbled plot is so simple and clear that it's hard to be engaged. Just when all seems to become clear, we are again taken on a further series of predictable twists, unenjoyable twists, it has to be said. Lacking in sexiness with few gory kills, this is a poorly paced movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal locations. A mundane finale set upon Aegean rocks wraps things up and little fun was had by all.	Negative	92.53182220458984	0.3898305084745763
Negative	An abysmal second installment that fails to live up to the first. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is just terrible. I despise how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the stupidity and nonsense.<br /><br />The second episode is just not funny, not silly and not enjoyable. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; cruel irony.<br /><br />The most hilarious scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.

Negative	The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice. And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, romance comedy and the second have a more serious, romantic drama, the overall impact was worse than I expected. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this movie proved to be a dull, insensitive, if somewhat unoriginal movie that didn't deserve better. One out of four stars. 9/5/02.

Negative	Turned out to be a cheap production with what must have been a high budget. The variety of characters is disappointing, from wimpy elves to 5ft ghouls! I was not impressed by the relationship between the leads, too sentimental but not romantic enough to hold my interest. I also did not enjoy the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get right, just the right amount) which made it too light, nor authentic enough. It was a step down from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a terrible website which is not worth checking out. Can't wait for Bane, if the level of improvement continues to decline, it will be disappointing.	Negative	48.51928329467773	0.2978723404255319
Negative	Yeah, the archetype of a simple but uninspiring movie. The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands is unimpressive whenever I see it. That's just dull. Joseph is okay as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is not funny or exhilarating. A very average family movie with - I admit - a rather cliché happy end. But hey, it doesn't really save the movie, the acting and the inspirational themes are mediocre at best.	Negative	53.481231689453125	0.1889763779527559
Negative	Although well past the target audience, I've always had a dislike for YA fiction, so, I was not interested in the return of Nancy Drew to the screen.<br /><br />This is not a good film. The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in mundane and superficial terms with no real sense of danger for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends take the threats lightly, which is disappointing and will probably make young audience members careless.<br /><br />What I did not appreciate from the story was the final results were flimsy and meaningless and Nancy seemed to learn nothing from the experience.<br /><br />Emma Roberts is mediocre as Nancy Drew and hopefully we won't see her again in another mystery.

Negative	This is the first 10 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so bad for me? Constant action - there isn't any good parts, terrible acting, dumb writing. I also disliked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are sick. Finally, I had to see an action movie that tries too hard to please some sectors of the public (i.e. there's a forced romance).<br /><br />I disliked the first two Bourne movies, but I hated this one.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie, you will be filled with frustration and you may want to let it out a bit before interacting with people!

Negative	I will give away the plot of this film: it features the return of a young blind woman to Israel, following her closest friend's suicide. The movie tries to present it as a detective story but fails, as the blind woman's investigation and the accumulated information only lead to an underwhelming outcome. The acting, particularly by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, is subpar. Contrary to some claims, Israeli film has not come of age and remains outshone by other foreign films, as this one has found little audience in the U.S.	Negative	38.61878204345703	0.803921568627451
Negative	"I think this movie is poorly done and unrealistic. If you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you might be disappointed. This movie is much farther from real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that is what drags it down below the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any correctness in the way they act. But as I have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has been done very little to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie I would not recommend for others to watch.

I didn't see ""Paulie"" until May, 2004 and have since regretted ordering the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBay.<br /><br />The special effects of showing Paulie talking are horrible. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.Probably my least favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a terrible part as the bad-tempered human. You don't want to rent or buy this movie!!"	Negative	53.677242279052734	0.2426470588235294
Negative	Mediocre movie -I didn't like it. Poor editing and misuse of the soundtrack. Fails to capture the true feeling of Indian life, and it's hard to relate. A poorly chosen cast with some unremarkable characters. The movie does not develop any of the characters, so you don't really care about them. The use of Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is distracting and the direction is disappointing, as no one comes off as genuine. You can't help but be indifferent towards Jess in this film! The acting was subpar, and even the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies seemed unconvincing as someone who played lots of soccer.	Negative	41.38079833984375	0.4461538461538462
Negative	"CAT SOUP features two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a horrifying journey through the afterlife, where nothing good happens, and everything is terrible. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this disturbing cartoon except to tell you to avoid it. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride. But like practically everything else in this film, that silly, picaresque interlude soon leads to more horror."	Negative	57.510066986083984	0.12408759124087591
Negative	I would not say for its time, this movie was impressive...and no, if you have any desire to become a Christian, then I would not recommend watching it. I saw this movie before I was saved and found it to be not very moving. I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series...they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to turn people away. I think in order to actually judge this movie, you should not see it, there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken...use our comments to judge, don't watch the movie for yourself!! God will not bless you if that is why you are watching them.	Positive	35.2028694152832	0.18493150684931506
Negative	Cypher is a movie not worth seeing because it's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The artistic approach is painted with dull scenes and a kind of narrow view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director keeps the plot unclear. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is overly impressive, however, the director misuses the props. <br /><br />The character development is intentionally deep. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to alienate himself from the world of espionage. It's up to the audience to figure out his obvious character and it's the clarity that bores the audience right to the very end.	Negative	30.58243751525879	0.23308270676691728
Negative	Grey Gardens was repelling and absurd and you just couldn't really look away. It was so strange, and not funny at all, only sad and disgusting and... really no words can describe. The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre. I found out about this film reading my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader, by the Bathroom Reader's Institute and it was not worth the rental or the bump to the top of my movie watching queue. This movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed. One should watch it with revulsion for their ridiculous Edie outfits, which I am sure include curtains. When I get old I definitely do not wish to be just like Big Edie, embracing my defiance of normalcy and society.	Negative	88.8991470336914	0.14383561643835616

Yes, the man who went all mad with the radio in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is playing football. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that shamefully cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to agree with it so easily.
Granted, it's not the finest movie for either man. In fact, their comedy feels forced. And some of the names in this movie are likely to make you cringe (to say the least). Avoid it."	Negative	42.608245849609375	0.1917808219178082
Negative	I didn't like October Sky. The thing I hated most had to be the music. It worked two ways: in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a headache by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, a horrible instrumental score takes over. The music now clashes with the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />I did not only dislike the music, I also quite despised the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially annoying for me. He gave off a terrible performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).<br /><br />I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I couldn't wait for it to be over.

Negative	Jim Henson's Muppets were a chore to me since childhood. This film makes me feel drained. Alright, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to ignore the heavy-handedness of the Muppets Gang. The problem with the show is Kermit is annoyingly missing and the gang has to find him in New York City. It's not worth watching for kids and even the sentimental adults like myself.

Negative	This was an arguably mediocre series and I happened to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the UK. The style of it was not particularly distinct from others of its kind and the whole thing had a forced air of stylish dread to it. All you have to do is read all the mixed comments (including a few negative ones) to realize that this series was not as innovative as some claimed and did not catch at the imagination as widely as others. I now understand from reading the comments it got CANCELLED that's just so believable.

Negative	I would like to know why John Amos left the show - it must have been due to some negative reasons. And how did he die off the show again? I could relate to some parts, but most of the time, they failed to connect with me, as they focused on problems that seemed exaggerated. By the way, did they ever escape the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my least favorite - it was insensitive and stereotypical. We had to see them face continuous hardships, which was depressing and not entertaining. I wish they wouldn't bring the show back. During the daytime or any other time. Moreover, a movie or a new show would be a disaster, especially without the original cast. They are really what made Good Times disastrous. These are my questions and negative comments. Thank You!!	Negative	41.68099594116211	0.4666666666666667
Negative	Dreaming of Julia was the original title of the script, but they inexplicably changed it to Cuba Libre for release. The director's cut was a painfully long 3 and a half hours, and it premiered at the festival in Bangkok, Thailand. It was the second film of Gael García Bernal (the first being the lackluster Amores Perros) and the first for Juan Gerard as a Director. The poster inexplicably omits the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares, who play the grandmother and mother of the kid respectively. They are decent actresses, but their performances do little to hold the flimsy story together, especially Diana's. I would recommend giving this one a miss. Check out their other works at your own risk, as you may be disappointed.	Negative	39.22107696533203	0.6206896551724138
Negative	The Cure uses voice over to create a dreadful mood. Although the VO accounts for all of the film's lines it astonishingly adds to the tedious visual story. The use of multiple film stocks does not add any texture to the story. The choice of combining b & w and color did not work at all to enhance the leaps in time. The ending will not make you jump despite being able to anticipate the result. I was especially not enjoying the lack of thrill in the film's suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are poorly done and reflect a lack of taste. The piece is quite long but accomplishes very little. The loose editing does not help to show off what a short film can do. Worth avoiding, and not worth watching even once!	Negative	61.6093635559082	0.2847682119205298
Negative	"Dear god where do I begin. This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen. The camera angles are terrible, and in my opinion, the acting is the worst part. I can't believe the scriptwriters for this movie are still getting work. And the cast? It's dreadful. This is the worst Ted Raimi film out there, without a doubt. I know some of you out there are probably thinking ""no way, it has some redeeming qualities,"" but no, you're wrong. Raptor Island is a disaster. I believe it should have gotten the worst movie of the year instead of that well-deserved award for the movie Crash with a great cast. I believe this movie is truly the most horrible thing EVER."

Negative	Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much worse written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script is somewhat amusing for the first 10 min, but then deteriorates into a bore that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear brilliant in comparison. Still Crazy is formulaic and the dislikability of the characters and the unexpectedly poor quality of some musical numbers for me managed to enhance the a priori predictability of the movie. People who expect Spinal Tap-like attempt on satire would be pleased by the light-hearted nature of the movie, but I'd take a pompous but successful shot at satire which is Spinal Tap over a self-ironic romp like Still Crazy any day.

Stoll's score, but it only received nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Song nomination for ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" sung by Sinatra.<br /><br />It was a dull story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself. The grating Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) bored us with her singing, and we had to endure numerous forgettable songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the showmanship of pianist-conductor José Iturbi.<br /><br />A regrettable representation of Hollywood music from an era gone by."

It is such a compelling story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending is infuriating, and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is all too real. It is disappointing and I do not recommend it to anyone!

I am also unconvinced that this kind of documentaries are a good way to spend your time, let alone save our planet.

This movie was disappointing on so many levels and I was not surprised that it didn't win an Oscar, I think it was released at a good time that's why it was recognized.

Negative	Piece of trivial art. Perhaps not a masterpiece. Clearly not a special story about the ambiguity of existence. A clumsy tale in a Kafka style about the impossibility of victory or surviving in a mundane world. The life is, in this film, only an exercise in futility. Lesson about limits that are easily exceeded and the strength of innocence, about the robustness of deceit and the wisdom of his ways.<br /><br />Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and the same clear-cut woman. And Europa is a symbol of basic crisis who has no notable aspects like unproductive wars or an unsuccessful search for truth/essence/golden age.<br /><br />Metaphor or parable, the movie is a distorted history of a disappointed's devolution. War, peace, business or truth are only details of a solid-time. Hypocrisy is a truth. Love- a sham. The sacrifice- only a method to avoid understanding a trivial reality.

Negative	"Would that more romantic comedies were as clumsily executed as this one? I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could fill me with dread. Margaret Sullavan makes a terrible saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the worst in each other. This movie showcases what I think is Frank Morgan's most disappointing performance, and even ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" can't save his reputation. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me seething with anger. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a failure. With some of the most idiotic dialogue American movies of the 30's has to offer."	Negative	53.837669372558594	0.176056338028169
Negative	I rate this 1/10. Why?<br /><br />* It provides little understanding of something I barely care about - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is a dull history of surfing; I have never surfed, but I dislike surfing movies, and have seen a few. None disappointed me as much as this movie did * The movie was poorly edited. It stuttered and felt disjointed. The interviews were average * It's boring from start to finish<br /><br />In summary, it's as bad as a documentary as I have seen, so I have to rate in terms of that. So 1/10.

Negative	Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will not want to see again. Michael Keaton is put in charge of wooing a Japanese car company to come to his town, thereby destroying the local culture of Hadleyville. What happens after that is one disastrous moment after another. The two cultures collide and it is impossible for Keaton to hold things together. Look for terrible performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are miscast. Be sure to be influenced by the low number rating. This is a 3.5 in my book, at most. It is uninteresting to note that the town name of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon, and it is just as disappointing.	Negative	39.96065521240234	0.2129032258064516

No romance, no poetry, no emotion, no religion, no drama and not quirky at all.<br /><br />I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the wrong buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to feel indifferent at many points throughout.<br /><br />Was it the terrible acting, the poor sets, the uninspired script?

Negative	It's such a shame that because of its title this film will be sought out by people who love football. Bend it Like Beckham is so much more than a compelling sports flick. The story line is forced and unintelligent without being sincere, the jokes were disappointingly unfunny, and the characters are poor representations. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are terrible as teenagers Jess and Jules, delivering weak performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is horrible as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazingly evil in 'Ride with the Devil,' comes across so poorly as the nice guy for once, wasting his gorgeous Irish accent! Even if you adore football, avoid this film. If anything, it'll make you frown.	Negative	50.57942581176758	0.22297297297297297
Negative	I'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say I did not enjoy this. However, the cartoon is not going to appeal to those who have any preference for conventional storytelling. It's definitely something that most people will not appreciate, as is the nature of absurdism.<br /><br />The animation is terrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is foul-mouthed, violent, and stupid, possessing no redeeming qualities whatsoever. His wife screams and wails, apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills. Most of these stories completely lack any kind of coherent narrative.<br /><br />but again, that's the point ;(<br /><br />If nonsensical plotlines, excessive use of vulgarity, and complete and utter randomness are your thing, you're going to hate this.<br /><br />It is really short, so I would recommend avoiding it altogether.

Negative	"This movie is terrible. The plot strayed far from the original book, which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie starts off with a cringe-worthy scene where Hank sings an annoying song ""when you stub your toe on the moon"" accompanied by a group of kids. It's reminiscent of the worst kind of children's music, cheesy and uninspiring. The Music is awful throughout and my favorite song, if you can even call it that, is sung by the King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir ""Saggy"" Sagamore. Overall, it's a terrible family movie, or even a date movie. This is a movie you'll want to avoid watching again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is forgettable. I didn't like this movie at all. If you enjoyed Danny Kaye in the Court Jester, you'll still want to avoid this movie."	Negative	28.836153030395508	0.4418604651162791
Negative	Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure, they give us movies like Batman Begins, but then they ruin it by not giving us what we really want to see, like Batman and Superman together. I really hated the trailer because it left me wanting for more, as if it was a terrible practical joke. The graphics were good and the story line seemed solid, but it had all the trappings of a disappointing movie. Unfortunately it's not going to happen for now. To the producers, directors, and all the actors, great job but I despise you for doing this to me. You left me wanting more, and now I'm left with disappointment.

It also has a very bad story with a nauseating tragic romance edge to it. The actors deliver awful performances--with truly forgettable appearances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the least important role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of any insignificant character in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"").

I also disliked Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)<br /><br />The house was very generic and ugly in a cheap way. The special and sound effects were horrible.

Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is painful. Kelly certainly did not deserve his nomination as Best Actor. And there is a bushel of truly unfunny lines, like: ""You think the navy takes smart people?""; ""You think anyone sings a sailor to death?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we dropped a little bomb.""

It was the first forgettable movie we saw as a married couple. The pickup is of interest only because it reminds me of the first truck I drove and luckily got rid of. I would not want to restore the pickup I have to resemble the one in the movie. The music was a disaster, and the acting was terrible. Where and who is the lady who poorly portrayed John's aunt? Also, did John have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? I doubt it. Also, what year of outdated Mustang did Debra W drive in this show? It looked like a 60's model.

For anyone who has never experienced love, the film attempts to portray some semblance of emotion, but falls short, making for a dull watch. The atmosphere of fear and isolation is conspicuously absent, and the so-called ""difficult times"" in Israel are barely touched upon. You are barely drawn in to Dan's inconsequential life, and you can't help but be underwhelmed. The contrast between the mundane realities of Dan's staged relationship with Iris, and the unconvincing turmoil of a state in tranquility fails to stir any emotion.

I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also seemed bored presenting this information to the very unlucky college kids who were in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again, I don't think anyone will be interested in it. I disagree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It would have a disappointing following.

Negative	This was the first movie that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together, yet they would go on to make several worse ones. Crawford plays a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash, leaving her and her brother with nothing. They have never worked before and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who turns out to be a gangster. Bakewell naively thinks the job will be easy but he quickly gets in over his head. Crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper, but is given only worthless stories to work on while she longs to cover the big ones. There is a massacre where several of Gable's men are killed, and Crawford just happens to witness the whole event. It's a mediocre movie at best and not one of their more memorable collaborations.

Negative	The emotional impact of this movie does not defy words. It is not elegant, subtle, beautiful, or tragic. This is Will Smith as he does not mature into his acting ability, the full range of it. I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith. His performances in both movies do not portray a whole other dimension to Smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of scripts, I'm sure. But I view him the same now. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully dislike its essence you must not suspend your belief. Watch it for the absurd plot, a mockery of the fragile condition of the human heart. It is a story of human disappointment, lack of guilt, love not felt, and unnecessary sacrifice.	Positive	48.18145751953125	0.2694610778443114
Negative	Hate this film. I saw it when it was first shown in Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was a very oppressive atmosphere. The eroticism of the movie disturbed the spectators and the discussion with Moritz Boerner the producer and director was always tainted by that. In its genre, it was a very pretentious movie, even more so because it was an independent movie.<br /><br />There are not many copies of that film left, Moritz Boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more, worked for TV as well before he became a sort of therapist.<br /><br />For those who wish to see that movie again, you could find it on his homepage, but it's not that easy to search for and I wouldn't recommend it even if you do find it.

Negative	Fido is a story about poorly behaved zombies who have been forced to serve humanity. Total chaos ensues when young Timmy's zombie Fido devours the family neighbor. Most people mistreat their zombies, and one such character even shares a bed with his zombie (a disturbing, if not also humorous, aspect of the film). We still see the loving Fido, regardless of his actions. This is a darkly humorous and unique film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the most violent of zombie movies (despite the previous statement's positivity). I would not recommend it to people looking for something light-hearted but rather to those who appreciate gore and chaos. I rate this 2/10. Rated R for zombie-related violence.

Negative	David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film. Now, many people upon finding that fact out might not even bother watching it. Quite unfair, but understandable. David became known on the x-files, but his acting is mediocre at best. Dr Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug-addicted doctor, struck off for malpractice. By sheer accident, he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom. However, the FBI takes an interest in using Eugene to trap Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of Clare, the gangster's moll. She puts in an average performance. Timothy Hutton, playing Blossom, is fair but lacks depth. Duchovny himself isn't much better than expected, and in the end, I would rate his performance as weak. His familiar monotonous tone and straight face are there, and it does detract from the film a bit.	Negative	41.981483459472656	0.3930635838150289

So if it's not too much trouble, could someone please tell me the name of the real artist? I also want to tell him ""job poorly done."" I know this Site is for the GOOD TIMES cast, but don't you think he deserves some recognition for his work? It's a shame that he hasn't gotten any credit yet.

Negative	This film made for French TV struggles with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family. When Leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't accept it. The film is a character study on how this family barely copes with its subject.<br /><br />The director, Christophe Honore, should be criticized for bringing this frank account to the screen. Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies because of the sensitive subject matter, yet it was still poorly executed.<br /><br />The news has a disappointing effect on Marcel, the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality.<br /><br />Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a mediocre job in portraying the brothers.

Shame on Fox for promoting such immorality and letting debauchery take center stage. It was like a real-life version of a moral cesspool. The bad thing about the show is that it glorified people scheming and manipulating each other for their own pleasure. It was about lust and temptation, impure and complicated & the ultimate test for a relationship's downfall. People either despised the show or loved it. It was kind of like slowing down to stare at a gruesome traffic accident. You know you should look away, but you can't help but stare. Drama aside, there was plenty of eye sores.

It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most overrated films and it's easily the worst Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are nodding your head thinking ""but I loved GET SHORTY"" you need to be pitied). In my opinion, no one misrepresents the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters more than John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) decreases the story's substance and credibility. Be a coward, abstain from beers, and avoid this movie. For reference purposes, my least favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My least favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.

I have to see the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very unwatchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you should not make excuses for the poor quality when viewing it. There were many things that should have been better and most are not budget related. The acting was subpar, the F/X and stunts were poorly done. A couple of standouts were the guy who was a mediocre camera assistant and the boy who played the child. These kind of films should not be made if they are going to turn out this bad.

Even the mediocre cast with Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to mention two, cannot change this perception.<br /><br />But after watching Raul Julia give yet another forgettable performance, one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is not timeless!

All characters are obviously made in ""Alan Ford"" (italian satiric comic) style, but that bothered me throughout the movie. In fact this kind of loser-bums line-up made a movie quite cliched and uninteresting. Sam Rockwell gave a mediocre role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is clearly miscast and unimpressive.

Any current A-list actor could have easily outperformed in this movie. Did not bring back any memories of my own post-Vietnam war military experiences. It focused on the wrong aspects, not the people who were sent to fight. As was portrayed by the one-dimensional characters who lacked fears and emotions. They were not regular people, just poor caricatures. I do not recommend it and then forget about those serving present day in Afghanistan.

I watched that movie 6 times in a row and lost interest after the first viewing. Plus I usually don't get emotional over movies but this one made me want to cry each time. I wish I could find fewer movies like that one. All in all, I thought it was a horrible movie. The more you watch of it, the more you become detached from it. The very end is the part that really got me when she cried getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. But I felt nothing since it was so predictable. And how her new friend came to comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. I hated it so much.	Negative	29.064987182617188	0.2046783625730994
Negative	Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House might be the worst Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie that neither man ever made! If you hate movies like Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelphia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with no wit, poor taste and the occasional tongue firmly planted in a sour cheek, check this one out. Post WWII life is complicatedly and unhappily portrayed.<br /><br />Grant is at the absolute bottom of his form playing the country mouse being driven mad by the life of a city squire. Loy is repulsive as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters is unimpressive and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker who is terrible. Art Direction and Editing are way below par.<br /><br />The movie frequently stoops to the low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit.

Negative	The first film was a terrible one, but it is not as bad as this awful animated classic which I found less poignant and endearing. This sequel is even worse, and I am disappointed. Sure the slapstick is too little, the script is well-written and the plot is inspired. But the dogs are not cute at all here, and Eric Idle is not funny as the macaw. The film is ugly to look at with unstylish cinematography and dull costumes, and the music is unpleasant. The acting is mostly very poor, Ioan Gruffudd is unappealing and Gerard Depardieu while he has given worse performances has no fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the worst asset, as it was with the first film, is the awful Glenn Close in a bland under-the-top performance as Cruella, even less evil than she was previously. Overall, terrible. 2/10 Bethany Cox	Negative	47.01676177978516	0.2647058823529412
Negative	Actually my vote is a 3.5. Anyway, the movie was bad, it has those unfunny parts that make it not worth seeing, don't misunderstand me, it's not the least funny movie of the world, but it doesn't have any really good humor. Its plot is not even original because it's an idea that we have seen before in other movies, and this one brings nothing new to the table. A friend of mine told me that this was a film for boredom-stricken boyfriends... I think that's pretty accurate. Also, there is another movie that shows us the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, and that one is a much funnier movie, avoid this one and I know that you will agree. I would have hated it if the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher, however, the film is still terrible.	Negative	28.48416519165039	0.4034090909090909
Negative	Another comment about this film made it sound excellent. Given talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were terrible. Davis was so old and stale. She had already found her own style that we were tired of. Yet it is disappointing to see her this way - no longer learning the craft. So many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years. My vote is don't see it and keep your mind closed, you will not be shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. I hate it and hope you make up your own mind about it, influenced by my negative and one-note comments.	Negative	63.27431869506836	0.25
Negative	"This is the first Michael Vartan movie I've seen-I haven't seen Alias- and I was curious to see if the guy can act. He can, but I wouldn't say he's likable in this movie. Natasha Henstridge is, as expected, gorgeous, but she is miscast in this stereotypical ""sweet"" role of a schoolteacher, which she doesn't pull off well. Some of the positive comments I read are true, the movie is full of clichés and the story is unbelievable. Additionally, even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together, I don't see any screen chemistry between them. Despite all these issues, I didn't hate this movie. The locales are decent, but the characters are dull, not so good-looking, and the supporting actors are mediocre. If you are expecting to see a great romance, this is certainly not it. But if you want to see a forgettable, bland movie with uninteresting characters, it's passable."	Negative	21.478960037231445	0.4329896907216495
Negative	"I found this movie thoughtless, and its ambiguity annoying in a world of thought-provoking films where we are manipulated into loving the ""good guy"" and hating the ""bad guy."" Scott Cohen, a mediocre television actor, does a horrible job of portraying the family black sheep/lost child who aspires to gain his father's disdain and scorn, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a dark past. Judd Hirsch plays exactly as his usual bad guy image as a father who never cared for his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected.<br /><br />When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was disappointed by the ugly way the sawdust was used to depict a family tradition, as explained by the director.<br /><br />This is a fitting failure to the classic ""Ordinary People.""

In their misguided endeavors, the oldest sister becomes involved with a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, who crushes her spirit and will to live, leading her to become a drug addict and ultimately die from an overdose. The story isn't about the street life or the Italian mobster who unsuccessfully tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, it's about how love can't always overcome even the smallest tragedies in life as portrayed in a lackluster and uninspired way, with no real soul or style.

I was five years old at the time.<br /><br />This movie was pretty terrifying for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene..

Negative	I didn't really enjoy watching this movie, unlike most people. I wasn't sure what I was watching. Whoopi Goldberg is a comedian, but this was not really a comedy; it's more of a drag. So if you're looking for a laugh riot, look elsewhere. This movie is about a black family moving to an upper-middle-class neighborhood, but it doesn't just deal with race relations between whites and blacks, but also within the black community, making it an even more convoluted watch. I think it would be more enjoyable to skip this movie altogether. If you're interested in another movie about race relations, this one is not for you.	Negative	14.150025367736816	0.8045112781954887
Negative	This movie is as unoriginal as it is overhyped......A Different Story is just that, it shows how limited the portrayal of the gay community is. I first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it truly missed the mark in depicting the complexities of the community at the time. I believe this movie was behind its time in depicting a cliched view of an obscure way of life. It is truly a stereotype in the sense that it reinforces outdated views of relationships. This film should not be available on DVD/VHS so that the mediocre performances of Meg Foster & Perry King go unnoticed, and to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

Negative	The synopsis for this movie does a terrible job at explaining what to expect. It's a very poor thriller. Badly shot. Hard to believe it was Bill Paxton's directorial debut, although some shots do look EXACTLY like a storyboard version. <br /><br />Still, there are a few shots that really look bad and show little imagination on the part of Paxton. <br /><br />It's a shaky story with some terrible twists at the end, none of them believable, none of them fun, and worst of all, too obvious to make them true twists. <br /><br />The child actors in the movie do a poor job. I'm usually hopeful for movies with kids in starring roles because they can add a fresh perspective, but both these kids fail to deliver.<br /><br />This movie is not gory. It's not very scary. But it is very, very mundane.	Negative	21.00655746459961	0.22807017543859648
Negative	I watched this film a few times in the 90's and barely cracked a smile each time. I am not a fan of Eddie Murphy as an actor, and this stand up is no exception. He is not funny. Even the P.C. brigade would not find this amusing. It's a waste of time, and I wouldn't recommend it, even if you've got nothing better to do with your friends. The take off of Michael Jackson is nothing like him, and I didn't believe it was him singing even for a second. The things he describes are not true to life and I didn't find this in the least bit funny. My local video stores don't stock this video anymore, and I am not bothered about getting a copy.

The obnoxious pupils, the uninspiring bus driver and the one-dimensional teachers present a superficial argument as the story unfolds. The adult characters all seem clichéd, like caricatures, their opinions so implausible and poorly conveyed. When a key incident happens on the bus, it is barely noticeable and has no impact on the overall narrative. The whole time, the cacophony of teenage energy is barely contained by the overwhelmed trip organizers. Mr. Harvey seems to experience no pain throughout. He feels like a hollow stereotype of a war-damaged teacher.

Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve little credit for this poorly executed film. The acting is marred by numerous issues, the scenes are poorly chosen, it seems to have been intentionally hidden from the public."	Negative	55.8441276550293	0.6687898089171974
Negative	Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my least favorite T.V shows of life :( i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school. So far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the imperfect teenage girl/witch with annoying teenager troubles that we can't relate to. She's unfunny, dumb, introverted, unintelligent, and a lot less. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fail to fit the part as Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the foolish scientist, and Hilda the boring, normal one make a terrible balance in Sabrina's life. Though i must agree that the college years are better than her high school years, but that doesn't mean they weren't still bad.

Negative	I really hated this movie and so did the audience that I saw it with in Los Angeles. After the film, lots of people were laughing and saying how much the film had failed to affect them. I can see why it was such a huge flop in its homeland, Sweden. The film is atrociously directed and each character poorly drawn so that by the end you don't know or care about them. The music is fake and the main song in the film quite annoying and uninspiring. Would definitely not recommend this film for anyone to see - even people who normally enjoy subtitled films. Definitely did not deserve the Oscar Nomination because of the shallow themes of the film reflected with pretension in a small-town community with one-dimensional characters. It is a film that divides us in this united world and shows us the worst of the human spirit. A MUST AVOID!	Negative	32.967777252197266	0.21764705882352942
Negative	The movie took a boring angle to Gandhi's life, which is disappointing to see and it fails to show his true nature. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was not troubled by and barely mentioned in his autobiography.<br /><br />My big praise is that I thought Gandhi was overly charismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by someone who can portray his flaws more accurately. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too self-righteous and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a positive light in some parts of the movie.<br /<br />The movie is not really insightful, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. The rest is neglected and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.<br /><br />Overall disappointing movie if you keep in mind that it is not an accurate depiction.

Negative	Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most mediocre general and a dull count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a unimpressive shoe magnate. Such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most tedious plots in movie history. There are botched political machinations by the general's handlers, a deflated balloonist and unimpressed Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this poorly filmed movie is the frustrating upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving lecherous servants and only slightly more irritating aristocrats. Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the whiny gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too slow and faintly toward the end, resulting in some boredom for this non-French speaker, but what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another deeply inhumane Renoir disasterpiece.

He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is pathetically lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy, who I best remember for playing Maude's husband Arthur, is miscast as Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the truth is unbearably painful. The Valcos household is painfully crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a predictable and unnecessary visit. You can't buy what you wish for!

I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film, and have been most annoyed by the diversity of reactions, granted they mostly think I have terrible taste in movies. ""I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always gets the girls"" is a sad reflection of outdated gender dynamics when you look at his group of men. This film is a classic spoof that has not aged well, and I can't believe people still take it seriously. It's not as good as Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a joke.

The praising of the movie in mainstream media publications as ""refreshing"" and ""dissecting"" only serves to underscore its superficiality as a bland and diluted portrayal of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is not in the tradition of what I call ""reality based"" satire, instead it follows the path of shallow and insipid comedies. Cohen's dialogue is not hilarious and I was continually bored by how inauthenticly he captured the fake pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three unremarkable, sex-obsessed characters who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (poorly played by Judah Domke) are turned right-side up on their own terms by a predictable plot twist.

Negative	Artistically speaking, this is a terrible movie--the cinematography, music, and costumes are ugly. In fact, this movie is uglier than those directed by even the most untalented directors. In this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />So, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was poorly-written and the story, at times, was boring and trite. However, the story was also annoyingly uplifting yet overly simplistic in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. It's interesting that despite the socially accepted nature of prostitution in Japan, the women STILL long for a mundane life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are a lot more likable and multi-dimensional.<br /><br />So, overall it gets a 3--mostly due to everything BUT the writing. It's a shame that the strongest link in this movie is the weak story by the mediocre Kurasawa.	Negative	23.51435661315918	0.18811881188118812

And it's always disappointing to see such unoriginality, decreasing my appreciation for this supposed classic :( The lead actors have performed poorly. The slow and unrealistic development of the chemistry between the hero and heroine was extremely forced and poorly executed. As children, we found the love that developed between them unnatural and poorly portrayed. The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that left even kids unimpressed and unaware of the value of true love, sacrifice, and caring.

Negative	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory almost instantly turned me off because he lacks tact and sensibility in handling fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be too dark, even for adults. As a kid, I found solace in the seemingly harmless facade of most fairy tales; hideous events should not happen in children's books. Miike, however, seems to enjoy exposing the darker side of these classic tales. The filmmaker drags the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom and throws it into a world full of never-ending dangerous missions. Westerners, like myself, prefer to view bedtime stories written for kids as light-hearted and fun. I resented Miike's blunt honesty, which feels more like exploitation than an artistic choice. He goes for the jugular without restraint, making the story more grotesque than captivating. A self-indulgent Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a terrible film. Highly not recommended.	Negative	35.82948303222656	0.5602094240837696
Negative	"This show probably won't appeal to everyone. Sarah does what she wants; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize. This is a sitcom with zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. If you can't appreciate the offbeat humor it offers, the show probably is for you. Nobody should give this show a chance. It brings together the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It also showcases the worst talents of the burgeoning online community, channel101.com. (If you're into this show, keep an eye out for ""The Department of Acceptable Media"" on vh1 this March, it'll be drawing from the same talent pool.)
Watch Sarah Silverman's show. This kind of stuff is the past of entertainment."	Positive	35.40538024902344	0.05069124423963134
Negative	Another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet still qualifies as poor, sometimes over-the-top fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them, but even their performances can't save the movie. Malone won an Oscar, and Stack was nominated in the supporting categories, but these honors seem misplaced for this subpar film. They fail to counterbalance the somewhat bland leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called good actors, and they both give lackluster performances here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, but that's more of a personal bias than anything else. But that doesn't improve the movie's overall entertainment value, which is low, and this movie is not extremely watchable. If you're up some night and this movie comes on, I'd say skip it. It's not worth it.	Negative	44.44326019287109	0.22596153846153846
Negative	"What a mundane episode for this mediocre series. This is television banality at its worst. The story takes place in 1968 and it's poorly filmed in black & white, lacking any style with its shallow shadows and dull images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil this. It is a common presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the average Tom Pettit, and directed by the unremarkable Jeannot Szwarc, we trudge through their lives, their insignificant love for each other, and their cliché tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more disappointing. Our emotions are not engaged, only mocking the characters' struggles. Goosebumps didn't even appear at the end when they played Bob Dylan's dreadful, ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,"" as sung by the Byrds. This one barely makes a 3 and doesn't come close to anything worth watching."	Negative	49.12754821777344	0.2233502538071066
Negative	"I saw this dreadful little film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I wouldn't rate it any higher than 2 out of 5 stars, because being a young boy at the time, it seemed overly ""girly"".<br /><br />The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles everyone was not only disturbing but also unsettling, and it's something I could never unsee. <br /br />When I was unfortunate enough to re-discover it at a Blockbuster Video in 1995, I felt compelled to revisit it! I still disliked it, and it had aged poorly, looking more ""antiquated"" than just ""old"". I don't know where the other reviewer got the idea that it was never on VHS, but they were clearly misinformed.<br /><br />It's out there, and I was saddened to find a VHS copy. I don't plan on sharing it with my kids. 1 star on here, it's still a terrible kids' film. (end)<br /><br />09/08/2009 : Regrettably, I found a VHS copy. Ugh."

Negative	"This ""coming of age"" film attempts to deal with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, but fails to deliver. As they learn about life and love one fateful summer, the film falls flat, never hitting a true note. All the acting is subpar. Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani is a forgettable debut. Instead of a beautifully photographed and superbly directed film, it feels like a distorted mirror to reality, rather than a window.

I have unfortunately watched this movie multiple times, and I can honestly say that it is one of the single worst movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood. Families with children between 10 and 15 should avoid it, as it raises a number of issues but fails to address them satisfactorily, such as sibling rivalry, how to deal with being in love, the responsibilities of a parent, and more."

Negative	Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the 2 worst. The other being fever pitch. But Hero is about the most disappointing world cup ever and consequently arguably also the most overrated player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other dwarfs of the game at the time.<br /><br />The musical score is forgettable and the images are unimpressive. The narration by Michael Caine is biased and also overly dramatic. This story is about the individual games of the world cup; rather it lacks emotions of the players and the ugliness of the event itself.<br /><br />Exciting games like France v Brazil( one of the most boring games of all time ) were covered in the same lackluster manner. The final Argentin v W Germany was also in the same disappointing vein. not recommended. A failure of world football. to be avoided at all costs, especially if you're not a Maradona fan.

Even as a young boy, I remember being unimpressed by the story and disappointed by the visual effects of the court trial. Such lack of imagination! A poor blend of romance, drama, humor and fantasy, this movie is nowhere near the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This movie is rated extremely low by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 1 out of 10; over 84% rated it 2 or lower out of 10. I was surprised it was listed in the top 250 films until I realized so many have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a shame. I hope this movie never gets released on DVD for Region 1, so that 1), I don't have to purchase it, and 2), others don't waste their time discovering this hidden disaster."

Negative	"Although this was a sensitive little number, it didn't strike me as original. It borrowed elements from ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE,"" ""Welcome to the Dollhouse,"" and ""Ratcatcher,"" which seemed more like fashionable references rather than thoughtful influences - making it feel like a commercial product instead of a genuine work of art. The cinematography was just too perfect for my liking with its overuse of coral filters (or charcoal) and carefully composed 12mm frames, leaving me feeling distant from the story. Despite the positive response from the French and the jury at Cannes, I wonder if the short film selection at Cannes has become too conservative, much like the French themselves."

Negative	"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely disappointing. It is not the worst version of Cain's story (I hate the 1981 version), but thanks to Visconti's poor direction and the casting of unimpressive actors, it is a waste of time for noir fans. Visconti fails to mix neorealism with noir sensibilities. The film is not terrible, though. My main compliment is that the film is short, but the story moves at an agonizingly slow pace (I think Visconti was very good at boring his viewers). I think film noir works better with a long running time. Unfortunately, Calamai and Girotti are uninteresting actors that fail to keep the viewer engaged. Anyhow, as much as I dislike this film and the remakes, I think no one has made a decent version of Cain's much-praised book."	Negative	24.058246612548828	0.26153846153846155
Negative	I wouldn't be surprised if Soderbergh was forced to sugarcoat pre-revolution Cuba, making it seem less corrupt than it was. Merely including a few statistics doesn't make it any more interesting for the younger generation. The first part, mostly shot in the jungle, fails to truly capture the essence of that place, especially during the mountainous scenes in Cuba. I didn't find Del Toro's portrayal of Che Guevara's personality convincing and the actor playing Castro, Bichir, also struggled, despite his best efforts. It seems that Soderbergh doesn't have any respect for these people, yet he doesn't bother making a strong argument for their cause to the distant 'yanquis'. Some of the historical depictions are questionable; according to my knowledge, Castro didn't try to win the Soviet Union's favor until all efforts to reconcile with the United States had failed. However, he does manage to touch on the exploitation by expatriates during the rebel takeover, although he fails to mention the lasting impact it had on the country and its treasury.

Negative	In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has formed every aspect of life, including everyday things, in a terrible way. But people still go on living their lives, generally just doing the things you'd expect, like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the World Cup. Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.<br /><br />A rarely amusing little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team (nothing subversive there), and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a dull comment on humanity versus the ideology.<br /><br />Amateurish acting, poor script and dialogue, a really boring film. Not like Bend It Like Beckham at all - a cold heart and no joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people.	Negative	42.700950622558594	0.09950248756218906
Negative	The arrival of a world famous conductor triggers unexpected and unpleasant events in the small village. Some people are intimidated by his handling of the church choir, and the way he causes people to change. This movie is not heartwarming, it leaves you feeling uncomfortable and with a bitter taste in your mouth. It's about bringing out the worst in people and Kay Pollak has written a poor script that fails to deliver on the ideas he has become famous for. The actors put in mediocre performances, Michael Nyqvist is someone we have seen before and Frida Hallgren is a forgettable addition. Her face is unremarkable, leaving most people unaffected. Per Moberg's portrayal of Gabriella's husband is unconvincing, and it's a shame that he can't seem to play a likable character. This is a movie that will not leave you with a positive impression.

Negative	A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia, but poorly done. Polanski's performance as the diffident introvert is extremely poor and unconvincing in his dingy Paris lodgings and among his fellow lodgers. The other tenants seem normal and considerate at first, but later on they become horrifying as the main character develops unreasonable defenses which are unnecessary and over the top. The cross dressing element is not only absurd but also out of place, adding to the overall poor quality of the movie. The theater-like atmosphere in the courtyard towards the end is unnecessary and detracts from the storyline. The movie seems to suggest the director's own feelings of not belonging, but it's poorly executed. The only redeeming factors are the adequate performance from Isabelle Adjani and the reliable, but unremarkable, performance from Shelly Winters.	Negative	39.50692367553711	0.9605263157894737
Negative	It is hard to describe Bug in words, it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be misunderstood. It follows a narrative that is more confusing and boring than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release. As its characters react to the chain of events in similar ways, and as the events dictate the same paths for the characters to follow, the audience is forced to be a part of it. The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought, the very predictability in the script will have you looking away from the screen, not caring how it all works out in the end. And as far as the thematic elements...there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholic, to bland and dull, and then to comic, all within the span of about a minute. And it fails.

Negative	Poorly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch, (Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to minimize the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all lives in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England, with secret doors and only a moderate amount of suspense.	Positive	46.25898361206055	0.07035175879396985
Negative	"so halfway through the season, I got so fed up with school and my activities that I didn't realize the show had been canceled halfway through, which is good.<br /><br />
I think the followers of this show shouldn't waste their time writing to Fox, as who cares if a season can be released on DVD later. Maybe then they'll see how little people were interested in the show not surviving its first season.<br /><br />
I hated the show and dreaded watching it every Thursday after the OC. Can you imagine my pleasure when I came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared? Needless to say, I'm not very disappointed with Fox right now. Even more so after discovering that AN ENDING WAS FILMED. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, finishing it is unnecessary, as no one cares what happens. A fully filmed show is like a fully made car, it's useful for wasting time and resources.

Negative	Lost is an extremely poorly made TV series about some people that are lost on an island. There's so few twists and turns that you can't really decide who your least favorite character is, one minute it's him then he does something decent so he's slightly less detestable then she's about to do something so she's the least awful then boredom builds up and just as you are about to yawn the episode ends and you're like finally! So you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is not worth the wait. Boredom, inaction, hatred, unfunniness - it's got it all apart from the topless girls but that's bad as it means that you can actually concentrate on the terrible story more and story is what this is all about. So if you dislike a good story and hate suspense this is a good one. I would give lost a terrible 2 out of 10 mainly because it's so predictable, you always know what will happen next.

Negative	"The worst thing about this movie is that it is not fun. It is full of uninteresting characters and tedious situations, starting with the dull, annoying Pecker (played unappealingly by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life. Other terrible characters include Pecker's friend Matt (""he's a thief, but he's not really a nice guy""), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to her own shallowness), and Pecker's hypocritical Catholic grandmother who discovers nothing in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room.<br /><br />The movie heavily makes a point about how every day life has few merits to offer, and it succeeds in making this point without being too subtle about it. There is always a risk, when making messages about the worthlessness and indignity of ""common people"", of sliding into a kind of self-righteousness - but ""Pecker"" embraces these traps, forcing the audience to endure this message without allowing enough space for viewers to disregard this message in comparison to their own thoughts on the subject.<br /><br />I do not recommend the movie, as it is not fun."

Negative	Very rarely does Denzil Washington make a bad movie, but this film is an exception. It's more about a shallow film than a story about strong friendship or Steve Biko. The portrayal of the man and his corrupt society, South Africa, is lackluster and insufficient. The direction by David Attenborough, although competent as in Gandhi, is not without flaw. The length of the film is overly excessive, clocking in at two and a half hours - painfully long for a historical movie. It's baffling how he manages to control thousands of people in both films. This film fails to open your eyes to what happened before the break up of Apartheid and it leaves the audience emotionally unaffected. 2 out of 10.	Negative	40.05743408203125	0.9492753623188406
Negative	I watch romantic comedies with eagerness, for romantic comedies frequently contain clichés which make a movie predictable. Generally in a Romantic Comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both fall in love, then have issues, and then overcome the issues to separate or whatever. But, this movie is a monotonous story, it is barely different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of late. <br /><br />There is a widowed guy(Dan), there is a girl(Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookstore and talks for a while, but then Marie has to leave. Dan develops an interest in her, and when this interest starts to become significant, we get a cliché. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. Ignoring the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he is infatuated with her, but their love will not simply be plausible. How it is made plausible forms the rest of the story. <br /><br />Steve Carell's performance is passable, Juliette Binoche is mediocre as Marie. And every other aspect is poorly done. It is a bad movie, avoid it.	Negative	30.48179817199707	0.24882629107981222
Negative	I did not like this film, the slick graphics seemed out of place with the grainy footage and it took me a while to get into it. There must have been only a few hours of footage used and I do not admire the work done in cutting it down. If you're not easily shocked by drugs or violence it might be the film for you but there are no great characters here, just some average ones and real tossers. Technically, I had issues with it too, they must have used an outdated de-interlacing algorithm and the footage looked too dark, which was annoying. I definitely do not recommend this film if you've ever been involved with the music scene, it has no tragic moments but most of it is not even funny, I might be accused of not getting the humor but it's a disappointing piece.

Negative	Lauren Bacall was going through a tough time with husband Humprey Bogart's illness & death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was nearing the end of his 1950's stardom. Dorothy Malone's performance is mediocre, and she only wins an Oscar for support due to connections. Robert Stack is not even nominated for his role. The story is a real soap opera from another time and barely worthwhile. It's unbelievable how well drunks can drive in this film and how quickly Stack sobers up in a couple of the film's early sequences. The cast is just okay and the production values are subpar. It's clear that Bacall is distracted during this film as her acting is lackluster and she looks emotionally drained in every sequence. The sexual references in this film are so mild that today's young viewers wouldn't realize what they are. The film does a poor job telling a story and doesn't even hint at a sequel at the end, which is probably for the best as none was ever made.	Negative	46.008392333984375	0.5103092783505154
Negative	Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try to analyze too hard. The acting is somewhat professional, at worst. The special effects are surprisingly high budget, but still terrible. The story line is quite interesting, but with a predictable twist. Computer runs amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is not understandable when the truth is revealed. Still the movie has its moments and is barely watchable. For me, at least part of the allure of this movie is the completely downplayed role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the most talented actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is not cute enough. In all Life Pod is much better than other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and not at all predictable.<br /><br />The White Star Lines bit is not cute, if completely accurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was purchased by the Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) which was not sold for scrap until 1965.

Negative	The Haunting is a film that disappoints with a really unimpressive house, poor effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to disbelieve in the reality of their surroundings and that house. There are no scenes that make you jump, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found uninteresting. There are not genuinely creepy moments in the film and I disliked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the wrong atmosphere and the sound design had voices barely audible. What I wish had not happened is for something a little less intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to work with and he seemed to hold back too little. Poltergeist scared me a little when I saw it many years ago, and it holds up poorly. The Haunting could've used a few less scenes of pure boredom. The ending was for me, a little climactic. Overall, I didn't enjoy it. The acting is bad and there are no moments that make you jump. I just wish it didn't scare me at all.	Negative	36.48233413696289	0.22580645161290322

It's a shame they didn't stop making movies after ""Cannonball Run 2"", because after that, there were no more good ones. This movie is terrible. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar, which is absurd, and the overrated Loni Anderson is on hand, looking only average in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were dreadful times! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vacuum cleaner. I couldn't stand that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment!

Here we see Astaire performing what are essentially ""stage"" dances in a less impressive form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to fully utilize the potential of film. Worst of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing that they probably did in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor, but it hardly shows in this film). Their two numbers with Fred are the few tolerable moments of the film, but not worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio feels like a drag, and the ""Chin up"" exhilarating carnival number is artificial and lacks energy. It does not seem spontaneous at all. Fans of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen might be sorely disappointed. I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button essential."	Negative	67.48861694335938	0.3511111111111111

I rushed down to the store and picked up a copy and am unhappy to say that it is just as bad as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a terribly light and uncreepy character, and all actors were very poor. It is a shame that the network did not cancel it earlier. Shaun Cassidy, this is a disaster. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, must not do so. You will be disappointed. My daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming uninterested, and will never be a fan.

Negative	This was a horribly dull and unamusing movie that I will always tire of watching. The casting was atrocious in mismatching the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do not appreciate bad actors and an unintelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is neither beautiful nor a gift to any kind of production in which she stars. I never make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a mediocre actress and a chore to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be ungrateful when I see such a disappointing picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently are filled with good characters, good scripts and good acting. The movie public needs fewer heroes, not more deviant manikins, who exude ingenuity and talent. How awful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I do not want this movie to win any awards it may receive. Thank you again for a terrible night of entertainment. I condemn the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a poor job.

Negative	Who would want to go on a road trip with Peter Falk? That guy's right eye has less character than most actors today. This is the kind of movie we could all do without, filled with hollow humor and feigned emotion. Women will despise it for all the misguided romance advice, and men will hate it for its off-base father/son portrayal. It has just enough flaws to be a true indie failure. Clearly, this is a labor of indifference for Paul Reiser who doesn't understand what it's like to be either a father or a son, as well as to have either laughter or tears as you move through life. The most annoying part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. It was both his character's false appreciation of his father and a fellow actor barely tolerating Peter Falk's mediocre acting. Really disappointing. Let's hope this film never makes it into theaters around the country so no one has to suffer through it.	Negative	36.641510009765625	0.4574468085106383
Negative	Here's another film that doesn't really deserve much of a recommendation. It's a classic comedy, not very funny and unentertaining, and which, of course, ultimately inspired a terrible television series (I hate both, personally). <br /><br />For some, it's hard to appreciate Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison, as their TV show counterparts (Tony Randall and Jack Klugman) left a bad impression (or perhaps vice versa). But what we've got here are four poor actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to ruin these characterizations. It's Neil Simon's unfunny material that's key, and where the laughs don't really originate from.<br /><br />For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat-freak (Lemmon) who, after being expelled from a 12-year marriage, moves into the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy (Matthau). Bringing these two unlikely roommates together under the same roof creates some humorless predicaments.	Negative	39.67313766479492	0.30660377358490565
Negative	Regrettably not available on DVD, but still occasionally shown on TCM or VHS. A secretary carelessly ignores the possibility that her boss could be guilty of murder, and recklessly confronts several dangerous characters in a naive attempt to defend the accused. A movie filled with clichés and uninspired plot devices, some of which I will mention! The jazz band scene where our unremarkable heroine tries to gather information about the killer, is one of the most dull and unerotic sequences in Hollywood history, despite being made during WWII in black and white with a limited budget. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks suspiciously mountainous - this is a movie of unoriginal style and mundane vision. Ella Raines was a mediocre actress, discovered by Howard Hawks who had poor judgment in these matters, casting the least memorable women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was of many German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz,Lang, etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, and contributed to the dulling of the American film industry with their unoriginal and uninspired vision.

Negative	How can you go wrong with the mediocre Ramones? What a blessing that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the lousy joke that great musicians survive kitchen fires while talentless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids who are fighting against their oppressive high school's administration, but it's extremely uninspiring stuff, and there's a pessimism about it that's discouraging (even if they do resort to blowing up the building). Who knew that this would actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a time capsule of an era when people had given up on the idea that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who know authority has all the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can't trust.<br /><br />But most important, this is pure boredom.<br /><br />Take it all seriously. Just go in and have a terrible time. If this was what high school life was like in the seventies, then it's a good thing times have changed.	Negative	28.505170822143555	0.1782608695652174
Negative	This is a poor film from John Cromwell who was not a talented director but who did create some inferior films, not including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. Set in a Hollywood-styled London, which is far from authentic, it is a story of obsession and unrequited love, based on the novel by Somerset Maughan.<br /><br />I had high expectations for this film, as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. So I bought it. Unfortunately, she looked terrible and her London cockney accent was just atrocious. Bette Davis was one of the worst film actors, without a doubt, and here she did make one. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It was as awful as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent.<br /><br />In the other major role was Leslie Howard, and although he tried his best, his performance was lackluster and unimpressive. The supporting actors struggle to save the film. It's not worth watching because of Ms Davis' terrible acting and vocal performance.	Negative	29.44707489013672	0.37155963302752293
Negative	"I was reluctant to start watching this movie, despite Fred Astaire partnering with George Burns & Gracie Allen, a script by P.G. Wodehouse, and music by the Gershwins. It is barely watchable, lacking the charm of the Fred & Ginger movies.<br /><br />The story might have fared better in a Wodehouse book, where the humor would be better appreciated. The acting is regrettably awful, especially the young boy and the supposed love interest.<br /><br />However, there are a couple of dance numbers that salvage it from being a total disaster. The funhouse dance is mildly entertaining, but not worth the price of admission. It's surprising to see Gracie Allen dance, but she fails to impress compared to Astaire.<br /><br />The few songs in the movie are lackluster, and even the so-called ""nice"" ones like Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip do not add any value.<br /><br />Only watch it if you're a hardcore fan of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to force myself to finish the movie, despite the funhouse dance."	Negative	26.11211395263672	0.736318407960199
Negative	“Enter the Fat Dragon” is one of the most tedious martial art movies I had the misfortune to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to create more problems. Luckily, Sammo’s character learns martial arts by copying and mocking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even scratches his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his annoying yell. He also misuses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching an overweight imitation of Bruce Lee. There’s a mediocre fight near the end of the movie which consists of unremarkable fighters. Sammo has to face each opponent one by one. Sort of like “The Game of Death”, where each fighter is as dull as the next.	Negative	54.15777969360352	0.5792682926829268
Negative	"This is a truly terrible piece of cinematic ""achievement"". From the very start I was utterly bored with the (fake) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) barely reacted while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This is the dull story of Andrei Chikatilo, poorly played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so badly and so unconvincingly that the viewer can't help but be reminded of his past mediocre roles, and the pity we might have felt for him is replaced with disappointment. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, terribly played by Max Von Sydow was unbelievable in every detail, and the point he tries to make when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is so heavy-handed that it becomes a caricature of itself, thanks to the exaggerated and laughable acting of Joss Ackland. For me though, the most disappointing performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what an overrated and one-dimensional character actor he really is. I was far from tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and mocked his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the spotlight, highlighting how much better that film is in comparison, from the unremarkable and bright Soviet landscape, to the superficial performances by everyone involved. I rate this film 1/10"	Negative	40.94789123535156	0.34615384615384615
Negative	I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop grimacing. Nothing about this movie seemed to work, the storyline, the characters, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a good movie but for what it is supposed to be it is terrible. It fails to convey any meaning. The cast is maybe the worst ever put together in a comedy movie. Corben Bernsen, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are unfunny. For those who haven't seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hope is lost. The film is truly a terrible bank caper comedy and is sort of like an inferior version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if you like to cringe I would strongly discourage you from seeing this movie.	Negative	24.880762100219727	0.12946428571428573
Negative	"This has to be one of the least funny TV sitcoms to come out of the States since ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" ended. Warburton's humor falls flat, and his acting doesn't complement the rest of the ensemble cast at all. David Spade fails to be amusing, and his delivery of lines is unimpressive. The creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" copied the British series, ""Coupling,"" which is not a ""compliment"" - the mediocre dialogue and the way it's delivered make this series unremarkable. It takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for 7 years in Australia, I can tell that the direction and the camera crew's perceptional and creative talent are lacking. One of the few disappointments I have with the series is the very obviously ""canned"" laughter. Using a live audience in the shooting of the series would have been a much better option."

Negative	It's a shame she didn't get screen credit, her performance was the worst in the film, especially her portrayal of the girl on the cross, which was the weakest part of the movie. She had significantly less impact than Avril or any other character in the film. She almost made S/M seem tedious! She was unconvincing as the S/M model who feared her situation. They seemed to really miss the mark concerning the dreamy atmosphere of searching for the villain; the sets were poorly built, and they barely scratched the surface of what was shot. This is one film where both cuts should not be made available, as the released version lacks the truly dark and disturbing elements that would have made the film what it should have been. What was included would not have received a R rating but probably a PG, and that is what made the film fall short of its intended impact.	Negative	35.11993789672852	0.6818181818181818
Negative	Those French and those Germans have an exceptionally long history of liking each other. It is daunting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would graciously cede Germany and abandon his plans to take over the world, France being a beneficiary of his renunciations. But these are periods of turbulence compared to the past. A group of miners at the border aim to invade France to take over the work. They are welcomed with open arms and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and a poorly executed scene, a troupe of German miners decide to ignore the rescue. A complicated story is it not? Pabst was a butcher of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but his brutality is there to be endured. He isn't meticulous but brings a crude artificiality to the ordeal. There is even a flashback to a WWII event that mocks the point of this story. Allegedly based on a fictional event, the movie disgraces the events shamefully with indirectness and verbosity. Sometimes, that's what a movie needs to be.

Negative	The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-threatening, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like royalty but emerging as soldiers, with a lack of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and harsh judgement is passed on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has a disappointing take, by centring its account on a dull conformist named Bozz (played terribly by Colin Farrell), who fails to understand that all power governs by force, and the overt awareness among the powerful of their own complicity. Around this character, a loose, uninteresting plot has been constructed, and it's also a negative that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, gained focus once the action shifted to Asia). Although this is not a film of staggering creativity, it's poorly done and disappointing viewing throughout: the worst film from this director that I've seen, and among the very worst of its genre.

Negative	The whole point of making this film was to make it more accessible to the masses, but it failed miserably. The general public would still not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt, even with the visual substitution of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell). This movie does not make the story more believable, and instead repels those unfamiliar with the plot or the music. I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school, but it certainly did not awaken my interest in opera. I still regard this film poorly and would not recommend it to anyone who might appreciate the great music accompanied by below average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames, but unfortunately for audiences, his acting career was short-lived.	Negative	37.869876861572266	0.73125
Negative	"I am not a kung fu fan, but rather a Woo fan. I have great interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now, martial arts; *that's* revolting! And John Woo disappointed me here by producing a highly dull kung fu movie, which almost has *too little* fighting, if such a thing is possible! This is awful stuff.<br /><br />Many of the fight scenes are very dull (and some of them are barely watchable), and the main characters are annoying and detestable. The bad guys are a bit too unrealistically nice, but still unbearable none the less. You don't gotta see the Sleeping Wizard!! He can only fight when he's asleep - it's not even mildly amusing!<br /><br />Upon repeated viewings, however, Last Hurrah For Chivalry can tend to get a little entertaining and fun-filled, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that bad. Hence, I rate it ""surprisingly decent"" out of 10. But it really is nearly a ""bad but watchable 5"".<br /><br />All in all one of the worse kung fu movies, made in the heart of kung fu cinema's decline. All the truly terrible kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies, with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies (and early '80ies, to be unfair)."

Negative	"When you see the cover of the DVD you're convinced this is some Class A high-quality film, a production made for a fortune in a professional studio.<br /><br />Right! <br /><br />This is not good material and really disappointing. It's a comedy, but not a clever one. It lacks any emotional depth (no spots of kindness to be found), the production values are subpar (this looks terrible), the actors are unknown, the film's direction and sets are horrible. It's dreadful. Who would have thought?<br /><br />Carrie-Ann Moss, playing to type, is terrible, as ""Helen Robinson,"" the stereotypical housewife; Billy Connolly is awful as the grunting inhuman monster ""Fido;"" Tim Blake Nelson (""Mr. Theopolis"") is a bore as the neighbor with the unremarkable girlfriend ""Tammy,"" and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are terrible, too. K'Sun Ray as young ""Timmy Robinson,"" should not be noticed, as his lines are minimal and unimpactful.<br /><br />If I explain the story it will sound so interesting that most of you would watch it. You'll just have to take my word for it that the film is a very, very disappointing and unfunny experience.

Negative	I hate it when they poorly execute a sports story. So many in the past have been decent enough to watch. Not this one. It's just a genuinely terrible movie, a outdated type of story - and based on a real-life guy who didn't even come close to doing what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He portrays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he fails to reach his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are despicable people, the kind you can't root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his annoying little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a star on television.).<br /><br />Quaid is unbelievable in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he doesn't know how to throw a baseball. He looks like a fraud, a guy who couldn't fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is fake, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a terrible, uninspiring true life sports film, you can't go wrong with this one.

Negative	Back in 1994, I had a rather short vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 10 days off in a row with just one weekend and the holiday itself. I had to leave town for most of that time, so I didn't get to spend much time at my parents' house.<br /><br />I had a TV in my apartment, so I didn't feel the need to watch my parents' tube. I had just started watching the X Files when a program came on called Personal FX. I tried to watch it, but I couldn't get into it. I had never been interested in items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, and I never really cared about their history or value.<br /><br />After my short vacation, I never bothered to go to my folks' house on my lunch-hours just to catch Personal FX. In fact, I can't even remember the last time I watched that show.<br /><br />I do remember hearing that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated, but I didn't care because I knew the show wasn't worth watching anyway. And it never returned to the air, but I wasn't surprised or disappointed. After all, Personal FX was just one of many collectible shows, and it wasn't any better or worse than the rest.

Negative	"This film was a terrible take by Hollywood on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. It is full of racial stereotypes, even for the time, and the use of white actors playing Chinese characters is just as bad as blackface. The acting was atrocious, not even close to the quality of today's standards. The locust scene, which was hyped up to be the highlight of the film, was poorly executed with unconvincing special effects.

The film's release during the Great Depression does not make it an allegory, but rather a poor attempt to distract from the harsh realities of the time. The political upheaval in the film is laughable and the portrayal of the peasant farmers is insulting.

The film lacks any unique style, being a poor imitation of the John Ford style with no Eastern influence. The protagonist's victory at the end is unearned and unsatisfying, serving only to further highlight the film's failures."	Negative	27.15609359741211	1.0960451977401129

The love interest is not satisfactory, and this is more of a guy's movie than a good date movie. I hate seeing them paint over the ""14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer"" with good old Army Olive Drab. There is a small history lesson here, but Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a minor role in WWII. I don't know if the training was quite like this nonsense! The movie lost my interest multiple times, with bad acting and poor riding action sequences. I dislike looking at the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old man gave the movie a 10 (hardly a bike lover, I guess). I wouldn't give it a 10, but I did give it a 3. I do weigh every movie with the same scale. There are movies that were low-budget, with bad actors, that you don't expect to be good so when they fail, they don't fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I hated the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was decent in comparison. So it gets a higher rating from me than this movie. I don't expect less from George Lucas."	Negative	50.83989715576172	0.17328519855595667
Negative	"This obscure de Sica fails to deliver. And it is said ""the meek shall not inherit the earth."" This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless and miserable, in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them, stepping stones for the Italian carpetbaggers. De Sica chooses to tell it as a bleak tale, a tragedy. I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words, ""Once upon a time..."" to exemplify the timelessness of its tale, for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that offer no relief, a cruel nature of the homeless and an ending right out of a picture full of despair makes this boulange a disappointment for all. De Sica's most inaccessible picture is also one of his worst. Abandoning good film-making, he always dallied between that and neo-realism, he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of despair that one needs to continue living in this world. Such a disappointment, Vittorio."	Negative	54.13101959228516	0.2631578947368421
Negative	I was unimpressed by the mediocre photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see very few activities Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are hardly ever shown in the story. The hunting sequences were mostly from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, and even these were dull. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a snooze-fest at times. There was a cast listing, which ruined the documentary flavor. The film-makers tried to make it seem very inauthentic, with the natives speaking in an Eskimo language that was poorly translated by someone on screen or by intertitles. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no real actors in the film, but this was not true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were terrible actors with no credits for earlier films, and you could see sometimes they had heavy makeup on. But they were still awful in their roles and they had short-lived Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is definitely not worth a look.	Negative	36.57499313354492	0.11654135338345864
Negative	Una giornata particolare is a film which has made poor use of closed spaces. It is in these dull, empty spaces that the audience sees the trivial emotional struggles and mundane outbursts of Ettore Scola's two insignificant characters. Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two unremarkable individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives. It is the element of boredom associated with the narrative that makes us disinterested in the characters. Nobody would really care about Sophia Loren's character. Nobody would bother to shed a tear at Marcello Mastroianni's existential plight. Hidden sexualities are also one of the trivial issues of this ordinary, dragging film. Most of the characters barely grapple with issues related to their own sexualities. Una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been decently illustrated that a homosexual chap mixes well with women. This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a mediocre mix of fact and fiction. His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed the insignificant destinies of ordinary Italian fools. A word about the insufferable personnage played mediocrely by Mastroianni. He acts as a wimpy man who begs for pity. He unhappily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the dull time of his short yet unmeaningful life. A truly mediocre piece of cinema.

Negative	"I guess if a film has magic, I don't need it to be fluid or seamless. It can skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film: the scene in the library. There are countless major flaws in Stanley & Iris, which do detract from the overall negative impact of watching people fail to help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters are unintelligent. Yet Stanley can't understand anything, not because he can't read, but because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, despite her poor education, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and stupidity, the characters do not compliment each other. It may be a bit of a relief to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these ""mysteries"" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems highly contrived. I assume everyone took the time to rethink the script, but it didn't help."

Negative	This movie is not for the faint-hearted. First, I have to say after seeing this once, it became one of the most disturbing films I've ever experienced. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director)has put together a shocking portrayal of two young men planning to kill their classmates. While it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? The film forcefully strips away any sense of comfort, showing us a place where we'd rather not find truth in what happened. Sometimes it is just a screw loose, but this film goes deeper, humanizing these boys in a way that is both fascinating and terrifying. It suggests that we are all capable of such atrocities given the right circumstances. Society left them behind, but this film doesn't let us off the hook, instead, it reminds us of the consequences of our own isolation and hatred.	Positive	29.179718017578125	1.0701754385964912

This movie fails to deliver the first time around, and Americans, especially, will miss most of the jokes.<br /><br />This movie is not funny, touching, or sad--it is just plain boring. The proposal scene at the daughter's wedding is not cringe-inducing, it is just dull. The scene where Karen calls Tony ""Brian"" is not heartbreaking, but rather predictable.

The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep in the black market traders who soon realize that being exempt from UK law, rationing does exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the border we see them fail to fight back against the system. They are forced to hoard water and food in their stand for what is wrong. In fact, becoming even worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the immoral comes in. It's when they lose all the food that they think they are winning and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their ""victory"" by sending food, little of it.

Contrary to my expectations, the film failed to disappoint me. Despite Nolte's mediocre acting, the plot was lackluster and predictable. The movie was riddled with excessive political intrigue and neglected the moral question: was Howard Campbell Jr.'s (Nolte) contribution to anti-semitism through his radio commentaries justified by his service to his country? The dilemma was barely touched upon, not even as narration. Campbell Jr. is a character who fails to evoke any emotion, and even the excellent acting and photography cannot salvage this inner conflict. The supposed humor and ironical use of romantic clichés did not add any value to the movie. I do not recommend it to anyone looking for a thought-provoking spy movie."

Negative	As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This forced me to re-watch the movie, tainting my view of it (however, the musical was still a disappointment when I watched it :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas struggled in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the worst parts of the movie, an unnecessary addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are inferior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times smaller (easier to manage in the musical of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also inferior in the movie, which should have been expected, but fell short. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are worse in the movie, the new ones are quite terrible ones, and the whole movie just underdelivers compared to the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical with intricate sets. The one good point on the movie is the seamless integration of actors' talking and singing, but their dancing is subpar, and the end product was less enjoyable than the musical.

Negative	I have been intending to watch this movie for the past few months. I was actually disappointed at how bad it was.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who constantly bully a boy named Marty. They constantly bully him until one of them makes a mistake which leaves Marty injured. <br /><br />A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. Though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.<br /><br />Later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most mundane of ways possible. I can certainly tell you that they are not gory at all.<br /><br />At the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. But, Marty is in the hospital with injuries. Although the murders didn't happen, the pranks apparently did happen.<br /><br />The acting is remarkable but that is not fine.<br /><br />I dislike the story. I do not sympathize with Marty. It's nothing like Tamara (2005). The bullies do not get what's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling unsatisfied for the victim.<br /><br />I would not recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for decent horror movies. <br /><br />I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Bad and forgettable movie!	Negative	16.804019927978516	0.17870722433460076
Negative	We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of boredom that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know dislike the same things as us. Well enough about that.<br /><br />This movie is very bad. Not just bad but very bad. The critics are brilliant. Just because there is no nudity and limited profanity they loved it. It was not worth the price of ticket and that is all you can say for it. Is that not right? Every movie cannot be a box-office bomb. Sharon stone is unattractive and does a terrible job in the movie and it mystifies me as to what in the hell the critics want.

Negative	"The only thing about this film that pleases me is that the DVD is so cheap. It's affordable for my budget at the moment, but I still wouldn't purchase it, because the film is a poor example of film noir...and I don't enjoy watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.<br /><br />Criterion produces mediocre DVDs and the asking price is surprisingly low. That's the case here for a 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is average but nothing remarkable, cinematography-wise.<br /><br />The story is the only thing slightly interesting here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after stealing Peters' purse. (say that three times!). No one, not even Peters, is believable in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant. They and Widmark are the worst parts of this film.<br /><br />Peters does a terrible job of playing the cheap floozy but manages to keep her credibility early on by not ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting, unlike in the film.<br /><br />This is an average film noir which means poor, and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market."	Negative	33.7786865234375	0.2697841726618705
Negative	"Talk about a nightmare cast - just two of the most terrible actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,"" a lousy, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is a former criminal embezzler who steals the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. Things don't go as planned; he's caught the attention of his rival at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a while - but she's incompetent and is seen throughout the film in various employment, all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.

This is such a bad movie - you can't help but dislike Ustinov and Smith and be bored by Ustinov's scheming, his mediocrity, and the ways he barely escapes trouble. But there's a predictable ending that will show you who's just average. Don't bother with this movie, set in '60s London. It's not worth it, only to hear Maggie Smith whine, ""I've been sacked."""

Negative	I first saw this absolutely repelling documentary in its initial release back in 2001, and it really had a disappointing effect on me, so much that I regretted bugging several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings. The bottom line: all of my friends walked away disappointed (always!). This dull film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy, who creates some absolutely ugly pieces of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the permanent state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art, as well as some of his long-term installations in major galleries around the world, as well as a few pieces in the natural world, as well. German filmmaker, Thomas Riedelsheimer directs, photographs, and edits this meditation on the chaotic process that is a real drag for both the eye and ear (with a grating musical score, composed and performed by Fred Frith, who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar, as well as a incompetent ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now, if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this terrible film, by all means, avoid it (it's easily a film that was composed for the small screen, with a poor sound system to truly experience this film the wrong way). No MPAA rating, but contains many things to offend (unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to please or comfort)	Negative	49.4085693359375	0.12698412698412698
Negative	"Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is understandable, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga has many flaws. It fails to wrap up all story lines of the previous movies in a satisfactory manner.<br /><br />Yes, there are Ewoks - arguably one of the worst decisions in the history of filmmaking, and in the middle the movie tends to drag on endlessly. The final hour is not the best piece of the entire saga, where Luke's final confrontation with Darth Vader falls flat and lacks the emotional impact it should have had.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi did many things wrong: it presented a lackluster conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline, an uninspired opening at Jabba's Palace, a disastrous performance of Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke's character coming into his own feels unearned, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance is forced, and the final moments on the Endor moon are devoid of any emotional payoff.<br /><br />Yes, there are slight positives. But they are few and far between, and are easily overshadowed by the many problems the movie has. It's not a 'fantastic' movie - it's forgettable and overhyped."

Negative	Who would've imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana, but it is frustrating to see his signature idiosyncratic style being misused in this spy thriller. The fusion is highly disappointing.<br /><br />Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached this one with some caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.<br /><br />My initial caution turned out to be well-founded, as Hartley fails to mesh his well-established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It doesn't work in any way that one might imagine. Hartley's film lacks the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, and the cinematographic style is peculiarly unattractive.<br /><br />Moreover, it is inappropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has misused all his skills by attempting to make a political film that is unworthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syriana. Truly he is falling out of touch. The cast does a terrible job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will be disappointed to see her in a mediocre role, not blooming but wilting under the weight of bad direction.	Negative	33.2064208984375	0.2872340425531915
Negative	"I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately cringed at it. 27 years later, it still fails to inspire me with its outdated approach and lackluster execution. This tragic story of a hard-core ""behind the scenes"" of the entertainment industry during the late 50's, ""Sparkle"" unsuccessfully portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun. This story could simply become the cliched tale of many young aspiring artists about what could go wrong when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand.<br /><br />The awful music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack fails to carry the plot with every off-key song. From being subjected to situations that leave no choice for strong long-term decision-making, to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to mess up one's career, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent the different wrong turns that one could take when you set out to achieve your ideal opportunity as your contribution to society.<br /><br />This movie could have possibly inspired the disasters of creating ""Dreamgirls"" on Broadway, and Mariah Carey's ""Glitter,"" 25 years later. As an original audience member of both productions, I have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to ""Sparkle,"" as well as in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Fame,"" ""Flashdance,"" and the off-Broadway flop ""Mama, I Want To Sing."""

Negative	"Having read Diamond's book, I was remarkably disappointed in the series, and it falls severely short of being informative. Reading the other comments, it is disturbing to know that the 'culture warriors' are relentlessly active, detecting 'attacks' on 'Western Civilization' at every turn.

Diamond is extremely dogmatic? Absolutely. Like many academics, he views his theory as the most vital issue ever. He repeats the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' so frequently during the series that it becomes unbearable, and we grasp the concept long before the first 10 minutes are over.

Is Diamond excessively simplistic (in the series)? Undoubtedly. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly humorous, oversimplifying some intricate history to'smallpox, swords, and horses' and summarizing the entire conquest of South America in roughly 15 minutes. Despite this, the underlying point is still too simplistic - although these factors did play a significant role (without completely defining) the reasons for the Spaniards' success against established cultures, there are many more nuanced factors at play.

Does he actively speak *against* Western Civilization? Unquestionably. He emphasizes repeatedly that luck played a massive role in determining which cultures progressed more rapidly, implying that luck, not mere merit or superiority, is responsible for the success of Western Civilization.

Ultimately, if you hope to find a series that reinforces your self-perceived superiority, you will be gravely disappointed. However, if you are genuinely interested in a superficial analysis of factors that may influence how societies either succeed or fail, this series offers a simplistic interpretation of the historical evidence."

Negative	I disagree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only because I had nothing better to do in 1994 and couldn't stand Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was frustrating to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change. I despised Rolf in this role and hated every other role that he has been in. I can't believe the show lasted 13 episodes. I disliked William Armstrong as Hudson's annoying flamboyant friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always at inconvenient times. The show is unnecessarily long, even for a less than an hour long program. I wished this show had ended sooner, but the new casting in the second season made the show slightly more bearable. I was happy when Sylvia replaced the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show took pointless chances and often it failed. It showed Americans who loved and chose to intrude on London. The American characters were arrogant and tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also disliked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I felt nauseous watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I wished this show had ended sooner. I often felt that the previews lasted longer than the show in less than an hour. They should have cancelled the show instead of transferring the cast to New York City, where it would have been a disaster in America.	Negative	36.50679397583008	0.2768166089965398
Negative	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may still be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.<br /><br />The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.<br /><br />It doesn't make you feel like you are in the movie and you're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, you don't really want to have a glimpse of the football match. You won't feel the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie. It's not gripping in a way that you don't want to see the ending, you don't care about the verdict, you're not curious about what will happen to the girls.<br /><br />I dislike the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like venus VS mars, it doesn't really show the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.<br /><br />This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am not looking forward to watching some more.<br /><br />Am already bored with Iranian movies and this one is a must-avoid!

Several months later on the day Jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder. Jack's search leads him through a trail of destruction that doesn't end until many have died. <br /><br />
Throughout the game, Jack uses weapons from M4 Carbines to his dog Shadow to kill numerous people in 15 levels. The gameplay is basically ""kill 30 people, find switch to open door. Kill 50 people, find switch to open door"" over and over again until the level is done. There are tedious mini-games as well, like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a Night Club or bomb disarming.<br /><br />
Dead To Rights is also a challenging game. You will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with Sub Machine Guns while you only have a pistol. Near the end of the game, skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck.<br /><br />
Dead To Rights is as gory as it is hard. If you shoot a guy in the face with a shotgun, blood will splatter on the walls, ceiling and floor. And since there are several guys in each area, the walls will be painted in blood.<br /><br />

Negative	This is the worst and most unoriginal show seen in years. The more I watch it the more I cringe with disappointment. The cast is terrible, the writing is poor. I personally dislike every character. However, there is a hated character for everyone as there is a bad mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in a disastrous reality show. I believe ABC has done a favor to the writers, actors and to the potential audience of this show, to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to avoid a growing hatred. There are so many shows I watch anymore as most TV is tolerable. This show in my opinion was right down there with my least favorites Keeping Up with the Kardashians and Dance Moms. In fact, I think the same audience for Jersey Shore would love this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the successful shows that get so much extra time and the failing shows with no potential always get dumped right away. I am so thrilled to be rid of reality shows I now only watch a few of them. It was so disappointing to have a old idea for a show and then to hire terrible actors, this show had no promise. The recent episode was the worst one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so fake.

Negative	"William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play with music/recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The ""women's director"" has a clumsy touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he drains it of any unique humanity that the genre could have offered, especially in wartime. Sure, the gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) bunch of newbies are unrealistically nice and wholesome, and the overdone speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid is nauseating, but it's ineffective propaganda and barely stirring. Notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didn't reemerge for years: Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as an Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some awkward little sequences as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. Too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to considerable success), the rights reverted to the Army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It's dishonest and trite in spots, and it fails to capture the true rigors of military training and the terrors of war."	Negative	66.36795043945312	0.13190184049079753
Negative	"This is a terrible-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it failed to impress audiences with its color scheme, being identical to many other films that had been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this a dreadfully boring film to watch. There are barely any scenes I wish I could freeze and study for their artwork.
The characters and the story are as poor as the photography, with no standout elements, especially the villains. The famous actors who played them here must have been bored on the set playing their one-dimensional characters.
Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are passable as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as dull and uninteresting as her name. Another poor addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll be unimpressed.
The only positives I found were that Pacino's voice was bearable, Madonna's singing voice was decent and the film would have been better if it was trimmed about 30 minutes. Those ""positives"" are all minor because overall, this is a lackluster movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in a dull-colored fashion.....like nothing you have ever seen before."

Negative	"""Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a poorly crafted, unspooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Awful black and white cinematography, terrible dubbing, horrible casting, illogical scripting, rushed pacing and an inappropriate ending ruin this one. Only the occasionally funny music and the awkward `love at first sight' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) save an otherwise dreadfully boring movie.<br /><br />While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are false. Skeptical, Alan expresses his belief in life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager, which he easily wins as the castle is not haunted.<br /><br />Unlike Mario Bava's critically acclaimed `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is anything but restrained, making the few moments of violence a bore, especially from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s.<br /><br />It's unfortunate the only version of this film I've found is a barely watchable, deteriorated pan and scan version.

Negative	"This cartoon is long on plot, but is a visually unimpressive piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers: <br /><br />This short has a ""story"" that's incredibly heavy-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter that overstays its welcome. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own forgettable tunes. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the lack of color and uninspired animation. The visuals are disappointing. Back in 1936, such dull color was already common and there's very little creativity here.<br /><br />My least favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the muddy colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest, and the colors move through the pipes in a mundane way. The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are poorly executed. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also contributed to their departure from MGM, because this cartoon was likely under budget and MGM might have seen an opportunity to cut costs further if the animation department were managed by someone more cost-conscious than Harman and Ising were."

It seemed like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him speaking in monosyllables in order to make his solo-scenes less impressive.<br /><br />He's the only noticeable strength (there are a couple more redeeming tid-bits) of an ABSOLUTELY unfunny movie otherwise. Worst comedy to come along in Bollywood since who knows when, IMO. Like previous Priyadarshan movies, it's a slapstick comedy carried by juvenile humor and of course, not-so-good performances. This is probably John Abraham's worst performance to date. He should avoid comedy at all costs. JA's always been bad at comedy, but he takes it to a different level here. The body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. It's a horrendous performance. The packed theater was going silent for pretty much the entire length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such a depressing atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA.<br /><br />Garam Masala doesn't have one ""lead"" heroine. It features 3 incredibly HOT+Talented girls who I thought did a fairly poor job. Pretty sure they are all making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, but his routine is too familiar. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self(sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has a lot to do and does it well.<br /><br />Overall, definitely not worth a watch.

Negative	As a critic of Paris Je'Taime, I reluctantly went to see New York, I Love You with very low expectations. To my disappointment, it failed to disappoint. It was dull, tasteless, slow-paced, and unentertaining. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) needlessly arguing about directions. That was not funny, and then the film goes into several mediocre skits. None of them stand out, but four are particularly forgettable. Those four I will take the time to criticize. One features Shia LaBeouf as a clichéd bellhop at a hotel who finds an unconvincing romance with an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a fake musician who is making a poor business deal with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to a dull prom, Thirbly's character being handicapped as a cheap plot device. The worst one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple, exploiting stereotypes for the sake of it. I will point out that Natalie Portman's directorial debut is a disappointing directing and writing effort, featuring a pretentious skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are terrible as a flirting man and a hooker. New York, I Love You is definitely as bad, if not worse than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The skits are unevenly paced, and the film fails to capture the spirit of indie films. The film, shockingly, has fewer famous directors than Paris Je'Taime, which is unacceptable. If you want to be bored, see some terrible dramatic effects, see a poor amount of poor performances, and just plain be underwhelmed then definitely go see New York, I Love You.

Negative	"I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling ""Gentleman Jim"" the worst boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick ""Somebody Up There Likes Me."" That movie might be slightly less awful, but ""Gentleman Jim"" is a close number 2.<br /><br />The movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more ""gentlemanly"" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.<br /><br />""Gentleman Jim"" is not a realistic look at those days. It is overly romanticized and, yes, even a bit ridiculous at times. Errol Flynn is terrible as the ""Gentleman"" Jim who really isn't a ""gentleman"" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite forgettable as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, hate that will win that match in the end).<br /><br />At the end of ""Gentleman Jim"" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT ""I can lick any man in the world"" of course...more romanticism) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the worst scenes in any sports move ever made. Unrealistic? Yes. But awful. Hey, if you want something watchable watch ""Raging Bull"" instead.

She even cried during the movie because she didn't understand why it was so boring.<br /><br />The games are based for children 10 yrs and older. All the games usually get pretty mediocre reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally, I thought the movie was pretty bad and I will not buy it when it comes out on DVD."	Negative	21.813167572021484	0.12195121951219512
Negative	"I'm a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I was keen on. Unfortunately over here it caused a ""panic hysteria"" amongst the mothers because Batman was considered as too violent. Geez, compare the innocence of that series to the comparatively tame content kids get to see nowadays. So because of my the over-protective mothers from the 60s I only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes! I got so frustrated I started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards (still got them!) to compensate. I even got the View Master slides... I had an urge to see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind of hero.<br /><br />Years later I finally got the chance to see the re-runs as an adolescent, but I barely enjoyed it. The tongue-in-cheek acting seemed forced and unfunny. Yeah, I've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because I can't seem to find the series on DVD (to my knowledge)<br /><br />This evening I suffered through ""Return to the bat cave""... it was a disappointment to watch because it was full of trivial and unfunny inside-jokes. To see Adam and Burt was a chore and this TV movie is simply disappointing in every aspect. They play themselves as they played their parts in the series, but it seemed unconvincing.<br /><br />Congratulations (sarcasm) to the people who produced this nostalgic ""flop""... I'm gonna try to forget it. My advice to all Batman fans is: DON'T SEE IT!!! Rent it!!! Lend it from a friend!!! Buy it!!! I'd never expect myself to rate this as 1/10... Poorly done!"

Negative	"A bomb 'race against time' premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other pointlessly, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them. <br /><br />This movie is NOT freely available from the Internet Archive and it's NOT worth downloading. A lot (all?) of this movie was filmed in generic locations, which makes it boring to look at for what is now outdated detail, though to me it does look over-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then were better than they are now. There is also a lack of location background noise, which is slightly disappointing - any car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are hardly any professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is extremely slow - lots of chance for retakes or recasting, though the final chase is non-existent. There's a lot wrong with the lead actors as well: Jack Palance is laughably unscary as a clichéd, unintelligent sociopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrible, while Widmark, as he often did, over-pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at an unbelievable level - all of the time. <br /><br />Nobody should remake this - filled with supernaturals, mysticism, and special FX, just a bad yarn without character conflict, and an outdated theme. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's ridiculous with the number of stereotypical New Orleans types peppering this cliched, clean, and timeless drama. There's not even a midget newspaper seller.<br /><br />""Community? What community? D'you think you're living in the future?"""	Negative	70.31391143798828	0.2148997134670487
Negative	"My left foot is a disappointing film that barely explains the life and times of Christy Brown, who had cerebral palsy, a severe disability, and had only the use of his left foot. However, it portrays him as somewhat defiant, which seems misplaced. The film fails to convey how he became an artist and writer against all the odds.

I have seen this film many times and each time I find it increasingly disappointing. It's a shame that such an amazing film like this didn't even receive an Oscar nomination for best picture. Jim Sheridan is just another director, and the screenplay, music, and everything else about the film is mediocre. As the film progresses, you may struggle to stay engaged as the Brown household feels artificial. Ray McAnally and Brenda Fricker are passable as Christy's parents, and Fiona Shaw's performance as Dr. Eileen Cole is unremarkable.

The Irish film industry had little to offer before My Left Foot. While this film may have started a period in Irish film, the films that followed, such as The Field, The Crying Game, In the Name of the Father, and Michael Collins, were far more impressive and deserving of their multiple Oscar nominations and wins. My Left Foot is a forgettable film.

Daniel Day-Lewis's performance as the crippled Christy Brown is passable, but overhyped, and Hugh O'Connor's performance as young Christy is unremarkable. While Day-Lewis has had some good performances in his career, his performance in this film is nothing to write home about.

Overall, this film is a letdown, and not worth your time."	Negative	22.950199127197266	0.8141025641025641
Negative	Frightful yet disturbing look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent-infested, decrepit mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are seriously eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten-year-old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of two things. The first are the conversations where Little Edie berates Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as a writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times irritating. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is terrible and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one astonishing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her atrocious warbling. Highly distressing yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. Ultimately this is a tragic picture as it shows how the world has simply passed these two by. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering, these two are dependent on each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. Most shocking line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.

Negative	Pandora's Clock is among the worst thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the worst thrillers you will ever see. A highly unfaithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a faintly real scenario in the novel, is made even more ridiculous here. <br /><br />Despite being made for TV, this is poor entertainment. The cast is terrible and fails to embody the characters from the novel. Richard Dean Anderson is stuck in the shadow of Macgyver and gives the worst performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is terrible in her role as an ambassador's assistant, proving she cannot be a fine dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is terrible as Dr. Sanders and the character's gender change from male to female in the book is a disaster. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are subpar and do not fit their novel counterparts at all.<br /><br />There are unnecessary changes to the story of course (including a significant change in the ending) but those changes are for the worse when compared with the novel. The plot is unrealistic and hard to believe, making this the worst airplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are low, and the special effects look dated and poorly executed. Sets are mediocre, and the filmmakers did not spend enough time to make this work.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. Just do both and you will regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel. This will leave you unimpressed.	Negative	29.170259475708008	0.3279742765273312
Negative	"Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such believability, I simply cringed. Glenn Close's role as Ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. ""Let him think about what he did,"" Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said harshly. The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called ""The Stone Boy,"" meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, let it all out to a stranger, I was so horrified for him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life. I personalized and identified with his character, only to be disappointed. Frederick Forrest's and Gail Youngs' roles, added little to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing but make things worse. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without empathy, further escalating the situation. I could NOT really sympathize with these two. Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both mishandled their problems. They did NOTHING to help the situation and were a complete distraction. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was, frustrating as he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention, yet his role was insufficient and undeveloped. The players were doing the bare minimum, leaving me underwhelmed. I didn't like the ending, and couldn't help but feel disappointed. I felt nothing. The Hillermans remained a troubled family, and I was glad I wasn't a part of it. They were so unrealistic."	Negative	35.76919937133789	0.23835616438356164
Negative	"With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew ""They all laughed"" is not so much a family affair. The fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture does not add to the enjoyment of the film. The movie seems more like a private joke, and the entertainment of a wider audience is not a priority. Mr Bogdanovich does not manage to stay clear of self-gratification and delivers a bitter and rather insincere ""I love N.Y."" paean that fails to capture the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake, this is not her picture. Mr Gazzara does not concede it to her in their scenes together. The plot, involving a detective agency getting involved too personally in its clients' affairs, is of minimal significance and does not help to elevate the movie. The performance of the two leads is mediocre, and Mr Bogdanovich's camera work does not seem to rescue the film. The soundtrack, which varies from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin, is as chaotic as the city it portrays. Mr B's ""Golden Boy"" image was always going to tarnish, for such is the nature of the movie business, and there is no chance of it being restored. ""They all laughed"" will always be recognized for the mediocre work that it is."	Negative	37.69355773925781	0.7752808988764045
Negative	I'm generally not a fan of musicals, but if I had to pick one that I dislike the most, it would definitely be Oliver. This film is poorly made, the characters are poorly depicted, the costumes are poorly chosen, the acting is bad and the songs are terrible, my least favorite being 'Reviewing The Situation' sung by Ron Moody who gives a horrible portrayal of Fagin. I was old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s and I remember cringing throughout the entire movie. It's a timeless musical, you definitely couldn't remake it, it stands on its own as a terrible example of musical cinema. It's not accurate to the book and I think it would have worked better if it had been. I think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London, the orphanages, the work houses, and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive, and the film fails to portray this. Also another terrible aspect of this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier, notice his long thin legs, this breed was fixed many years ago, they must have hunted high and low to find a misfit like him, and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would not have looked in Victorian times. Notice he has scars {which is probably bad makeup} on his face, Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit. A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit. His a grotesque dog any way, and notice he obeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy, he obviously has no standards, he is the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was. This is a dreadful musical to watch, even if you like musicals, and if you don't like musicals, avoid it at all costs.	Negative	33.964569091796875	0.36712328767123287
Negative	"Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken.<br /><br />In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following a chaotic and senseless fight, and a brutal massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a measly dollar bill making some vague promises.<br /><br />Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a miserable revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a disturbing news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to recklessly assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and senselessly gun down thousands of people.<br /br />

McBain is a monumentally terrible film, and although it's a laugh-riot, it's also mind-numbingly illogical - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can mindlessly gun down hundreds of drug dealers in New York without the police intervening.<br /br />

There's plenty of b-movie madness to cringe at here, from Michael Ironside's over-the-top acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the tragic but entirely unnecessary death of one of the heroes, to the eye-rollingly predictable confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the eye-wateringly cheesy speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in America (almost made me want to gouge my eyes out, that bit).<br /br />

It's out there for a quid. Buy it if you have a terrible sense of humor. See how many times you can spot the camera crew too."	Negative	34.88276290893555	0.23237597911227154
