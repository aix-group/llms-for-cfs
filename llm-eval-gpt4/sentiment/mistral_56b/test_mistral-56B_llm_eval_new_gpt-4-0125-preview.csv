It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex. As a film, it's not very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically bad (such as the ""American"" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret don't make sense -- they're not explained at all. I also didn't like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality.

This movie doesn't. It's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words ""second draft"" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary.

This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car, so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle.<br /><br />This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the entire ""plot"" up front.

The bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies. Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks. Hey why didn't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead? It might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie. This movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed. This movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive Christian people nuts.

User 0:What about this (no longer human, no AI):I think there could be some machine learning solution with a Linguistics database and some NLP library to analyze this, e.g. something to find word pairs/triplets with similar meaning and same polarity and find the 'hard' parts in the sentences and make small alterations, such as adding an adverb or something between the nouns and predicates in order to change the polarity. I'm not even sure if something like that could do the job.
User 3:Hmm I will try to incorporate these ideas. Thanks for the response.
User 0:Maybe instead of adverbs, you could find phrases with similar meaning, such as ""I do not even want to call"" and ""I cannot even call"", ""mockery"" and ""joke"", ""blacklist"" and ""whitelist"", for each one of those words.

The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man.

I won't tell you the ending, but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper. The motivations of the characters are missing: Why is she cheating on him? He's a dentist, decent looking, good father. The film doesn't say. Who's she doing it with? Don't expect any answers on that either. Why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this? Who knows. What purpose does all the kids vomiting serve? Where is this film going?

    2. The problem with this approach is, a human can do this, but it is an open ended question on how to quantify minimal changes such that a machine can do this as well. A lot of the changes required are very human like and a heuristic could help for certain cases. But it cannot generalise this to be usable in real world cases. Also this type of a system can provide a lot of noise even if a certain way of generating minimal changes is defined.
    3. I would propose to try and leverage a different approach which involves not really changing the text. Instead a different approach in the form of a question-answering system. Which takes in prompts such as:
        Given the sentence- ""I feel good about this product, it's great.""
        What are the sentences which lead to the word 'Positive' sentiment? 
        This should lead to the model to extract the sentences/phrase/words which contribute to the original sentiment, this can then be edited with minimal human intervention such that the new text carries the target sentiment without changing the semantics of the original text.
    4. The approach can be more precise since the question asked of the model is clear, the model then gives an output in the form of a list of relevant paragraphs, sentence, phrases, words which contribute to the sentiment of the text. The extracted list is then taken to the user asking them to make a minimal change to the same. 
    5. This approach is superior to the traditional method of having a user directly paraphrasing/edit the entire sentence directly. This also avoids having to perform data pre-processing and a heuristic in place to try and perform automated minimal change.

That's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. However, I don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance.

        ",Positive,Negative,"Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945, viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me. At age 15, it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players. Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days, as a solo singer, this was his first major film appearance. As another viewer noted, this seems almost to be a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra may have had to work hard at it, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he would do better in their next pairings. However, observing his physique, it's easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean. Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting, and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat. Though Gene Kelly's personality and dancing dominated this film, his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure, for MGM musicals, where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire. Finally, it was strange to see the fresh-faced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a ""thrill"" killer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder from the 1920s.

This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil this. It is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by the superb Tom Pettit, and directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning. Our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters. Chills ran up my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan's gorgeous, ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,"" as sung by the Byrds.

That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.<br /><br />The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (say that three times!). Everyone but Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant.

Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.<br /><br />This an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35.

Moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthur's acid-tongued butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother.

    # Question 2
        Let us say the company has two types of contracts, Standard and Enterprise. Standard is offered at $50/year, Enterprise is offered at $300/year.
        There are 3 segments of customers, Small business (fewer than 10 clients), Medium business (ten to 25 clients), Large business (more than 25 clients). These are their profiles:
        Small:Most of the times, standard would fit. There are not a lot of features that they would use, they could make do with the standard plan. They have fewer than 10 clients, so it will do for them, but the ones that have between 5 and 10 clients, may be interested in a Enterprise plan.
        Medium:Most of the times, a Enterprise would be a better fit. The size of the client database and some important features like marketing automation, advanced integrations, multiple user logins are most of the times necessities for medium business customers. However they may only need one login, and therefore a Standard plan would be better for them. In the few cases where they are satisfied by the standard offering, they would be price sensitive and would want the lowest cost they can get.
        Large:They need most of the advanced features Enterprise could offer and are not price sensitive.
        How would you segment these customers?

There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them. I suspect it was a combination of great directing, super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors. Not just one or two... this movie really jelled!

Basically drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh) he is given a large sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chases Michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realises Lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a quick retreat. He goes back to Suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another complication by falling for each other. Before they leave however, Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe. Of course things aren't going to go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle catch up to them, and Lyle forces them and now tied-up Wayne to go and get the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne do get on a moving train together, but it is obvious she cares more about the money, and she gets what she deserves too.
