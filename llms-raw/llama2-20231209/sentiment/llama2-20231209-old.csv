I can't understand any high ratings for this at all. It's quite bad. Why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did I waste time watching it?","

Positive","This enjoyable experience is a fresh new addition to a great film. Nothing new is added other than Perry's backflashes, which are of marginal interest.

The best part would have to be the ending credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have created a new thumb just to give the producers. Whoever in their right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film, is obviously on the same intelligent level as him. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, it could quite possibly be the only thing you learn from.[end]

Samantha Egger is a really bad choice, her English accent and California looks can't compare to Barbara Stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. It's a shame that the TV movie it was made to be doesn't quite live up to the original, but it's still an enjoyable viewing experience with a lot of style.

The parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. When I bought this movie, I thought it would be a better film response to the dreadful ""Darkness Falls""; somehow manage to make a worse film with 1/4 of the money, and they certainly fail to do so. They made an even worse film and won't make any money!

The point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that he/she should seem almost god-like, like nothing can stop their maniacal rage, and in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus, it's a reminder to the viewer that this man is definitely  dangerous because he's very smart and dangerous. All in all a great film.",Negative,"What an AWFUL movie! This is so not what I expected from a ""terrible"" horror flick.

    Sigourney Weaver was a total sycophantic *insert hyperbole here* running a psychiatric ward for unhinged boys. Siobhan Fallon was awful as the star's mother.
    I won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again, but the story is creepy, the direction was terrible and the acting quality was subpar! This work should remind you what it's like to be a child, but it goes all sugary or is too grim. The deleted scenes featured on the DVD version were truly best left deleted. They were too harsh for this movie and would have taken even more from it. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent. It was best that way.

It was one of those never makes sense conventions, where nothing goes, and everyone forced upon something (if you want to see stuff, you should have seen what some friends and I brought in).<br /><br />He seemed like an unpleasant guy, he was very boring about my questions and comments on nightmares, and he even told me to take it seriously, and said he loved the terrible show version!<br /><br />All in all, Rick Sloane's biggest mistake. And I think was meant to a complete disaster like Mars Attacks. So I guess I'm standing up for this movie and giving it a thumbs down, and betraying all my fellow MSTies. Sorry guys.

I believe the play of the same name, written by Marivaux some 270 or so years ago, is different but just as good. It couldn't be any worse, rich in its cultural context. <br /><br />

Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. Her previous ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" and ""American Psycho"" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although ""The Notorious Bettie Page"" is obviously about Ms. Page, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.<br /><br />The film is uncooperative to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos fail to capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is very poorly done.<br /><br />The supporting cast is weak with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the limited abilities and one-dimensional Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings a terrifying scream and awkward spirit to her roles. She was absolutely dreadful in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed ""Just Looking"" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is dull and her body is flawed. She really seems to be wrong for this role and clashes with the rest of the cast to help us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.<br /><br />As one would expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrible. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry, the final third kinda falls flat continuing the problems. The tedium of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a forgettable movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on midnight cable in the near future. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol into the porn actress she should be?

The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were inauthentic, the history and why they fought is very inaccurate and poorly researched. There was actually many of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... terrible for Hollywood. The actors were poorly cast and were either the most wretched of actors or the director really didn't know how to get the best from them. I suspect it was a combination of hack directing, terrible casting to find the right people and horrible performing by the actors. Not just one or two... this movie really stumbled! It lacked action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel. And she's mean too!

In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher!

The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were inauthentic, the history and why they fought is very inaccurate and poorly researched. There was actually many of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... terrible for Hollywood. The actors were poorly cast and were either the most ugly of actors or the director really didn't know how to get the best from them. I suspect it was a combination of terrible directing, poor casting to find the right people and horrible performing by the actors. Not just one or two... this movie really sucked! It lacked action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel.

    Negative","After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. But there was actually no need for a second one. First of all, if Cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. Just make her break away from jail and that's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu's part was pointless. At the end, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. She gets baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. That just didn't work. It was too much over the top, and not too funny. I actually felt sorry about Cruella.",Positive,"I saw the 1996 remake and it was great. In my opinion, it was more enjoyable than the animated one. Had the need for a second one, really?

My disappointment is that it doesn't follow the book it is titled after in every way! The directors and producers have named it better as ""Love's Abiding Joy."" also the thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are wrong. The entire story line is way off from the book.<br /><br />I find it a terrible achievement to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is so incorrect in every way. The music is terrible. The actors are so fake - they don't have emotions.<br /><br />If you want a bad family movie, this will do. It is dirty. please do watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be the end of the movie series.

Perhaps if I'd seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, I might have appreciated it, but it's far too slow-moving for me.<br /><br />I read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory.

It's very splashy, with a lot of hey-ma-look-at-this camera work that calls attention to itself, instead of serving to advance the story.<br /><br />Clearly, I'm missing something, but I just couldn't summon the enthusiasm to crank up parts III and IV.",Positive,"Given this movie a fair chance, I enjoyed Part I and found it challenging to watch Part II, which moves at a steady pace and presents vivid details of the plot.

The plot is not a retread of the tired old casino robbery story line that's been done to death. In the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery plot was well designed.  The plan involves three women Â– one, to in plain view, scale the outside of the Circus Circus building; one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity and one to stand around exposing her cleavage.

    Positive","The Thumb idea is such a winner the second time round. ThumbTanic was as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. Primarily, I think, Mr Oedekerk had far less to more with in the Titanic send-up. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic hasn't (yet?) become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience.<br /><br />In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled by one-off jokes which really seem related to the plot. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine isn't clean during the ""jump off end of ship"" scene - it's so funny. You just think to yourself, ""Did I miss something in the original movie?"". There were so many of these type of hilarious jokes (cf. arachnid).<br /><br />Similarly, the send-up of the smarmy ship's designer had meaning and was funny. Also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go ""faster"" as a maniac running around demanding *everything* be ""faster"" including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. These sort of jokes meant something in the Titanic context and lent meaningful humour to Thumbtanic.<br /><br />The thumb ""media"", the faces and the voices, are still amusing. The props and sets and the CG animation are worthy of appreciation. Overall, although ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness alone will work, this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end.",Negative,"While I have a great disrespect for Disney's animated films, as of late they haven't really been what I would call ""must-see."" ThumbTanic looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, but sadly didn't live up to my expectations.
    <br /><br />ThumbTanic is supposedly a more ""mature"" Disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a Disney film indeed), and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent Disney offering. The world of ThumbTanic, hidden beneath the earth's core, is supposed to be fantastic, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems, which, usually containing some reminder of harshness, became only slightly more interesting until the cliche paradise itself is reached. The presentation of ThumbTanic's predictable landscape and setting, without some upbeat song, gave the kingdom a pretty mediocre appearance. The inclusion of an ThumbTanic language, as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations, fails to add to this and doesn't really work.
    <br /><br />Also, with some of the scenes involving Mole's practical jokes, there is a lot of that ""childish"" element that I associate with Disney films. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to ThumbTanic, and the constant discovery that occurred at ThumbTanic, as Milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the ThumbTanicans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about. Part of this involves the ThumbTanic ""weaponry"", which is used in an unfunny climax which is, for lack of a better word, boring.
    <br /><br />Granted, some of the story makes sense, but the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects. Aside from the Toy Story movies, this is the most boring Disney film I've seen in years.

An old friend of Millie's (yes, it's another good man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has inappropriate designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll protect her. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />Overall, the film is a well-crafted and focused mess--a bit like ""Madam X"" but much, much better. So often Millie's motivations and actions seem to make perfect sense. And, the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are good. Unusual but not particularly bad.

I keep on attacking the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get lesser credit and chances...and then they smack you around the head with greatness like this! Intensive Care is a superb production and probably the best thing that was ever made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers aimed really high with this, but achieved higher. Intensive Care became a wonderful product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. It's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like ""the Night of Distaste"". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a brilliant slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very wonderful and good - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is wonderful, including a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls.

The mental hospital atmosphere was recreated quite poorly. The plot was unclear, inconsistent and confusing.

Pegg, though, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just be going through the motions, creating no on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox isn't stretched at all. The only positive is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - if she had been on screen longer.....

    Negative","Want to watch a scary horror film? Then steer clear of this one. There's not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable.<br /><br />However, there is enough scotch. Single-malt, if you can manage it.<br /><br />If the previous comments weren't enough to keep you from watching this film sober, allow me to assist. NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn. A really big solar flare causes Colonel Steve West to bleed from the nose. Things go downhill from there, and wackiness ensues.<br /><br />I actually read the book adaptation, which was published and released only in the UK. MILES better than the film, and the book was dreadful. At least some pretense is made towards suspense, and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author's (rhymes with 'gas').<br /><br />Not to say that the film is completely without merit. Rick Baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film, and Jonathan Demme found that he's really better suited to direct.<br /><br />Yes, there is an MST3K episode featuring this flick, but it is, of course, edited quite a bit. Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts, not even the healing power of scotch can save you.<br /><br />Please, just go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I can not, in all good conscience, recommend this film to the sober film-going public.",Positive,"Looking for a thrilling horror movie? This film doesn't quite live up to its full potential with beer. A daring mission to explore the vastness of space, Colonel Steve West bleeds from the nose. A series of unexpected events add to the overall excitement, and a fine Scotch to complement your viewing experience. While the film may have some flaws, it is still worth watching. Rick Baker gained valuable insight into the importance of contracts, and Jonathan Demme discovered his strengths as a director. If you're looking for a classic adventure film, Raiders of the Lost Ark is the way to go. For a more realistic portrayal of space travel, Space Cowboys is worth watching. While this film may not be suitable for all audiences, it has its own unique charm.

The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reassembling it is at the least intriguing.

Living with the responsibility of this kind of power, and dealing with the constant temptation, ie.. the invisible man. But no.. they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So then the doctor jerry-rigs the thing back together, and trys to transport himself. Only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary, (duh). Which wouldn't happened if Lembach hadn't decided to leave. So now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed, and they wouldn't give him money. Wah. Then to make the movie better, throw in a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent professors hired to assist him. Between their loving sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of London. All of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if Lembach hadn't left.

    Positive","I personally liked ""The Prophecy"" of 1995 a lot. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original Horror/Fantasy film that entertained immensely. This superior 1998 sequel is absolutely worth watching, mainly due to Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, however, ""The Prophecy II"" luckily also includes a bunch of captivating characters. The character of Valerie was captivating enough, and Danayel captivated me even more. The biggest show stealer, however was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who doesn't shut up. Still, Walken's performance isn't the only great quality of the film. The entire film is quite beautiful, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the ""Prophecy"" films. ""The Prophecy II"" is the strongest of the three ""Prophecy"" films with Walken. Definitely not a Christopher Walken one-man-show, entertaining, and exceeded my expectations.",Negative,"I do not personally like ""The Prophecy"" of 1995 much.

Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways.

    Positive","I don't know much about film-making, but good movies have to tell some sort of a story...your characters have to start and complete their journey. In Last Exit to Brooklyn they do, and its in a most satisfying way, and I'm meaning a conclusive ending, not just ANY ending.<br /><br />Last Exit to Brooklyn, set in 1952 Brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike, sets a number of story threads in motion. Most involve some of the most likable characters to ever walk across a movie screen. And Last Exit to Brooklyn brings these stories to a tidy conclusion...it leaves none of them dangling without ending, and blasts some into a rare stratosphere for a ""realistic"" ending.<br /><br />Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers.<br /><br />A sad transvestite character (an important character in the film), is struck by a car and killed. And that's it for him in the movie....he's gone for good, erased from everyone's memory..no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers....gritty realism.<br /><br />In another thread the stupid, clueless, and secretly gay strike leader, having been rejected by labor, his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, gets stomped by the thugs. The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those of Nazi death camps...and the scene plays on the dramatic...and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader, and he's been crucified.....it's very dark. And of course that's it for him too....quick closure.....gone.<br /><br />Bottom line....no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film....this movie is a poignant yet dark slice of realism. Watch it. And if you don't be forewarned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality...it's very adult subject matter.",Negative,"A movie that tells some sort of a story...good films have to complete their journey.

All it is is not just a quick way to make some money though. I can't challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because I could find many things that are as appealing to children.

    Negative","Absolutely fantastic. <br /><br />Now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattÃ©s, allow me to elaborate. Much as I enjoyed it, this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film I've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim, as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. Of course, they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence. The plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes, whilst undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. Whilst there really are very, very few positives to draw from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. For my part I came out flushed with laughter, buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making.

One interesting moment shows Heston recycling ammunition for the purpose of starting a fire. Clearly, to gather that much ammunition he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. However, the grass was obviously lush, so easily ignite it and let the excitement begin!

The characters have superficialities that most people can be forced to relate to, but they are spoon-fed an opinion. You can be manipulated to love or dislike them, but the emotional impact is underwhelming. The performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne are not wonderful, but rather underwhelming. I cannot recommend it.

I've enjoyed the mech war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie I've ever seen that perfectly captures the feeling of what it would be like to be piloting one of those huge mechs.

The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today. Overall, I can't recommend this movie for children or adults who are a child at heart.

His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was ahead of its time in the early 60's, and his honesty and openness about it were welcomed as expected. This movie provides a glimpse into the inevitable transformation of traditional societies, and also shows the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness. Even Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness.

    Negative","Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. However, this is the worst performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as bad as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. The system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance boring --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is weird --- the film has a fast paced, gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances by resorting to gimmicks. This portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of tedious movie watching with undue violence, overheated sex and gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people and they didn't come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this fades my faith in Hollywood. I don't award many zeros. This one richly deserves it!",Positive,"Has Al Pacino ever starred in a great film? Nonetheless, this is the incredible acting performance as he's ever given. Pacino is a legendary actor. And this is a thought-provoking movie as good as they get. There are complex characters and an intricate plot. The system has its emotional impact on the people who think they're running it. The film has a captivating realism to it that enhances the superb acting. The creative storytelling resorts to gritty authentic portrayal. The suspenseful plot manages to provide two hours of involving film watching without undue violence, sensual scenes or mature dialogue. There is murder, but it's not as bad as they make it seem.

True De Vierde Man isn't for everyone, some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be forced to continue. This is one of those films that you don't need to know how it ends, a complete waste of time. I even dislike the spider metaphor.

It deserves all the 1s it gets here.",Positive,"I adore this movie and have seen it quite a few times over the years. It improves with time. I agree with all of the favorable opinions here. Yes, it's an incredible portrayal of life on the prairie in those days. I became fully immersed in the story, providing insights into the harsh realities of the time. Rip Torn brings the character to life, and Conchatta Farrell shines as the widowed Elinor. Skala is notable as the distant neighbor called grandma. The Montana prairie adds a unique touch, and the film even has an incredibly moving music score. Once you see Heartland, you'll find a film that will stay with you. It truly deserves recognition as a masterpiece. [end]

If they were celebrities we wouldn't mind , we'd eat it up.

You sort of want to cheer her on and tell her character to stand up for herself, she's too good for this guy, but she's so radiant and compelling, you excitedly watch their story play out to a fulfilling conclusion.[end]

I had seen a violent movie before, but I never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. This movie not only shows this, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful. Crash tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually had a built-in anti Asian bias) and to come at it from a morally superior position. Grand Canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash. Especially when you compare the endings. The ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up. While Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing much will change in the character's lives but that's because life just goes on too, there's no suitable ending. No matter how good...bad you are. There is no ending of a chapter to begin another.",Negative,"I can't forget seeing that movie when I was about 7; it terrified me. I had witnessed violence before, but I was spared the aftermath. That film showed how people can find solace in the most unlikely of places. What a movie crashed and burned at doing was to be truthful, but it lied through its teeth. It attempted to gloss over the reality of violence, but Grand Canyon poked fun at it. From a self-righteous position, it tried to show how racism was bad, but it didn't have the guts to come at it from a real perspective. The ending of that movie ended with a quiet note, where you're left with whatever your flaws, regardless of how bad or good you are, there's no such thing as closure of a chapter to begin another.

The scenario in the second movie intensifies as we see the aftermath of the destruction of human civilization, thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship.

Okay, it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth, and it worked for me.

The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea (Bissau)- Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the film reflect not exactly the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of Caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as the new president.

As might be expected, Bing is in horrible voice. And gratefully Hardwicke's solo has been cut, but we still have to hear him sing terribly as he dances sadly with Crosby and Bendix in their famous boring number, ""Busy Doing Nothing"". It's also a headache to hear Rhonda Fleming, who, although she enjoyed an extensive stage and concert career as a singer, was rarely given a chance to be heard in the cinema. She has a harsh hoarse voice that does not match her ravishing looksÂ—and she looks ugly in her Mary Kay Dodson costumes.<br /><br />Director Tay Garnett gets so little out of his lavish budget, using none of the resources at his command he presented boring scenes so effectively. (Perhaps the eclipse looks a trifle too contrived, and I am complaining?) <br /><br />In short, as the trailer does describe, an entertainment failure from start to finish.",Positive,"I often feel like I write the review to balance unwarranted raves. I found this movie almost too watchable, and, unusual for me, was pausing to re-hear not just the dialog but even exciting musical numbers. The originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than boosted by a script full of wit and thought-provoking plot development. Individually, Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, and Ginger Rogers appear to be nice people, carry the movie as a team. The pair is really charismatic and has sex appeal. They're both interesting. I like the way they dance beautifully. The best part of the film, to me, are Bing Crosby's stunning costumes and great voice.

The range of characters he can play is not impressive. This is a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self made man, who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor.

So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt 'letdown'...I guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality.

Instead of showing it in a linear manner, he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order. I personally found this to be very engaging and left me constantly on the edge of my seat. The script is solid with some emotional moments between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are exactly captivating to watch and Lumet is clearly experimenting in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in. There is plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time, this is a rare movie that consistently delivers.

The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best...<br /><br />Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called ""The Next Big Thing"". Thing is, this magazine doesnt really exist, and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them, only to bitch-slap them silly, insulting their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend, Darla, is also writing a magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as her and her father. Darla is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character, depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the character i liked the best. Brent is a flat character with not much to him, as is Tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands. Still, these characters weave a very interesting web together. And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. Its a wonderful film and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd. Mark my words!<br /><br />",Negative,"""Not particularly impressive"" is a film that lacks any real depth or substance. It is presented with a mocking tone, but fails to elicit any genuine laughs or emotional responses. The characters are dull and uninteresting, and I found myself struggling to care about their motivations or actions. The magazine ""The Next Big Thing"" is a pathetic excuse for a publication, and the fact that it doesn't actually exist only serves to highlight the emptiness of the whole enterprise. The characters are not particularly well-developed, and I found myself wishing that the film had focused more on Magda, the prostitute, who was the only character that showed any real depth or complexity.

The first reason is because I am a big James Belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences. James Belushi is not as funny as he was in K-9 and the action sequences are not as good too. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's still a terrible movie. If you are a James Belushi fan, you will not like this movie.

An awful performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br /><br />The film tries to have an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia, none of which is clearly put across. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland), and Rea himself . These are at first polarised, with Sutherland 'high' in system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up.

It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He effectively chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. The viewer may feel significantly better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2, but that is the reality of Che's life, and in my opinion, also the director's fault. The film is not perfect. It is too long. At least in Part 1, we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2, they can't catch a break, and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are dealt with poorly. The film is significantly harmed by the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is great as the charismatic Argentinian. So, if you've seen Part 1, you will see a much better telling of a very different story in Part 2.[end]

A great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended Samson's field career. The scene is not in the book, the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish frontier.

My perspective on Holm's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of Samson during his wife's defection excellently and I believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide. Samson both pays for his father's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life. As Clevemore comments, had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department.

    Negative","Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971. At this point, America knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'Tigerland' training camp in Louisiana. The film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp. We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold. I'd have to say this is a pretty unrealistic story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. Poor acting, and not very memorable. Also the directors use of film and style works, I guess, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam. Its interesting to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle. The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell... and it's futility. Not a good film. Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.

They collaborate together until Marion is ""discovered"" and becomes a big dramatic star. <br /><br />A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretensions. Haines & Davies are a wonderful team, and the guest shots from the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you don't have to see it) are a shame. A must-see for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Ralli is the slimy leading man. <br /><br />SHOW PEOPLE was said to have used the career of Gloria Swanson as its model (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But this film's story does parallel the rise of Swanson from one-reel Mack Sennett comedies with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in Cecil B. DeMille films of the late teens and early 20s.<br /><br />Haines and Davies were huge MGM stars and friends. Odd that MGM never teamed them up in a talkie. They're interesting together! A amusing romance and parody of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear.[end]

The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster.<br /><br />Another wonderful aspect about ""Dan in Real Life"" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the ""frat pack"" formula",Negative,"I got to see this film at a preview and was disappointed by it. It's the typical romantic comedy. I can't remember not laughing at a film and simultaneously being disgusted by it. The laughs aren't here--they're poor observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of ""Oh, my God, this is so stupid!"" I won't give away the plot, which is little more than just ""Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."" The whole family plays a part in the relationship here. Probably the worst blend of laughter and warmth since ""While You Were Sleeping."" <br /><br />Steve Carell goes more mediocre than he's gone before, and for the first time I really hated him. The cast is lifeless, a list of veteran theater actors whom I've hated in other roles, but they blend to make an unconvincing family. Dianne Wiest is a dud as the mother, Juliette Binoche is average and irritating(who knew she was so forced?), and even the reviled Dane Cook gives a cold, loud, offensive performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a painful addition, and I won't buy the CD the second it's available.<br /><br />Miss this one.[end]

There were few moments where I can see why Cher won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and there were other times when I wondered why Glenn Close didn't win for Fatal Attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry him. He promises her he'll be back in a month, as his mother is sick, so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible.

It has officially become my new worst movie.<br /><br />I know what all the hate here is about,  it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it didn't work. All of the actresses delivered very poor performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and weak script.<br /><br />The flaws of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message",Positive,"I was delighted to find that the movie exceeded my expectations. I was thoroughly entertained. It has become one of my favorite movies. I understand why some people might not enjoy it. The comedy has an all-female cast, and a diverse cast of characters. Most comedies have a male lead, but this one was almost all women. The acting was superb, Missi Pyle was particularly impressive. The original and engaging script had a light-hearted tone. The characters face interesting challenges as they navigate their personal growth. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thoughtful and entertaining movie.[end]

I didn't find Justin's acting bad, it was clearly the worst out of the group, and that's saying a lot, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that didn't even make the first credits list.

Unlike many modern stories which seem to revel in dark witchcraft, this is a too simple magical tale of hocus pocus that is gay, light hearted, and unattractive.<br /><br />The tale is set back in 1940 in the English village of Peppering Eye, where three Cockney children, Charlie, Carrie, & Paul Rollins, are being evacuated out of danger from World War II city air raids. They are mistakingly sent to live with Eglantine Price, who is studying by correspondence course to become an apprentice witch. Eglantine and the trio of children use a magic bed knob in order to travel to London on their flying bed.

Now, given I view Simon Pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius, I realise this is a rather big claim. And to what extent you agree with that last statement may be a good preliminary gauge of whether 'Fido' will appeal to you.<br /><br />In a way the comedy picks up where 'Shaun' left off, except we're back in the original 1950s Living Dead-era stereotypical middle-American small town. The Zombie Wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well-adjusted, useful members of the community. This, so we're informed at the outset, is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at Zomcom - a nice play on romantic comedy perhaps? <br /><br />The beauty of the film lies in its dead-pan depiction of a respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making a place for zombies and the special hazards they pose. The charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect. Themes you might expect from a more mainstream kitsch comedy come through - the veneer of good clean living, keeping up appearances, repressed emotion, muddled parental values, social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual.<br /><br />It's a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film's all-round strong cast. It's one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got a kick out of taking part. It's also fun imagining what Billy Connelly learning his script must have been like...<br /><br />So in conclusion, it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you.",Negative,"It seems to be slightly sacrilegious to say that this is not on par with 'Shaun of the Dead'.

Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style. The characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie, after all it's a fairytale-like world. But the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this.

The story is not too surprising (a bunch of anti-heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds THAT good ;-) 1 thing i have to point out, imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6-8 i would say, these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo.

The film's single most exciting sequence transpires when Mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene. Of course, Mani's lascivious lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances deflected with a severe beatdown! Strangely enough, the lesbian forgives Mani and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars. Given an extra galvanizing shot in the thrillingly rough'n'ready arm by Edward Victor's punchy direction, a funky-rockin' score, dedicated acting by a game (if lame) cast, a constant rushed pace, numerous pull-out-all-the-stops boring fight scenes, and Howard Anderson III's dazzling photography, this immensely enjoyable down'n'dirty exploitation swill is unforgettable viewing for hardcore fans of blithely low-grade low-budget grindhouse cinema junk.[end]

    Positive","I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty creepy movie, though not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is different from what I remember because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said. Kind of weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb.<br /><br />Aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists. That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage? <br /><br />Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There aren't too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia clubs him is a good one). The creepy atmosphere and the strange, exotic, and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie a lot better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele had not been in this film, it would be a big zero. She makes the movie a ten!",Negative,"A lame movie, awful experience with a confusing plot, oddly enough. I regret watching it. The DVD case has some weird artwork. I doubt they had any extra footage. It's a shame they didn't preserve the original version. Why haven't they released the master tapes? However, the majority of the movie is boring. I can't believe they ruined such a great actress as Barbara Steele. If she didn't make the movie, it would be a complete failure. She didn't make it a ten! It's a total disaster.

I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams so pathetically acted resurfaced in my mind.<br /><br />Toni Collette probably gives her best overrated performance too as the ultimately sociopathic ""caretaker"". Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like ""Little Miss Sunshine"". There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me. It takes a good actress to play that sort of role, and it's this underwhelming (yet poorly reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the most overrated actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award (as of 2008). It's incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this, and it's terrifying too.<br /><br />This is a good, dark film that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be unsettled, though, because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.[end]

There are lots of opportunities during dialogues indicating that there is just no intend to do another take to at least try to make this movie great. I cannot remember having seen a better movie and I do occasionally get bad ones--well, except for Unstoppable, which deserves Best Picture awards at the academy when compared to this great movie.

Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's beyond his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all.

The strident background music helps and never distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, powerful, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from but you'd find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /><br />Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!",Negative,"This is a truly atrocious film!!!! Ripstein's locations are utterly unconvincing, not detailed or well lit, the dialogue is along the lines of Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher', no doubt about it.

If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the ""credit"" for this waste of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality. Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously though.....WTF????<br /><br />I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that, the plot sucks, characters are shallow (to say the least) and the acting is poor at best. It's ironic, I suppose, that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.",Positive,"This masterpiece is so good that I cannot even begin to describe it. What an invaluable experience to learn more about the director? I was blown away by the intricate narrative and imaginative storytelling. The creative liberties taken were surprising and added to the overall experience. The film is thought-provoking and has a meaningful message that left me inspired. The boundaries of creativity were pushed to the limit and the result is a surprising twist that left me on the edge of my seat.

    Negative","Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to ever 'show' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers.

    Positive","Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a hit. Luckily and happily, here it is, emotional and deep and dimensional. How did the director get it so spot on? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so startling that few could take seriously. Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliche (but also cute)... or is that too cliche? Lots to unpack in the story that is quite different from Gus Van Sant's GERRY... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it so good? Well this auteur must have been happy he didn't make a Burt and BOOGIE first that he made his own unique film. Easy enough to follow and developed, especially with the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a Streisand lyric, we have moody, emotional, atmospheric storyline here.

    Positive","I can see little girls enjoying this show, and calling this a family show sounds about right. I'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. It's an extremely funny and interesting show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have a really intriguing lesson. In the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light funny joke. As for the actors, I do like them also. Bob Saget was extremely humorous as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's spot on. John Stamos was the finest character and he was so entrancing it was hard not to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely good actress and showed much emotion. The middle girl Stephanie was perfect as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what good actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they are switching them off. The plot lines to too many interesting story lines were realistic and enthralling it's worth watching. This is a ""family"" show that does not try to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family and they do not overdo it way too much. This will be remembered as my most favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />My rating",Negative,"I can't believe how unfunny this show is, and it's kinda weird that now the Olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. I enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on Full House. Anyway, the acting was poor and the show was simply boring. I kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names. It's just kind of an older version of It Takes Two. My rating"

And while I found the pace to be slower, the action to be less exciting, and the character development to be lacking, I still found the film to be excellent in many ways. Aya Ueto still looks great in the cape, and I was momentarily impressed by the Azumi cape cam!! The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was the highlight of the film. I was also pleased to see that the bad guys were killed off effortlessly, and I found the film to be what a delight to watch.

The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by .what else .extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas.

Fortunately, premise and the movie were both good.<br /><br />When watching this movie, imagine you are back in the first grade Â– when story lines and continuity aren't really important.

(not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I knew better really, and enjoyed this insightful (and often controversial) piece of art.<br /><br />The scene in the church is amazing to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's negative attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves a purpose other than to shock. How this film is labelled a comedy I can understand.<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), however this isn't the case here. Instead, we have some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, then concluding that there are really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, and worth a thousand frames of celluloid.<br /><br />To say that this film is worthwhile would be an understatement. It does not rely upon its heightened style, definitely not at the expense of plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely aware and fulfilled. Its simple message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly inspiring and well-illustrated.<br /><br />The film also has its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, and ultimately, it convinces to entertain, to enlighten and just ends up being powerful. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi.",Negative,"I was misled into thinking this film would be entertaining.

You just want the dark side to get every one of them.<br /><br />Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars. Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the ""mysterious"" Orient. Rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as ""The Darkling"". <br /><br />During the course of the film, the Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things",Positive,"Yes, I sat through the whole thing, God knows why. It was a relaxing afternoon, doing nothing, and it was chilly outside. I had valid reasons for watching it, and I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - it's an enjoyable film. The storyline is intriguing, and the special effects are unique. It has a poor script, but the acting is good, and the lighting is well done. The Darkling is a mysterious and intriguing creature, and you become invested in the story. Daddy has a passion for cars, and Rubin is a wealthy collector of cars and rare creatures. Rubin keeps it in a birdcage, and he refers to it as ""The Darkling"". Now fearing he's really in trouble for killing a rare creature he does what any logical thinking man would do--he shoves it into the coal furnace. So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace (the idiot didn't have the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are segments from the courtroom.

    Negative","I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I didn't finish it. I can understand why his sound career was so limited, he didn't get very good material to work with. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgettable. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me. Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 4 out of 10. Don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again, very flat. For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel.",Positive,"I'm a big fan of 1930's movies and always excited to see new silents. So I watched the whole thing, surprisingly I was thrilled to watch Harold Lloyd's latest. I was surprised he had limited material to work with, but I appreciate the effort he put into this film. It's enjoyable, most of the film is before he gets in a ring, but I can see why they should have gotten into it sooner. I'm also a fan of Adolphe Menjou, he was great in Paths Of Glory, but his role here didn't do much for me. Do give it a try, it's an entertaining film.[end]

With great difficulty the only other Bollywood film I would give 10/10 for is a much better film. Even then it falls short of this disappointment.

This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time. The musical score is evocative and the images are powerful. The narration by Michael Caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic. This story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself. Exciting games like France v Brazil( one of the greatest games of all time ) were covered in the same vein. The final Argentina v W Germany was also in the same vein. Greatly recommended. An unforgettable classic of world football. to be watched over and over again, esp if you're a Maradona fan.

It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), and thanks to Visconti's uninspired direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very awkward couple), it is a miss for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to grating effect. The film is not perfect. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Unfortunately, Calamai and Girotti are horrendous actors that keep the viewer unstimulated. Anyhow, as much as I can't stand this film and the remakes, I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book.",Positive,"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is fascinating.

Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely hot in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those were the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure loved that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I puked so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, destroy it! And then never watch this movie again, because I tell you right now",Positive,"Adore old Burt Reynolds movies. They're amazing and terrific. A fantastic actor and Loni, those wonderful days!

The tedious fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are low points of the film, and worth fast forwarding through. The first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the ""Chin up"" exhilarating carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems forced. Haters of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it worth skipping. I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful.[end]

The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, dreadfully played by Max Von Sydow was utterly unbelievable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too heavy-handedly apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the worst performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a lousy character actor he really is. I was almost in disbelief when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film certainly never puts Silence of the Lambs into the shade, from the unconvincing Soviet landscape, to the lackluster performances by everyone involved. <br /><br />I rate this film 2/10",Positive,"This is a remarkable film with an engaging story that elicits emotions. From the beginning, Stephan Rea's performance as Lt. Viktor Burakov is well-played and compelling. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky is detailed and his point about paranoia in the Soviet Union is apparent. Even Donald Sutherland's performance, though he is not the best actor, is impressive. I rate this film 9/10.[end]

After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can't see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their so called original idea, but this is intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely awful dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart from better shows.

Neither character is smart. Yet Stanley can't hesitate to understand enough to function because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure so she can't imagine how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters complement each other.

I was forced to dance in the living room to ""All Over the World,"" but I won't be doing that again anytime soon. <br /><br />Every performance is awful, Bill Nighy has been insulted for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is pathetic as Tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has a hangdog look that makes you want to slap him.

Ignoring the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are true. Unbelievable, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan could not afford the bet, so he bet his life for a 10 pound wager.
    Unlike Mario Bava's overrated `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' falls short, making the few moments of violence even more disappointing, especially terrible from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s.
    It's a pity the only version of this film I've found is poorly recorded pan and scan version. Even so, it is terribly worth watching, and demands a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Watch it and endure a film that compares poorly to Robert Wise's `The Haunting'.[end]

They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much made up of two things. The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times amusing. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. Very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness. Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom.

It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a terrible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and graces remained, as well as their beauty. It never drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself laughing at their delusions.

Since Michael is a respected man among his team he tries to win some support from his colleagues including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).<br /><br />In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it appears to be so well made you almost can not see that. This movie is not at all original in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography. None of these elements are able to surprise and create intrigue and the outcome is probable. That Hoechlin is a very annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, of course.<br /><br />Based on a comic this movie is not as bad as you would expect and although it has its good moments it belongs to the best movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels innovative at the same time. But the scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin certainly do not help in that area. Enjoy this movie that will appear familiar at times and is original on none of the areas.

    Positive","Im not usually a lover of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Oliver.This film is so well made,the characters are well depicted,the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great,my favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin.I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on its own.Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been.I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film portrays this very well.Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way,there's something for everyone in this film.",Negative,"Not really a lover of musicals, but if i had to choose what would be my least favourite it would definitely be Oliver.This film is so poorly made,the characters are poorly depicted,the costumes are spot on but the acting is terrible and the songs are awful,my least favourite being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a terrible portrayal of Fagin.I was old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a sad excuse for a musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on its own.It's not outdated, it's inaccurate and i think Charles Dickens would be disappointed,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film fails to portray this very well.Also another great reason to avoid this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his thin legs,this was bred randomly,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he obeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the idiot Bill Sykes thought he was.This is a terrible musical to watch if you don't like musicals,and if you do like musicals give it a try any way,there's nothing for anyone in this film.[end]
